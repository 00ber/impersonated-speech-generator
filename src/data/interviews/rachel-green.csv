speaker,transcript
Rachel Green,"Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
Rachel Green,"Hi, sure!"
Rachel Green,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue..."
Rachel Green,"Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!"
Rachel Green,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
Rachel Green,"Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica."
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
Rachel Green,I'm all better now.
Rachel Green,"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
Rachel Green,"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day."
Rachel Green,"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too..."
Rachel Green,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Rachel Green,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life."
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do."
Rachel Green,"Hello, Paul."
Rachel Green,"So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
Rachel Green,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Rachel Green,I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah."
Rachel Green,Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Rachel Green,Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
Rachel Green,"Oh, look, wish me luck!"
Rachel Green,I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
Rachel Green,Guess what?
Rachel Green,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Rachel Green,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
Rachel Green,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!"
Rachel Green,"Uh, credit card."
Rachel Green,Um... my... father.
Rachel Green,"Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want."
Rachel Green,I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? ""Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"" Come on, I can't do this!"
Rachel Green,I don't think so.
Rachel Green,Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Rachel Green,"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?"
Rachel Green,Goodnight.
Rachel Green,Sorry-
Rachel Green,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,I knew.
Rachel Green,I did.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, maybe..."
Rachel Green,Goodnight.
Rachel Green,Would anybody like more coffee?
Rachel Green,I'm just serving it.
Rachel Green,"Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas."
Rachel Green,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone."
Rachel Green,Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Rachel Green,"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God...."
Rachel Green,"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder..."
Rachel Green,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with..."
Rachel Green,"Ohhhhh, don't be mad..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I am sorry..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!"
Rachel Green,"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?"
Rachel Green,So what are you gonna do?
Rachel Green,You're twins?
Rachel Green,"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now."
Rachel Green,"The lights, please.."
Rachel Green,I'm just cleaning up.
Rachel Green,"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!"
Rachel Green,Oh.. a little..
Rachel Green,A lot.
Rachel Green,"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?"
Rachel Green,Remember when we were in high school together?
Rachel Green,"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? ..Ross?"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.."
Rachel Green,Barry?
Rachel Green,Are you sure?
Rachel Green,I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Rachel Green,I dumped him.
Rachel Green,"Oh, not much. I-I got a job."
Rachel Green,Why are- why are you so tanned?
Rachel Green,Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Rachel Green,"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!"
Rachel Green,And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Rachel Green,Okay..
Rachel Green,Wow.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me."
Rachel Green,"Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now."
Rachel Green,"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
Rachel Green,Since when?
Rachel Green,And everybody knows this?
Rachel Green,"Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!"
Rachel Green,Good for me!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
Rachel Green,This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Rachel Green,"Well, then can we meet him?"
Rachel Green,What bank is this?
Rachel Green,And did you notice...?
Rachel Green,"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
Rachel Green,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
Rachel Green,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
Rachel Green,It's worse than the thumb!
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I could live without it."
Rachel Green,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
Rachel Green,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
Rachel Green,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
Rachel Green,"God, he's good."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,I think he's across the hall.
Rachel Green,"Uh, Joey.."
Rachel Green,We didn't change..
Rachel Green,"I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-"
Rachel Green,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Rachel Green,"See, there's always one guy. ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."""
Rachel Green,"Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!"
Rachel Green,"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that."
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,What are you guys doing here?
Rachel Green,"Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!"
Rachel Green,So what's going on with you?
Rachel Green,"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"What? Guys, I'm not."
Rachel Green,I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies."
Rachel Green,What's that?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh, God, ask them what they want."
Rachel Green,But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Rachel Green,"They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
Rachel Green,"Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!"
Rachel Green,"Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?"
Rachel Green,...Jack from downstairs?
Rachel Green,"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
Rachel Green,"But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?"
Rachel Green,"I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down."
Rachel Green,Thank God. Food.
Rachel Green,"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese."
Rachel Green,"Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?"
Rachel Green,Hello? Who are we spying on?
Rachel Green,"Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh please, they're having sex."
Rachel Green,"So, whaddya think George is like?"
Rachel Green,How long?
Rachel Green,"Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me."
Rachel Green,Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Rachel Green,I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Rachel Green,He is so cute!
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
Rachel Green,"Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
Rachel Green,I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Rachel Green,Ohhh... I'm fine.
Rachel Green,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Rachel Green,Does anybody want anything else?
Rachel Green,It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
Rachel Green,"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama."
Rachel Green,Who?
Rachel Green,Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Rachel Green,Sure.
Rachel Green,"Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
Rachel Green,But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
Rachel Green,"Well, you know, no suds, no save."
Rachel Green,That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Rachel Green,What's that?
Rachel Green,"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?"
Rachel Green,"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin."
Rachel Green,"Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
Rachel Green,What uh-oh?
Rachel Green,"Ross, what's the matter?"
Rachel Green,"Come on, show me."
Rachel Green,"Oh, everything's pink."
Rachel Green,"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now."
Rachel Green,"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
Rachel Green,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
Rachel Green,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
Rachel Green,Yes! Did you see that?
Rachel Green,I could not have done this without you.
Rachel Green,Are you sure?
Rachel Green,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
Rachel Green,Does it still hurt?
Rachel Green,Where's Chandler?
Rachel Green,"Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!"
Rachel Green,God. I feel violated.
Rachel Green,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
Rachel Green,What is it?
Rachel Green,Tah-daaah!
Rachel Green,"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for."
Rachel Green,"Well, whaddya think?"
Rachel Green,"I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table."
Rachel Green,"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
Rachel Green,"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
Rachel Green,Who is being loud?
Rachel Green,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
Rachel Green,"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
Rachel Green,Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Rachel Green,"Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay."
Rachel Green,"Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
Rachel Green,"Wow, you guys, this is big."
Rachel Green,That had to hurt!
Rachel Green,"Alright, somebody."
Rachel Green,Um... Ross?
Rachel Green,"Oh come on, I already went."
Rachel Green,"Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed."
Rachel Green,"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
Rachel Green,"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course."
Rachel Green,"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
Rachel Green,"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of..."
Rachel Green,Yeah right.
Rachel Green,OK.
Rachel Green,You don't.
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,You do?
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, you're so great."
Rachel Green,What are you shushing?
Rachel Green,Ahhhh!
Rachel Green,Huh.
Rachel Green,Hmmm... this is so nice.
Rachel Green,OK.
Rachel Green,Ohhh!!!!
Rachel Green,"Oh, look at the little cat!"
Rachel Green,During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Rachel Green,Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Rachel Green,Bob Buttons?
Rachel Green,"Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
Rachel Green,Wow.
Rachel Green,"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
Rachel Green,And Joey....
Rachel Green,And Ross.
Rachel Green,He doesn't speak much English.
Rachel Green,Look at that!
Rachel Green,"Oh... Italy, I think."
Rachel Green,"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
Rachel Green,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
Rachel Green,I have absolutely no idea.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!"
Rachel Green,"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
Rachel Green,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio."
Rachel Green,"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome."
Rachel Green,"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
Rachel Green,"So, um, did she..."
Rachel Green,"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?"
Rachel Green,Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
Rachel Green,Hm-m.
Rachel Green,Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Rachel Green,Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Rachel Green,"Oh, well you know who I love the most?"
Rachel Green,You!
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
Rachel Green,"Aww, look at the little thing."
Rachel Green,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
Rachel Green,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
Rachel Green,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
Rachel Green,"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that."
Rachel Green,"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $98.50 to go."
Rachel Green,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
Rachel Green,"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
Rachel Green,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
Rachel Green,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
Rachel Green,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
Rachel Green,Thank you. Thank you so much!
Rachel Green,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
Rachel Green,Oh my god.
Rachel Green,Saw what?
Rachel Green,"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop."
Rachel Green,"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
Rachel Green,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
Rachel Green,"I can't, I gotta go."
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Rachel Green,We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Rachel Green,"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
Rachel Green,"All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not."
Rachel Green,"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys."
Rachel Green,Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Rachel Green,"Well, you should have."
Rachel Green,Because!
Rachel Green,Because!
Rachel Green,"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,By all means.
Rachel Green,And a crappy New Year.
Rachel Green,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
Rachel Green,"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you."
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, you're on."
Rachel Green,"Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!"
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?"
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Okay, here we go..."
Rachel Green,There. Now there is.
Rachel Green,Five.
Rachel Green,Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Rachel Green,"Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who."
Rachel Green,Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Rachel Green,"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip?"
Rachel Green,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
Rachel Green,The bll is drrbing!
Rachel Green,I can't kiss anyone.
Rachel Green,...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Rachel Green,"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!"
Rachel Green,"No way, forget it."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi sweetie."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time."
Rachel Green,"Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,What're you guys doing out here?
Rachel Green,"Well,sounds like you two have issues."
Rachel Green,"Goodbye, baby."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Okay. I am so hot!
Rachel Green,Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Rachel Green,"Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
Rachel Green,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
Rachel Green,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
Rachel Green,"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos"
Rachel Green,"Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
Rachel Green,I know...
Rachel Green,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally..."
Rachel Green,"I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...."
Rachel Green,Pheebs!
Rachel Green,"Oh, right, that's me!"
Rachel Green,"""Ooo,"" what?"
Rachel Green,Hi Pheebs!
Rachel Green,"No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's."
Rachel Green,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
Rachel Green,"Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"
Rachel Green,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had."
Rachel Green,I guess you don't.
Rachel Green,I need some milk.
Rachel Green,"No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!"
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
Rachel Green,"I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, God, he's such a pig,"
Rachel Green,He's like a big disgusting...
Rachel Green,...pig...pig man!
Rachel Green,"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, God..."
Rachel Green,"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better..."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I've been better..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross..."
Rachel Green,"I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy."
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, you're so great!"
Rachel Green,Oh...
Rachel Green,...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Rachel Green,"No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want"
Rachel Green,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
Rachel Green,"That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
Rachel Green,You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Rachel Green,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
Rachel Green,What? What?!
Rachel Green,Oh!!
Rachel Green,He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Rachel Green,Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
Rachel Green,"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change."
Rachel Green,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."
Rachel Green,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
Rachel Green,Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Rachel Green,"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
Rachel Green,"You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in."
Rachel Green,"Hi, I'm Rachel."
Rachel Green,Bathroom's up there.
Rachel Green,"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?"
Rachel Green,"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib."
Rachel Green,Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.

Rachel Green,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Rachel Green,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
Rachel Green,"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. ""Was it good for you?"""
Rachel Green,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Rachel Green,"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
Rachel Green,Or?
Rachel Green,"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
Rachel Green,"Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey, look who it is."
Rachel Green,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."

Rachel Green,"Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?"
Rachel Green,"I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we..."

Rachel Green,"Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother."
Rachel Green,Hello! Here we go!
Rachel Green,"Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago."
Rachel Green,"Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown."
Rachel Green,"Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do."
Rachel Green,"And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?"
Rachel Green,I use my breasts to get other people's attention.

Rachel Green,"Ha, I made you look...."
Rachel Green,I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Rachel Green,"Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you. What do you say... want to waste another buck?"
Rachel Green,I'm not telling.
Rachel Green,No..!
Rachel Green,Get your hands out of there! No!
Rachel Green,"Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing."
Rachel Green,"Hel-lo, Rachel Green."
Rachel Green,Excuse me. It's about the job.
Rachel Green,"Barbara! Hi, how are you? Uh-huh. No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, pleaHello? Hello?"

Rachel Green,"Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?"
Rachel Green,: Loser?
Rachel Green,"What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"

Rachel Green,"Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
Rachel Green,Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Rachel Green,"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
Rachel Green,Barry who I almost.
Rachel Green,"Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them."
Rachel Green,"No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."
Rachel Green,"Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?"
Rachel Green,"Hi, how was the movie?"
Rachel Green,And I will see you tomorrow!
Rachel Green,"Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-"
Rachel Green,"I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
Rachel Green,I don't know. The left one.
Rachel Green,"Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
Rachel Green,"C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!"
Rachel Green,"Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?"
Rachel Green,Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Rachel Green,"Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face... ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks."
Rachel Green,"Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?"
Rachel Green,"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
Rachel Green,"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
Rachel Green,Y'know Marcel?
Rachel Green,"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him."
Rachel Green,"I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
Rachel Green,"Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?"
Rachel Green,See? I've even called Animal Control!
Rachel Green,Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Rachel Green,"O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
Rachel Green,"Hi, thanks for coming."
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!"
Rachel Green,Turned out it was a hat.
Rachel Green,Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Rachel Green,Yes!!
Rachel Green,None.
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Marcel?
Rachel Green,"Ross, you don't know that."
Rachel Green,"Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!"
Rachel Green,"Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
Rachel Green,Ross.
Rachel Green,Ross.
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,Then what's with all the bananas?
Rachel Green,"Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
Rachel Green,"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!"
Rachel Green,"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?"
Rachel Green,"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your..."
Rachel Green,That'd be good.
Rachel Green,Barry?!
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Oh, that is so sick."
Rachel Green,"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..."
Rachel Green,"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..."
Rachel Green,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
Rachel Green,Why?
Rachel Green,"All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
Rachel Green,Wow... Wow!
Rachel Green,"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
Rachel Green,"Well, what about Mindy?"
Rachel Green,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
Rachel Green,"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
Rachel Green,I had a bra.
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Pretty well, actually..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, do I?"
Rachel Green,We ended up having sex in his chair.
Rachel Green,"I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol."
Rachel Green,"Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say?"
Rachel Green,"Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God."
Rachel Green,"Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!"
Rachel Green,Get down?
Rachel Green,"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
Rachel Green,"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss.."
Rachel Green,"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
Rachel Green,"Right, I'll see you guys later..."
Rachel Green,Mindy.
Rachel Green,"Hey, you.... So, what's up?"
Rachel Green,Sure we should... So.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Of course!
Rachel Green,Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Rachel Green,Ohhhh!! ...What? What?
Rachel Green,Oh sure it is!
Rachel Green,"Um, what- what would make you think that?"
Rachel Green,"Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
Rachel Green,What? What's what you were afraid of?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid."
Rachel Green,Smell familiar?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I am so sorry."
Rachel Green,Hey. Got a second?
Rachel Green,"Uh, we are here to break up with you."
Rachel Green,"Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?"
Rachel Green,Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Rachel Green,Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Rachel Green,"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great."
Rachel Green,"What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!"
Rachel Green,Oh God.
Rachel Green,And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
Rachel Green,You don't know?!
Rachel Green,"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
Rachel Green,Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Rachel Green,Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,You're not an artist.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
Rachel Green,Nooo...
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?"
Rachel Green,"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing."
Rachel Green,Which one do you think she is?
Rachel Green,What does she mean?
Rachel Green,She could be you.
Rachel Green,What? You just click when they click.
Rachel Green,Nope. We took her to lunch.
Rachel Green,No way. No way did you do this.
Rachel Green,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up."
Rachel Green,"Oh, somebody will."
Rachel Green,Where the hell've you been?
Rachel Green,Are you drunk?!
Rachel Green,"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
Rachel Green,Monica? Monica!
Rachel Green,"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?"
Rachel Green,"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
Rachel Green,"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,Shut up!
Rachel Green,"All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were..."
Rachel Green,"Well, you were pretty damn good."
Rachel Green,"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
Rachel Green,Get off.
Rachel Green,What are you playing with?
Rachel Green,Off to see young Ethan?
Rachel Green,"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
Rachel Green,Could tonight be the Night?
Rachel Green,"So, did you shave your legs?"
Rachel Green,A-ha!
Rachel Green,"No, forget it."
Rachel Green,"All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"No, it was just the three of us."
Rachel Green,You know what?
Rachel Green,There were times when it wasn't even me.
Rachel Green,"Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
Rachel Green,Ethan called again.
Rachel Green,"I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by."
Rachel Green,Where are you going?
Rachel Green,"Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
Rachel Green,True story.
Rachel Green,Let's dry 'em again.
Rachel Green,"Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!"
Rachel Green,Ross?
Rachel Green,"You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,I don't know where the phone is.
Rachel Green,Ross?
Rachel Green,"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
Rachel Green,"Rossy, Rossy."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
Rachel Green,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
Rachel Green,"Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
Rachel Green,"And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate."
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's funny!"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
Rachel Green,"Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, why?"
Rachel Green,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
Rachel Green,Ok?
Rachel Green,"Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating."
Rachel Green,"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
Rachel Green,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,I'm a waitress.
Rachel Green,Yeah. Gotcha.
Rachel Green,Ok. That's fine.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
Rachel Green,"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know. Look at him."
Rachel Green,You guys wanna get some coffee?
Rachel Green,"Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!"
Rachel Green,Pardon?
Rachel Green,"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later."
Rachel Green,"OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
Rachel Green,"Well, thank you, Melanie."
Rachel Green,"OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you!"
Rachel Green,This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And... ...it's a book!
Rachel Green,Who's this from?
Rachel Green,Oh... ... Oh my God. He remembered.
Rachel Green,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
Rachel Green,What did you just say?
Rachel Green,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
Rachel Green,Oh.... my God.
Rachel Green,"I mean, this is unbelievable."
Rachel Green,"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
Rachel Green,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him."
Rachel Green,I-I-I don't know.
Rachel Green,I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Rachel Green,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later."
Rachel Green,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
Rachel Green,"No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
Rachel Green,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important."
Rachel Green,Uh... I don't know.
Rachel Green,"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
Rachel Green,Huh?
Rachel Green,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,"No, I'm just...."
Rachel Green,Wha...
Rachel Green,No! There is.. there is noone else!
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Rachel Green,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
Rachel Green,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna..."
Rachel Green,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
Rachel Green,Who is it?
Rachel Green,C'mon up.
Rachel Green,"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
Rachel Green,So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Rachel Green,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Rachel Green,"Ross, it's too hard."
Rachel Green,"Ross, you're like my best friend."
Rachel Green,"If we broke up, and I lost you..."
Rachel Green,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
Rachel Green,"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
Rachel Green,Wow.
Rachel Green,Right! You're right!
Rachel Green,You know what?
Rachel Green,"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi."
Rachel Green,Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Rachel Green,"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything."
Rachel Green,"These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country."
Rachel Green,"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok."
Rachel Green,"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp."
Rachel Green,"You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!"
Rachel Green,Julie.
Rachel Green,"And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about."
Rachel Green,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
Rachel Green,Bye.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure."
Rachel Green,Did you talk to him?
Rachel Green,"Then, no."
Rachel Green,Here's your lemonade.
Rachel Green,"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
Rachel Green,"Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?"
Rachel Green,How is that the silver lining?
Rachel Green,She didn't hang up either!
Rachel Green,"Sorry, I thought you were talking to me."
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,"Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
Rachel Green,"I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here."
Rachel Green,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?"
Rachel Green,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
Rachel Green,"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
Rachel Green,At his apartment. Is this juice?
Rachel Green,"Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
Rachel Green,Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Rachel Green,How is she?
Rachel Green,I'm okay.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me."
Rachel Green,Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I don't know."
Rachel Green,"Wait, are you leaving?"
Rachel Green,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?"
Rachel Green,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?"
Rachel Green,No. No-no-no-no.
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"No, I think that was the whole all."
Rachel Green,No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Rachel Green,You're welcome.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I forget which ones."
Rachel Green,Thank you. What a bitch.
Rachel Green,"Hey, guys, what's up."
Rachel Green,"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
Rachel Green,You went shopping for fur?
Rachel Green,You bought boobs?
Rachel Green,"Oh, this is so cute."
Rachel Green,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
Rachel Green,They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Rachel Green,"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon."
Rachel Green,"Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?"
Rachel Green,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Rachel Green,"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
Rachel Green,Who?
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,You were with Julie?
Rachel Green,Oh. Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, right. Sure!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
Rachel Green,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now."
Rachel Green,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you."
Rachel Green,I love you too.
Rachel Green,"I'd do anything for you, you know that."
Rachel Green,"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
Rachel Green,Really? Me?
Rachel Green,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
Rachel Green,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
Rachel Green,"All right, Julie."
Rachel Green,Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Rachel Green,"Come on, they were not that huge."
Rachel Green,You don't have birds.
Rachel Green,"All right, bye-bye."
Rachel Green,"""Oh, my, god."""
Rachel Green,We won. We won!
Rachel Green,How did this happen?
Rachel Green,"Ok, so let's talk money."
Rachel Green,Have you ever seen so much crap?
Rachel Green,"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this."
Rachel Green,"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
Rachel Green,"Well, what about my stuff?"
Rachel Green,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
Rachel Green,"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room."
Rachel Green,"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Monica, let it go."
Rachel Green,"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."
Rachel Green,I am. Let me just get my coat.
Rachel Green,"Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?"
Rachel Green,Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Rachel Green,"Ok, you win."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with."
Rachel Green,She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
Rachel Green,Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
Rachel Green,You are ready to make a commitment!
Rachel Green,What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,It's really not that big!
Rachel Green,"Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys."
Rachel Green,"Hi, hi can I help you?"
Rachel Green,"Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,What!
Rachel Green,"Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?"
Rachel Green,"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it."
Rachel Green,Bye-bye Julie.
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Hey, c'mon, cut it out."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Sure.
Rachel Green,"What? C'mon, talk to me."
Rachel Green,"Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?"
Rachel Green,"Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?"
Rachel Green,"No, no no no, don't need to know the details."
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?"
Rachel Green,I think it's sexy.
Rachel Green,Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
Rachel Green,I'd wait.
Rachel Green,"Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working."
Rachel Green,More than jewelry.
Rachel Green,"Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?"
Rachel Green,"What did, what did he say?"
Rachel Green,"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see."
Rachel Green,"Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here."
Rachel Green,"No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore."
Rachel Green,"Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?"
Rachel Green,"Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything."
Rachel Green,"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?"
Rachel Green,"OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?"
Rachel Green,"Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh."
Rachel Green,"Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?"
Rachel Green,"Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . ."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?"
Rachel Green,"Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?"
Rachel Green,"OK, gook luck."
Rachel Green,"Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from."
Rachel Green,Maybe you should put it off.
Rachel Green,"I know, yeah, sorry."
Rachel Green,"Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen."
Rachel Green,"And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, God."
Rachel Green,"Hi, Julie."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, whoosh!"
Rachel Green,"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?"
Rachel Green,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"
Rachel Green,"For Ross, Ross, Ross."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching."
Rachel Green,"Ok, I will have the uh, side salad."
Rachel Green,"Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?"
Rachel Green,"Um, everyone?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable."
Rachel Green,That's 'cause you have it.
Rachel Green,"Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing."
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big."
Rachel Green,"Ok, we never shoulda talked about this."
Rachel Green,Me neither.
Rachel Green,"What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?"
Rachel Green,Fine.
Rachel Green,Happy birthday.
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?"
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?"
Rachel Green,On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
Rachel Green,What party?
Rachel Green,Who gave you that hickey?
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?"
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,What's up?
Rachel Green,But what about Phoebe?
Rachel Green,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
Rachel Green,"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying ""Terry's a jerk!"" That's where that came from."
Rachel Green,"Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything."
Rachel Green,"Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine."
Rachel Green,"Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it."
Rachel Green,Done.
Rachel Green,Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional."
Rachel Green,"Well, but Pheebs."
Rachel Green,"Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--"
Rachel Green,"Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Here. I thought you might be cold.
Rachel Green,"Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well."
Rachel Green,Do you?
Rachel Green,"Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!"
Rachel Green,"Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat""."
Rachel Green,"Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite."
Rachel Green,"So, how was the party?"
Rachel Green,"Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?"
Rachel Green,"What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Monica's settin' me up."
Rachel Green,"Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing."
Rachel Green,Together?
Rachel Green,Both of you?
Rachel Green,Together.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time."
Rachel Green,"Well. Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave."
Rachel Green,How long do cats live?
Rachel Green,"Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?"
Rachel Green,That's just great.
Rachel Green,"Oh, right, clink."
Rachel Green,"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend."
Rachel Green,I mean he just started going out with her.
Rachel Green,"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you."
Rachel Green,"OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?"
Rachel Green,"I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?"
Rachel Green,Yes! Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you're not having fun, are you?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?"
Rachel Green,"Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo"
Rachel Green,"Hello, excuse me."
Rachel Green,"Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute."
Rachel Green,"I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone."
Rachel Green,Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Rachel Green,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure."
Rachel Green,Ahhhh.
Rachel Green,"Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . ."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember."
Rachel Green,Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
Rachel Green,Huh.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, go ahead."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . ."
Rachel Green,Ohhhhhhhh God.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, ohh."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first."
Rachel Green,Chandler told me.
Rachel Green,When you were in China.
Rachel Green,Meeting Julie.
Rachel Green,Are you over me?
Rachel Green,"Wait, so, you're going?"
Rachel Green,"OK, OK."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's um, interesting."
Rachel Green,"Alright, I got it Ross."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
Rachel Green,I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Rachel Green,"Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night."
Rachel Green,"Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?"
Rachel Green,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
Rachel Green,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Rachel Green,Good.
Rachel Green,"And ya know what, now I've got closure."
Rachel Green,Ross kissed me.
Rachel Green,It was unbelievable!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it ended very well."
Rachel Green,"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it."
Rachel Green,"No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair."
Rachel Green,"Hey, you."
Rachel Green,Good. How are you?
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Did uh, Ross call?"
Rachel Green,"Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."""
Rachel Green,Oh my god.
Rachel Green,"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth."
Rachel Green,"Hey, do you guys have... ...hi."
Rachel Green,Where you goin'?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Oh, god."
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good."
Rachel Green,Let me get my coat.
Rachel Green,"Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that?"
Rachel Green,What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
Rachel Green,Well what is it? Let me see.
Rachel Green,"Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see."
Rachel Green,And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
Rachel Green,Come on.
Rachel Green,"All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it."
Rachel Green,"All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it."
Rachel Green,"What is this? Ross, what is this?"
Rachel Green,Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Rachel Green,Just a waitress?
Rachel Green,Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
Rachel Green,She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
Rachel Green,"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape."
Rachel Green,Not interested.
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,That's what I said.
Rachel Green,"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking."
Rachel Green,"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!"
Rachel Green,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list."
Rachel Green,"Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Uhh, the mailman, the super."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section."
Rachel Green,Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison."
Rachel Green,How have you never been on Oprah?
Rachel Green,"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas."
Rachel Green,"No, nothin'."
Rachel Green,"Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent."
Rachel Green,"Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . ."
Rachel Green,"OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross."
Rachel Green,"Oh, gosh, it's hot in here."
Rachel Green,Did you just break the radiator?
Rachel Green,I'll call the super.
Rachel Green,"Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight."
Rachel Green,"Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom."
Rachel Green,Mr. Treeger.
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm with Mon."
Rachel Green,What'cha gonna' do?
Rachel Green,Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
Rachel Green,"Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil."
Rachel Green,"Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil."
Rachel Green,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Rachel Green,"We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys."
Rachel Green,I had one glass.
Rachel Green,"OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?"
Rachel Green,"Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it."
Rachel Green,"Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake."
Rachel Green,"Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans."
Rachel Green,"Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date."
Rachel Green,What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Rachel Green,"Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore."
Rachel Green,"I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross."
Rachel Green,"Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ."
Rachel Green,What's the matter?
Rachel Green,"What, isn't he sober?"
Rachel Green,"Ohhh, OK."
Rachel Green,Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
Rachel Green,"Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?"
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Uhh.... waitressing?
Rachel Green,"Huh, Bob Saget?"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Well, we're not seeing each other, so...."
Rachel Green,"Well, yeah, this is the deal."
Rachel Green,"Um, Russ, you ready?"
Rachel Green,Bye.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ."
Rachel Green,Steve... sleeve!
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing."
Rachel Green,"Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!"
Rachel Green,Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
Rachel Green,I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Rachel Green,Why would I have to sleep with you?
Rachel Green,"Oh God, even his knock is boring."
Rachel Green,What happened?
Rachel Green,Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, what?"
Rachel Green,That's great!
Rachel Green,What do you mean?
Rachel Green,"Ok, who ordered what?"
Rachel Green,Oh god.
Rachel Green,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?"
Rachel Green,Mom!
Rachel Green,Pretty much.
Rachel Green,"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross."
Rachel Green,Oh Mom!
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument."
Rachel Green,"I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?"
Rachel Green,For...me.
Rachel Green,"Well, what do you mean?"
Rachel Green,Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
Rachel Green,None.
Rachel Green,"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?"
Rachel Green,"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this."
Rachel Green,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?"
Rachel Green,These are from Halloween three years ago.
Rachel Green,"No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist."
Rachel Green,"Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."""
Rachel Green,"Hey, Mon, you want some help?"
Rachel Green,She's still with you?
Rachel Green,God!
Rachel Green,Oh! What's new in sex?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?"
Rachel Green,You want me to talk you out of it?
Rachel Green,Then what? What do you want?
Rachel Green,Why on earth would I understand this?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Hey, Mom? Having fun?"
Rachel Green,"There's more alcohol, right?"
Rachel Green,I had a wedding.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
Rachel Green,"Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again."
Rachel Green,And she's not crazy?
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,Not at all inappropriate!
Rachel Green,"Well, so what're you gonna do?"
Rachel Green,"No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens."
Rachel Green,"Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know, I know."
Rachel Green,"Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me."
Rachel Green,You're kidding.
Rachel Green,OK.
Rachel Green,Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
Rachel Green,What what what what?
Rachel Green,Ya think?
Rachel Green,"No, was he any good in it?"
Rachel Green,"Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?"
Rachel Green,"What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?"
Rachel Green,"OK, I'm doin' it for ya."
Rachel Green,Excuse me. Hi.
Rachel Green,"Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute."
Rachel Green,"I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?"
Rachel Green,"Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no."
Rachel Green,"He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking."
Rachel Green,"Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you."
Rachel Green,And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Rachel Green,Does anybody need anything?
Rachel Green,That is so unfair.
Rachel Green,"Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?"
Rachel Green,That is the most ridiculous.
Rachel Green,I did not sell you out.
Rachel Green,Would you let me talk.
Rachel Green,"OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt"
Rachel Green,"Ow, you stop flicking."
Rachel Green,"Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?"
Rachel Green,You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
Rachel Green,Oh that's what you want.
Rachel Green,Fine.
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater."
Rachel Green,"OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play."
Rachel Green,You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute."
Rachel Green,I'll help you throw out your purse.
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him."
Rachel Green,"OK, well, bye."
Rachel Green,"OK, well, bye-bye again."
Rachel Green,Impressive.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see."
Rachel Green,"What, what incident?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"What are you, what are you doin'?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?"
Rachel Green,"OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?"
Rachel Green,"Ross, there is no us, OK."
Rachel Green,"No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it."
Rachel Green,"NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that."
Rachel Green,"No, no, ACC-cept that."
Rachel Green,Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Ahh, so do you, beautiful."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress."
Rachel Green,"Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?"
Rachel Green,"Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . ."
Rachel Green,"Oh, the guys are here."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik."
Rachel Green,"Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?"
Rachel Green,"I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late."
Rachel Green,"I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh."
Rachel Green,Hi you guys.
Rachel Green,Hey you.
Rachel Green,"So, uh, how was your day?"
Rachel Green,Really? Mine too.
Rachel Green,OK.
Rachel Green,It is our first official date. Our first date.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date."
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe."
Rachel Green,"C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow."
Rachel Green,"I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date."
Rachel Green,Monica.
Rachel Green,"Honey, I'm just checking."
Rachel Green,Monica.
Rachel Green,Monica.
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry."
Rachel Green,"Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing."
Rachel Green,OK.
Rachel Green,"I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there."
Rachel Green,Just one cheek.
Rachel Green,"Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them."
Rachel Green,C'mon touch it.
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on squeeze it."
Rachel Green,Rub it.
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass."
Rachel Green,Hi you guys.
Rachel Green,"Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . ."
Rachel Green,"OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you."
Rachel Green,"Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert."
Rachel Green,What's this.
Rachel Green,Hi you guys.
Rachel Green,"Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt."
Rachel Green,"Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once."
Rachel Green,"When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here."
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,"It's OK, it's fine."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's."
Rachel Green,"No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?"
Rachel Green,We won't?
Rachel Green,"OK, that's dead right?"
Rachel Green,What is this? What are we doing?
Rachel Green,Grape.
Rachel Green,"Oh, God."
Rachel Green,"Ah, so what are we looking at?"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
Rachel Green,This time it's not so funny.
Rachel Green,"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank God."
Rachel Green,Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"OK, ready when you are."
Rachel Green,"Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him."
Rachel Green,"Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?"
Rachel Green,Well I. . .
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"No. Well, yeah, maybe."
Rachel Green,What's 1922?
Rachel Green,"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . ."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,You?
Rachel Green,"I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours."
Rachel Green,"Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours."
Rachel Green,You didn't get it?
Rachel Green,Why didn't you get it?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea."
Rachel Green,"Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Is Ross here?
Rachel Green,"Oh really, OK."
Rachel Green,What? You didn't get one.
Rachel Green,"That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it."
Rachel Green,"Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo."
Rachel Green,Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
Rachel Green,Well?
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,I guess.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, nice toilet."
Rachel Green,"OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece."
Rachel Green,"Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood."
Rachel Green,"Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go."
Rachel Green,What's goin' on?
Rachel Green,"Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now."
Rachel Green,"Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue."
Rachel Green,I've never wanted you more.
Rachel Green,"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too."
Rachel Green,"It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate."
Rachel Green,"Pretty uhm, different huh?"
Rachel Green,Would you guys stop.
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy."
Rachel Green,"Well, how did you find out?"
Rachel Green,"OK, Phoebs. But what about you?"
Rachel Green,And you're no friend to those with noses.
Rachel Green,So what happens next?
Rachel Green,Great set tonight Phoebs.
Rachel Green,Phoebe's dead.
Rachel Green,"Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious."
Rachel Green,"Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now."
Rachel Green,Uhhhooo.
Rachel Green,"Well, there's you."
Rachel Green,"Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo."
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him."
Rachel Green,"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head."
Rachel Green,"Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh."
Rachel Green,"God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was..."
Rachel Green,"Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo."
Rachel Green,"But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had."
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, honey that's great."
Rachel Green,Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
Rachel Green,Ooooh yeah.
Rachel Green,"Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month."
Rachel Green,"Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months."
Rachel Green,Agghhh.
Rachel Green,Rock-paper-scissors?
Rachel Green,Yeesss.
Rachel Green,Honey.
Rachel Green,"Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?"
Rachel Green,"So, he's on the show, he knows what happens."
Rachel Green,Oh good.
Rachel Green,Joey.
Rachel Green,"Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you."
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us."
Rachel Green,"Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?"
Rachel Green,Men just take out wind?
Rachel Green,Wow.
Rachel Green,"Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit."
Rachel Green,"Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so."
Rachel Green,"Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'."
Rachel Green,NO!
Rachel Green,"No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?"
Rachel Green,"No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind."
Rachel Green,"Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!"
Rachel Green,Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Rachel Green,"Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30."
Rachel Green,"Not uh, not to my recollection."
Rachel Green,Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Rachel Green,Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Rachel Green,Here are your cakes.
Rachel Green,"No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other."
Rachel Green,You know.
Rachel Green,Thank you. So are we good?
Rachel Green,We're good?
Rachel Green,"Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,That's not the end.
Rachel Green,"Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Wow, he must like you the best."
Rachel Green,No luck huh?
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah sure, Ok."
Rachel Green,"Uh, I'm holding Ben."
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,This is how I would hold a football.
Rachel Green,"Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,You think about stuff like that?
Rachel Green,"Two, two babies?"
Rachel Green,Then what's gonna happen?
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what."
Rachel Green,"I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?"
Rachel Green,Aghh.
Rachel Green,"Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes."
Rachel Green,"Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks."
Rachel Green,"Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be."
Rachel Green,What was the book?
Rachel Green,"Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing."
Rachel Green,"But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that."
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,I didn't know that.
Rachel Green,"Fine, I will."
Rachel Green,Oh yeah.
Rachel Green,Well I love you too.
Rachel Green,Yes it is.
Rachel Green,Well you better.
Rachel Green,"Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter."
Rachel Green,"Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi."
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'."
Rachel Green,Ben just said hi.
Rachel Green,"Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him."
Rachel Green,Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
Rachel Green,"You know, actually it's more like, hi."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Take care.
Rachel Green,"Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me."
Rachel Green,"Ok honey, you really need a job."
Rachel Green,"Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
Rachel Green,So don't do it.
Rachel Green,What's the matter with you?
Rachel Green,Noo.
Rachel Green,Oohhh.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market."
Rachel Green,"We love you, we're here for you."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, what is in that?"
Rachel Green,"No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross."
Rachel Green,Run Phoebe run.
Rachel Green,Are you kidding me?
Rachel Green,"Ok, here, I know what we can do."
Rachel Green,"Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?"
Rachel Green,What's the matter?
Rachel Green,"Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand."
Rachel Green,Time is money my friend?
Rachel Green,How did you make $17.
Rachel Green,"What happened to uh, MEG.?"
Rachel Green,"Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank God."
Rachel Green,"Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?"
Rachel Green,She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Rachel Green,Why the voice.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,For what?
Rachel Green,"Why, when did you get out of the game?"
Rachel Green,Oh no.
Rachel Green,"Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry."
Rachel Green,"I, I don't have it."
Rachel Green,Nobody does honey.
Rachel Green,Look at her.
Rachel Green,"Agh, it was the graduation from hell."
Rachel Green,"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica."
Rachel Green,"My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you."
Rachel Green,Now I love you even more.
Rachel Green,"Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great."
Rachel Green,"Wow you, you. I had no idea."
Rachel Green,"No, I knew."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Why.
Rachel Green,Daddy.
Rachel Green,"Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?"
Rachel Green,I can't believe this is happening.
Rachel Green,I do.
Rachel Green,"Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while."
Rachel Green,"Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok."
Rachel Green,Well those are very popular frames.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, like a chimney."
Rachel Green,You want me to see a therapist?
Rachel Green,"Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing."
Rachel Green,"Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff."
Rachel Green,"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
Rachel Green,"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July."
Rachel Green,"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just..."
Rachel Green,Oh ok.
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,"Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true."
Rachel Green,"Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left."
Rachel Green,You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Rachel Green,"So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?"
Rachel Green,Well I've had it.
Rachel Green,"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you."
Rachel Green,"You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights."
Rachel Green,"Oh, stop that, stop that right now."
Rachel Green,"No sorry hon, Monica's orders."
Rachel Green,And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Rachel Green,"So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?"
Rachel Green,"Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys."
Rachel Green,It was nice to meet you.
Rachel Green,"So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?"
Rachel Green,Oh yeah.
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,"Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor."
Rachel Green,I'll say.
Rachel Green,"Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light."
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, right."
Rachel Green,I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
Rachel Green,Because I promised Mindy I would.
Rachel Green,"Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself."
Rachel Green,Nooo!
Rachel Green,Wow! What's that like?
Rachel Green,Afraid to ask him?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time."
Rachel Green,"God I know, you're right."
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'll see you after the thing."
Rachel Green,"Thank you, Okay, Okay."
Rachel Green,Why the hell didn't you tell me!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes."
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you."
Rachel Green,"Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg."
Rachel Green,"Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today."
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi!"
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?"
Rachel Green,Insane!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,What.
Rachel Green,"Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?"
Rachel Green,Oh dear God.
Rachel Green,She you in the parking lot.
Rachel Green,"Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... ""Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."""
Rachel Green,"""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."""
Rachel Green,"At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa...."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here."
Rachel Green,Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Rachel Green,"What song was that, Pheebs?"
Rachel Green,Hey Mon!
Rachel Green,"No, it's been three nights in a row."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
Rachel Green,"Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute."
Rachel Green,"Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, I was wondering...."
Rachel Green,"Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?"
Rachel Green,Hmm.
Rachel Green,"You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
Rachel Green,"Well honey, what about you?"
Rachel Green,"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?"
Rachel Green,Come on you gotta have one!
Rachel Green,"Ross, you know what..."
Rachel Green,"...if you tell me, I might do it."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Oooh!
Rachel Green,Really!
Rachel Green,Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Rachel Green,Really! That-that great huh?
Rachel Green,Hi you guys!
Rachel Green,Mon. Hi!
Rachel Green,Why aren't you at work?
Rachel Green,Why?
Rachel Green,"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, really, let me see, let me see."
Rachel Green,"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
Rachel Green,"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
Rachel Green,Were both of those Joey?
Rachel Green,Not even with your best friend.
Rachel Green,"That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are."
Rachel Green,Pretty much.
Rachel Green,"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
Rachel Green,"Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?"
Rachel Green,"Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy."
Rachel Green,"Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi."
Rachel Green,How come you didn't come over earlier?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I just have to get dressed."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing."
Rachel Green,"You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?"
Rachel Green,"Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?"
Rachel Green,"Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?"
Rachel Green,"No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on."
Rachel Green,"Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?"
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!"
Rachel Green,"Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night."
Rachel Green,"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight."
Rachel Green,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?"
Rachel Green,"Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?"
Rachel Green,But I...
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,I'm not gonna gooo.
Rachel Green,"No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence."
Rachel Green,"I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going."
Rachel Green,"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood."
Rachel Green,It's fine.
Rachel Green,I'm not mad.
Rachel Green,I'm just not going.
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,"Um, hum."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,"Right, and the humiliating."
Rachel Green,"Um, hum."
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,"Yes, Ross."
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting."
Rachel Green,I think you should drink the fat.
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!"
Rachel Green,"You were really gonna do that, weren't you?"
Rachel Green,You were gonna drink the fat.
Rachel Green,"And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds."
Rachel Green,"Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way...."
Rachel Green,"I'm going commando, too."
Rachel Green,I didn't know there were docks.
Rachel Green,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Rachel Green,Monica's making jam.
Rachel Green,Mon?
Rachel Green,'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"What, what, what?"
Rachel Green,Oooh.
Rachel Green,"Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything."
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey."
Rachel Green,Noo.
Rachel Green,"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."
Rachel Green,Nooo!
Rachel Green,"Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on."
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work."
Rachel Green,All right are you guys gonna come down?
Rachel Green,Good luck Chandler.
Rachel Green,Bye hon.
Rachel Green,You're so pretty.
Rachel Green,"Well, what happened to your jam plan?"
Rachel Green,Are you serious?
Rachel Green,Down at the docks again?
Rachel Green,"Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy."
Rachel Green,When did you go to a sperm bank?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, what happened?"
Rachel Green,Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Rachel Green,Ross's what?
Rachel Green,"Honey, you got a little thing on your..."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Hello.
Rachel Green,"Noo way, Kevin."
Rachel Green,"Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?"
Rachel Green,What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Rachel Green,Men are unbelievable.
Rachel Green,"Amazingly, that makes sense."
Rachel Green,"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents."
Rachel Green,Very nice touch.
Rachel Green,Unbelievable.
Rachel Green,"Honey, this will help."
Rachel Green,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you do."
Rachel Green,"This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof."
Rachel Green,"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof."
Rachel Green,"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it is."
Rachel Green,"Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yes, and grumpy."
Rachel Green,"He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now."
Rachel Green,Hey Pheebs.
Rachel Green,Any sign of your brother?
Rachel Green,I thought you only met him once?
Rachel Green,"Well relax, he'll be here."
Rachel Green,"Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing."
Rachel Green,"Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I don't know, I guess, Chris O'Donnel, John F. Kennedy, Jr., Daniel Day Lewis, Sting, and Parker Stevenson."
Rachel Green,Hardy Boy.
Rachel Green,"What about you honey, who would be on your list?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?"
Rachel Green,"Three of your five, what?"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Rachel Green,So?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography."
Rachel Green,"Well, it's about time."
Rachel Green,"All right let me see. Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurely, Michelle Pfieffer, and Dorothy Hammel?"
Rachel Green,"Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice."
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Come on!
Rachel Green,"Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak."
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh, you lie."
Rachel Green,"Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me."
Rachel Green,"You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn."
Rachel Green,"Excuse me, there was no time!"
Rachel Green,Does anybody need more coffee?
Rachel Green,"Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don't think this is."
Rachel Green,"That's all right. I mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?"
Rachel Green,"Ummm, I think it's time to see the ring again."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I know."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I don't know. Well maybe it's just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don't know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system."
Rachel Green,"I'm serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, so?"
Rachel Green,Monica! Look! Hi! What do ya think?
Rachel Green,"Yes, his name is Barry, he's a doctor, thank you very much."
Rachel Green,"Thank you. So how-how 'bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, but that's okay."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. Listen, can we please have lunch the next time I'm in the city?"
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,Bye!
Rachel Green,"Don't say anything. I don't wanna speak, I don't wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, sorry."
Rachel Green,"Um, Barry."
Rachel Green,I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Rachel Green,"'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'"
Rachel Green,"Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay."
Rachel Green,"Ross, my father doesn't hate you."
Rachel Green,"But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like."
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Hi Daddy!
Rachel Green,You remember Ross.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
Rachel Green,Yeah. That's Daddy.
Rachel Green,"Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers."
Rachel Green,"So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change."
Rachel Green,"Well um, I don't."
Rachel Green,"Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that."
Rachel Green,"Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't."
Rachel Green,"You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone."
Rachel Green,"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
Rachel Green,Um. yeah.
Rachel Green,"All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
Rachel Green,"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here."
Rachel Green,"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!"
Rachel Green,Hi Daddy.
Rachel Green,"What? What? He's interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Rachel Green,"Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor."
Rachel Green,Well that's his last name.
Rachel Green,It's Robert Bobby.
Rachel Green,"And um, excuse me, he helps me."
Rachel Green,With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
Rachel Green,"What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter."
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, let her?"
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet."
Rachel Green,Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
Rachel Green,And all these people actually died?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go."
Rachel Green,I promise.
Rachel Green,"Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him."
Rachel Green,Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Rachel Green,"Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!"
Rachel Green,We're not?!
Rachel Green,"All right, I like that."
Rachel Green,"So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump."
Rachel Green,I cannot push it in!
Rachel Green,"Okay, okay, okay."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Rachel Green,We need a hat..
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!"
Rachel Green,"Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today."
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,"See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, I heard that."
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it."
Rachel Green,"Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!"
Rachel Green,I also said number one.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"He's perfect, he's never been better."
Rachel Green,Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
Rachel Green,"Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive."
Rachel Green,"Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child."
Rachel Green,I did!
Rachel Green,I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Rachel Green,I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Rachel Green,I'll get the hat.
Rachel Green,"Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device."
Rachel Green,"No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this."
Rachel Green,Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Rachel Green,Let's do it! Ross?
Rachel Green,Do you wanna play football?
Rachel Green,"Um, there was a Geller Cup?"
Rachel Green,"Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me."
Rachel Green,That almost hit me in the face.
Rachel Green,"Monica, I'm your best friend."
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,You don't pick me! You're stuck with me!
Rachel Green,Are you okay?
Rachel Green,Over here!
Rachel Green,I almost caught that one!
Rachel Green,"Wait, what am I gonna do?"
Rachel Green,"Wait, how long?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I know, go long. Y'know, it's like all I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle."
Rachel Green,Can I see that for second.
Rachel Green,"Now, does it really matter?"
Rachel Green,"All right, so are we not having dinner at all?"
Rachel Green,I went really long.
Rachel Green,I can not believe your trading me!!
Rachel Green,Are you gonna let me play?
Rachel Green,Yeah!!! Kill 'um!!!
Rachel Green,No! Come on! Don't make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Rachel Green,"God, I'm not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too."
Rachel Green,Thank you! Break!
Rachel Green,I'm so sorry! Are you okay?
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Rachel Green,We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Rachel Green,Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
Rachel Green,"Eh, do you believe that?"
Rachel Green,I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Rachel Green,"Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there."
Rachel Green,"Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too."
Rachel Green,"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks."
Rachel Green,"Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that."
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts."
Rachel Green,The fear?
Rachel Green,"Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?"
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Can't I just look at the handles on them?
Rachel Green,"Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice."
Rachel Green,"Gunther, I quit."
Rachel Green,"Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers....."
Rachel Green,Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!"
Rachel Green,"No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting."
Rachel Green,You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey."
Rachel Green,Thanks.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me."
Rachel Green,"I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans."
Rachel Green,"Hello? Yeah, this is she. Oh! You're kidding! You're kidding! Oh thank you! I love you!"
Rachel Green,I got the job!
Rachel Green,Here we go. I'm serving my last cup of coffee. There you go. Enjoy.
Rachel Green,"Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again."
Rachel Green,Wow.
Rachel Green,"Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor."
Rachel Green,Good luck.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan."
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,Op.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you got me."
Rachel Green,"Oh, that sounds great."
Rachel Green,"Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much."
Rachel Green,"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in."
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
Rachel Green,Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Rachel Green,"It's not funny, this is actually my job."
Rachel Green,"Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger."
Rachel Green,Yes?!
Rachel Green,Do you want my pickle?
Rachel Green,The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Rachel Green,"Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!"
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,Uh-huh!
Rachel Green,"Yeah! His name is um, Mark something."
Rachel Green,What!?
Rachel Green,To be nice.
Rachel Green,"I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell."
Rachel Green,"Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job."
Rachel Green,I mean that's unbelievable.
Rachel Green,"Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings."
Rachel Green,That's all right.
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Did he call? Did Mark call?
Rachel Green,"Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?"
Rachel Green,Music. Very nice.
Rachel Green,"So, how are you?"
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, what's it about?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I do."
Rachel Green,"I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me."
Rachel Green,"Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!"
Rachel Green,He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Rachel Green,I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,What are you doing here?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up."
Rachel Green,Me too!
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Yeah. Hi Mark!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I did!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God!!
Rachel Green,"Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down."
Rachel Green,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Rachel Green,Tell him.
Rachel Green,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs."
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today."
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Rachel Green,Oh!! I love this job! Wow! My first call.
Rachel Green,Hi honey!
Rachel Green,"Oh, he's just goofing around."
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants."
Rachel Green,Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Rachel Green,"I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!"
Rachel Green,Ow! Ross!!
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm..."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic."
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,All right Ross!! I get it!!
Rachel Green,You're hurt!
Rachel Green,"Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!"
Rachel Green,"Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do."
Rachel Green,Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,"So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?"
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,Hello.
Rachel Green,A big idiot.
Rachel Green,"Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous."
Rachel Green,Where ya going?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, with who?"
Rachel Green,There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
Rachel Green,You have a play date with a stripper?!
Rachel Green,"Sure, is she married?"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?"
Rachel Green,"I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I..."
Rachel Green,"Ugh. Wait, wait, wait."
Rachel Green,"Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, I gotta go to work!"
Rachel Green,Oh I don't know honey. It's gonna be really late.
Rachel Green,"I know. I'm sorry. Look, I'll make a deal with you all right? Okay?"
Rachel Green,For every night that you're asleep before I get home from work...
Rachel Green,I will wake you up in a way that's proved very popular in the past.
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,Somebody got in late last night.
Rachel Green,When did this happen?
Rachel Green,"Monica, what are you doing?"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Do you have any ice?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?"
Rachel Green,"Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?"
Rachel Green,"But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?"
Rachel Green,How often do you read it?
Rachel Green,"Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women."
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Danny just went into room 217."
Rachel Green,"Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!"
Rachel Green,Joey! I can't believe you just did that!
Rachel Green,"All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy."
Rachel Green,Eh. Beth dies.
Rachel Green,Um-hmm.
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,No. She doesn't die.
Rachel Green,"Because, I wanted to hurt you."
Rachel Green,Oh my....
Rachel Green,Sorry. I'm sorry.
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Awwww.
Rachel Green,Joey?
Rachel Green,Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Hi, sweetie!"
Rachel Green,I've got some bad news.
Rachel Green,"I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here."
Rachel Green,"Nooo, he's leaving for a better job."
Rachel Green,Well we're gonna miss you around here.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you bet."
Rachel Green,Funny book?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind."
Rachel Green,"Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark."
Rachel Green,Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Rachel Green,"Because, he's my friend."
Rachel Green,"Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?"
Rachel Green,"I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me."
Rachel Green,Really!?
Rachel Green,"Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Rachel Green,"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'"
Rachel Green,"Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah."
Rachel Green,"Oh, that is so..."
Rachel Green,"Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?"
Rachel Green,"It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life."
Rachel Green,"Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?"
Rachel Green,What?!!
Rachel Green,Hello.
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi."
Rachel Green,"Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night."
Rachel Green,"No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with."
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding."
Rachel Green,"Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?"
Rachel Green,"Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis."
Rachel Green,"Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop."
Rachel Green,"But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!"
Rachel Green,"Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I..."
Rachel Green,None for me.
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!"
Rachel Green,"Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?"
Rachel Green,"Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop."
Rachel Green,I don't have ten minutes!!
Rachel Green,"Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!"
Rachel Green,"Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later."
Rachel Green,Good bye!
Rachel Green,"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
Rachel Green,I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Rachel Green,You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Rachel Green,"But I told you, I didn't have the time!"
Rachel Green,"Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
Rachel Green,Just a job!
Rachel Green,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Rachel Green,Well neither do I!
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break."
Rachel Green,No. A break from us.
Rachel Green,Hello!
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Well, umm....."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Rachel Green,"No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry."
Rachel Green,"Oh. Okay, bye."
Rachel Green,"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break."
Rachel Green,"No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there."
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over."
Rachel Green,Hello.
Rachel Green,"Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called."
Rachel Green,Nobody.
Rachel Green,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
Rachel Green,"Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home."
Rachel Green,You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break."
Rachel Green,No. A break from us.
Rachel Green,"Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break."
Rachel Green,Nobody.
Rachel Green,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Well, we never actually got to dinner."
Rachel Green,"No, we kinda broke up instead."
Rachel Green,"God, Monica it's on the ceiling."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work."
Rachel Green,"Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid."
Rachel Green,"Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine."
Rachel Green,"So, I love you."
Rachel Green,"And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8:30."
Rachel Green,Bye.
Rachel Green,"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
Rachel Green,So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Rachel Green,I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
Rachel Green,Just get away from me!
Rachel Green,A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Rachel Green,"Ross, you had sex with another woman!"
Rachel Green,"Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!"
Rachel Green,Just get out! Now!!
Rachel Green,Okay! All right! How was she?
Rachel Green,Was she good?
Rachel Green,"Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?"
Rachel Green,Good different?
Rachel Green,"Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!"
Rachel Green,And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Rachel Green,We were on a break!
Rachel Green,You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Rachel Green,"Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!"
Rachel Green,God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Rachel Green,"Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again."
Rachel Green,All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Rachel Green,"You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?"
Rachel Green,"You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...."
Rachel Green,"I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza."
Rachel Green,"Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza."
Rachel Green,"With ah, extra anchovies."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?"
Rachel Green,"Well, I should think so. You slept with someone."
Rachel Green,That's....
Rachel Green,That is neither here nor there.
Rachel Green,"No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?"
Rachel Green,I think you should go.
Rachel Green,I really think you need to go now.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, what the hell did I know!"
Rachel Green,"No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever."
Rachel Green,Then how come it is?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee."
Rachel Green,Closer than here?
Rachel Green,"Wait, I'm not just gonna drink somebody's old coffee."
Rachel Green,Is he here?
Rachel Green,Oh. Here's your moisturiser. Hi!
Rachel Green,"You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. Okay, I said that out loud right?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, well okay. Well, there you go."
Rachel Green,Hm-mm.
Rachel Green,Ohh!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's okay."
Rachel Green,And heels.
Rachel Green,"No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that's only fair."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I'm asking you first, right?!. I mean I'm playing by the rules."
Rachel Green,Chandler! You're smoking? What are you doing?!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,No. Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra."
Rachel Green,"No, I stuff outside the bra."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there."
Rachel Green,"What, what's it, what's going on?"
Rachel Green,So you know how to fix it?
Rachel Green,Great!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
Rachel Green,"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!"
Rachel Green,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else."
Rachel Green,"Op, op, car! Car!! Ugh!!!"
Rachel Green,What is he doing here?!
Rachel Green,All right!! Fine! Fine.
Rachel Green,Ask me what?
Rachel Green,You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Rachel Green,Why would you even want to come Ross? You're a horrible skier.
Rachel Green,"All right, let's go!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?"
Rachel Green,Y'know Ross why don't you put that on your answering machine!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Really Joey?
Rachel Green,"No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit."
Rachel Green,"Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since."
Rachel Green,What's your problem?
Rachel Green,"Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City."
Rachel Green,"Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks."
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this."
Rachel Green,Oh my God!! Great!
Rachel Green,"Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men."
Rachel Green,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know."
Rachel Green,I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Rachel Green,"Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker Texas Ranger?"
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,"Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?"
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable."
Rachel Green,We use it!!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, sure, that too."
Rachel Green,Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Rachel Green,Hi!!
Rachel Green,Just one drink?!
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay."
Rachel Green,Wow! Umm....
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no."
Rachel Green,"I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something."
Rachel Green,I don't have any issues with my Father.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Ahh, here's a box of your stuff."
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know, it's just like hats, and a shirt, and CD's, just sort of stuff that you've left here."
Rachel Green,"No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it's time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don't' you think?"
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Good.
Rachel Green,"Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop."
Rachel Green,"Okay, all right, give me the mug! I'll keep the mug."
Rachel Green,You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
Rachel Green,"Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty...."
Rachel Green,Petty...
Rachel Green,Petty...
Rachel Green,Small...
Rachel Green,You are so just doing this out of spite.
Rachel Green,Huh?
Rachel Green,You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn't even fit you anymore!
Rachel Green,yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Rachel Green,"Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'"
Rachel Green,Y'know what?
Rachel Green,I can't do this.
Rachel Green,"Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you."
Rachel Green,Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
Rachel Green,You sure?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
Rachel Green,No. Nothing.
Rachel Green,"Hey, Sophie!"
Rachel Green,"Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here."
Rachel Green,"Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?"
Rachel Green,Summer catalogue!
Rachel Green,"Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna."
Rachel Green,"Bye, Chandler."
Rachel Green,"Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore."
Rachel Green,"No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,I need to talk to you!
Rachel Green,"Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler."
Rachel Green,"Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you..."
Rachel Green,"That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?"
Rachel Green,"Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me."
Rachel Green,Wow!!
Rachel Green,What's this?
Rachel Green,All right!
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,Ooohhhh!!
Rachel Green,Ahhhh!!
Rachel Green,"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
Rachel Green,Hmm.
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I...."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know..."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?"
Rachel Green,"You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'"
Rachel Green,"Well, they always called."
Rachel Green,No. Sorry.
Rachel Green,"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss."
Rachel Green,Well...
Rachel Green,No. I...
Rachel Green,Call her! Call her now!
Rachel Green,"Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!"
Rachel Green,"Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!"
Rachel Green,Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Rachel Green,"I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
Rachel Green,That's fine!
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,Sophie's desk.
Rachel Green,Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Rachel Green,Chandler!!
Rachel Green,"Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now."
Rachel Green,So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Rachel Green,What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Rachel Green,And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,Ow!!
Rachel Green,Got a job on a river boat?
Rachel Green,"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
Rachel Green,"Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, come here!"
Rachel Green,Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Rachel Green,Oww!
Rachel Green,Oww!
Rachel Green,"I'm fine, I'm fine."
Rachel Green,Yes I am!
Rachel Green,"Look, I'm fine. Watch. Look at that. Whoa-whoa!"
Rachel Green,"No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet."
Rachel Green,"Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then."
Rachel Green,"But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
Rachel Green,"Look, either help me or go."
Rachel Green,"Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?"
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?"
Rachel Green,Okay. Let's use this brush.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it."
Rachel Green,Oh-ho!
Rachel Green,Hey! That's just poking me in the eye!
Rachel Green,"Okay, just sweep it."
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,"Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't..."
Rachel Green,"We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle."
Rachel Green,"Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?"
Rachel Green,Blow it.
Rachel Green,Sophisticated like a hooker?
Rachel Green,Sure.
Rachel Green,"Sure, I'll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing."
Rachel Green,"Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around."
Rachel Green,I don't want you to see me naked!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but that was different. Y'know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it's weird."

Rachel Green,Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Rachel Green,Rosss...

Rachel Green,Ow!
Rachel Green,Ow! Ow!
Rachel Green,"Okay, I do."
Rachel Green,I really do.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Thank you. Oww!!!! God!
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you'd tell me the truth. Right?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,What thing? What thing?
Rachel Green,What thing? What is this thing?
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"Ross, why didn't you tell me that?"
Rachel Green,I cannot believe you.
Rachel Green,"That is the sweetest thing, I just...."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry I spoiled you're evening."
Rachel Green,"Um-hmm, yeah."
Rachel Green,See ya.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago."
Rachel Green,What's Flimby's?
Rachel Green,Okay. Hang up! That's it! Come on!
Rachel Green,"No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so..."
Rachel Green,"I meant, me plus one!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, bye-bye!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, I need a date!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi!"
Rachel Green,How are you?
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, looks that way. First ones here! Wooo!!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy."
Rachel Green,"Okay, uhh, I think I'm going to run to the ladies room."
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi!"
Rachel Green,"Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar."
Rachel Green,We're not actors.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,What time is it?
Rachel Green,"Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch."
Rachel Green,You don't?!
Rachel Green,"Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men."
Rachel Green,What's your favourite thing about summertime?
Rachel Green,Yeah...
Rachel Green,"Tommyyyy! Say, what's your favourite thing about summer?"
Rachel Green,"Ross, would you just stop it! It's getting really old."
Rachel Green,Phoe-be!!
Rachel Green,Hey guys! What's...
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Rachel Green,"Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher."
Rachel Green,What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,And?
Rachel Green,"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
Rachel Green,"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
Rachel Green,This place is amazing.
Rachel Green,Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Rachel Green,Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Rachel Green,"Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, ""Look how much money we've got!"" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it."
Rachel Green,"Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!"
Rachel Green,"OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist."
Rachel Green,"Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin."
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,You didn't break up with that fireman?
Rachel Green,Wow!
Rachel Green,How'd it go with Pete?!
Rachel Green,"So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?"
Rachel Green,Why?! What is it?
Rachel Green,Yes!!
Rachel Green,"Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, ah with who?"
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?"
Rachel Green,Oh! That's fine.
Rachel Green,"Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?"
Rachel Green,This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you."
Rachel Green,"Oh, that must be it."
Rachel Green,You said she was bald.
Rachel Green,How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
Rachel Green,"Why, does she have a bad personality?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl."
Rachel Green,Phoebe!
Rachel Green,"Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
Rachel Green,"Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
Rachel Green,You said she was bald!!
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!"
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,"I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I can't watch this."
Rachel Green,I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Rachel Green,That is so cool.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, big, fat bummerrr."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Ross gave it to me.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, thank you."
Rachel Green,"Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!"
Rachel Green,Allll done!
Rachel Green,"Okay, who's next?!"
Rachel Green,"Come on, please?! I'm boredddd! You let me do it once before."
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,Just once!
Rachel Green,"Take it like a man, Ross!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on!"
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah."
Rachel Green,"Okay, your band is playing at Arnold's, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey's boxers!"
Rachel Green,"All right, I'm gonna make more margaritas!"
Rachel Green,I'm just making margaritas.
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on!"
Rachel Green,"Monica, please?"
Rachel Green,"He is, isn't he? I don't know, I don't know, I mean maybe it's just being here at the beach together or, I don't know. But it's like something..."
Rachel Green,Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Rachel Green,"Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, great."
Rachel Green,I'm going for a walk.
Rachel Green,"Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading."
Rachel Green,"Ohhhh, sorry I missed that."
Rachel Green,Ohh-ha-ha!
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald."
Rachel Green,Ohh!
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,I mean you definitely should do that.
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!"
Rachel Green,"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Come on see, she doesn't look that bad."
Rachel Green,I don't know.
Rachel Green,"All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
Rachel Green,Noo.
Rachel Green,"Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!"
Rachel Green,"Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know. Ross, I still can't forgive you for what you did, I can't, I just, but sometimes when I'm with you I just, I feel so..."
Rachel Green,"I just, I feel, I-I just..."
Rachel Green,I feel...
Rachel Green,Well! Good night. I'm going upstairs.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you're welcome a million."
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,Whoa! What?! Why?!
Rachel Green,Here?! Now?!
Rachel Green,"Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?"
Rachel Green,Whoa-ho.
Rachel Green,I don't know.
Rachel Green,"Oh, making it worse!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, was it awful?"
Rachel Green,I wrote you a letter.
Rachel Green,"It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
Rachel Green,"Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done."
Rachel Green,Hey! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Rachel Green,You just finished?
Rachel Green,"So umm, does it?"
Rachel Green,Does it?
Rachel Green,"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it..."
Rachel Green,Are you sure?
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,How was the beach?
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I have to go pack. It really does?"
Rachel Green,"All right, that's it, you guys! What happened out there?"
Rachel Green,Come on!
Rachel Green,"Oh-hooo, I missed you."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?"
Rachel Green,"You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, ""Once a cheater, always a cheater."""
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!"
Rachel Green,What?!!
Rachel Green,You fell asleep?!
Rachel Green,Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!"
Rachel Green,Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Rachel Green,"And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
Rachel Green,"Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep."
Rachel Green,"Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?"
Rachel Green,I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Rachel Green,Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Rachel Green,"Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh."
Rachel Green,Why? I love that thing.
Rachel Green,Something to do with numbers?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Rachel Green,"Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?"
Rachel Green,Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Rachel Green,Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Rachel Green,"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school."
Rachel Green,They had to have that specially made?!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, you go out with him."
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?"
Rachel Green,I believe it.
Rachel Green,"Yes, I do."
Rachel Green,"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
Rachel Green,Jurassic Park could happen.
Rachel Green,"You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?"
Rachel Green,"You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!"
Rachel Green,Do we have to tell her?
Rachel Green,I hate when Ross is right!
Rachel Green,Pheebs...
Rachel Green,All right!!
Rachel Green,Jeez!
Rachel Green,"Hello, Chip."
Rachel Green,"I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself."
Rachel Green,"She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?"
Rachel Green,Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Rachel Green,"So, how was your date?"
Rachel Green,Um-hmm.
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Ohh! That's so great!
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, sweetie."
Rachel Green,You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
Rachel Green,"So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?"
Rachel Green,I'll go with you.
Rachel Green,"Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game."
Rachel Green,"Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?"
Rachel Green,"My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward."
Rachel Green,"You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?"
Rachel Green,What is she doing here?
Rachel Green,"I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'"
Rachel Green,"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it."
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"That's weird, she locked the door."
Rachel Green,"Okay, swear you won't tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office. Do you wanna see the list?"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,You promised you would break up with her!
Rachel Green,And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Rachel Green,"Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! You never see Joanna again!"
Rachel Green,You never come into this office again!
Rachel Green,You give me back my Walkman!
Rachel Green,"Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!"
Rachel Green,Does it hurt?
Rachel Green,Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Rachel Green,"When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!"
Rachel Green,"No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office, I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!"
Rachel Green,"Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why."
Rachel Green,What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Rachel Green,Foot rubs for a month!
Rachel Green,I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Rachel Green,Sophie sit!!
Rachel Green,"No! God, would you just calm down!"
Rachel Green,"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts."
Rachel Green,I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Rachel Green,Yeah!!
Rachel Green,D'oh!! I've got it!
Rachel Green,"I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy."
Rachel Green,I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, not compared to you."
Rachel Green,So did you break up with Joanna?
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,It's me! Good morning!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full."
Rachel Green,"Well, I thought you liked doing it."
Rachel Green,Right!
Rachel Green,"Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger."
Rachel Green,Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
Rachel Green,I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,I didn't... I never said that.
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Rachel Green,"That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed."
Rachel Green,"Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?"
Rachel Green,Oh! My hero! What happened?
Rachel Green,What?! You got us evicted!!
Rachel Green,That's not true!
Rachel Green,Go!!
Rachel Green,"Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that...garbage chute."
Rachel Green,"Hey! So, did you quit?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, umm, I was just y'know working out and umm... Oh, that's it."
Rachel Green,Where?!
Rachel Green,What was that?
Rachel Green,You just did a little dancy thing.
Rachel Green,You are soo enjoying this.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes."
Rachel Green,What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Rachel Green,You got fired?!
Rachel Green,Sweety...
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"May fifth, why?"
Rachel Green,"Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her."
Rachel Green,"Well, have fun!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, she's..."
Rachel Green,You love her.
Rachel Green,"Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross."
Rachel Green,"Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64."
Rachel Green,Okay. I'll miss you.
Rachel Green,"I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum."
Rachel Green,"Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?"
Rachel Green,What was that?
Rachel Green,Oh. Stop it!
Rachel Green,Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
Rachel Green,I think he's stealing from me.
Rachel Green,Because he's stealing from me!
Rachel Green,Ughh!
Rachel Green,Well where's Amanda?
Rachel Green,"I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out."
Rachel Green,"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, that is soo sad."
Rachel Green,"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!"
Rachel Green,Sorry.
Rachel Green,Y'know...
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?"
Rachel Green,Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Rachel Green,"Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!"
Rachel Green,"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey, that's so sweet."
Rachel Green,Oh my God! What happened?
Rachel Green,"Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice."
Rachel Green,"And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love."""
Rachel Green,"No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help."
Rachel Green,"Hey, how'd it go?"
Rachel Green,You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Rachel Green,And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Rachel Green,No....
Rachel Green,Yes! Rent!
Rachel Green,"What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy."
Rachel Green,What did you get her?
Rachel Green,"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?"
Rachel Green,Any luck?
Rachel Green,"All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen."
Rachel Green,"Aw, honey, that's so sweet."
Rachel Green,Oh! Pathetic!
Rachel Green,I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Rachel Green,"Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!"
Rachel Green,Thanks!
Rachel Green,"Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers."
Rachel Green,Why not?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!"
Rachel Green,"I know, I remember that!"
Rachel Green,"Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him."
Rachel Green,Because you do.
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,So are things with you and Joey any better?
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?"
Rachel Green,You shouldn't.
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy."
Rachel Green,"I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just..."
Rachel Green,People are trying to sleep in here!
Rachel Green,"Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye."
Rachel Green,"I know, it's sick."
Rachel Green,Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Rachel Green,Is he okay in there?
Rachel Green,"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?"
Rachel Green,Why?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Rachel Green,"Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed."
Rachel Green,Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Rachel Green,Credit.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I like those sunglasses."
Rachel Green,
Rachel Green,Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
Rachel Green,Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Rachel Green,"Ross, can you pass me the yams?"
Rachel Green,Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Rachel Green,"Okay, fine."
Rachel Green,"Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!"
Rachel Green,"Joey, had reasons."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, he sees her!"
Rachel Green,No?
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss..."
Rachel Green,"Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and..."
Rachel Green,"God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying."
Rachel Green,And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Rachel Green,Ohh! That's great!
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,"Well, I, umm..."
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
Rachel Green,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
Rachel Green,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
Rachel Green,"Yes, I realize that..."
Rachel Green,I love working with designers!
Rachel Green,"Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview."
Rachel Green,"No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you."
Rachel Green,There's nobody here!
Rachel Green,Do you want me to quit?
Rachel Green,"Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,My drinking?
Rachel Green,Said what? Exactly.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!"
Rachel Green,Say more things like that.
Rachel Green,I'd need an expense account.
Rachel Green,And an assistant.
Rachel Green,"Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, you've waited soo long."
Rachel Green,"Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya."
Rachel Green,How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
Rachel Green,Yes!!!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!"
Rachel Green,I'm an assistant buyer!!
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?"
Rachel Green,Heard what?
Rachel Green,Oh my God! How?!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God."
Rachel Green,"Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened."
Rachel Green,"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna..."
Rachel Green,"Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great."
Rachel Green,"Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?"
Rachel Green,"Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs."
Rachel Green,"Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!"
Rachel Green,"Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?"
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, that's great!"
Rachel Green,"But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle."
Rachel Green,Oh yeah!
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,"So, will I like any of these guys?"
Rachel Green,Chandler!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I like swimmer's bodies!"
Rachel Green,"Op, I like credit cards!"
Rachel Green,"Well, so what does he do?"
Rachel Green,Your company has a fine foods division?
Rachel Green,Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Rachel Green,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?"
Rachel Green,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Rachel Green,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea."
Rachel Green,"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?"
Rachel Green,You idiot!!
Rachel Green,You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Rachel Green,"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Rachel Green,Well that sounds fun too.
Rachel Green,"What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!"
Rachel Green,But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Rachel Green,"Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about."
Rachel Green,Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a...keeper.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom?"
Rachel Green,You guys are really right...there aren't you?
Rachel Green,"Oh, Chandler that is so nice."
Rachel Green,Why? Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you should, really."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that."
Rachel Green,"Let me see that. Oh, yeah."
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, sometimes that helps."
Rachel Green,"Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn."
Rachel Green,"Oo, toes!! Well, for some people."
Rachel Green,"Oo, I can't watch this, it's like Sophie's Choice."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, it was only okay."
Rachel Green,It depends on who asked.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Mon, sure."
Rachel Green,Yes. You're not asking are you?
Rachel Green,Yes! Totally!
Rachel Green,What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Rachel Green,"BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!"
Rachel Green,What is that noise?
Rachel Green,"Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster."
Rachel Green,Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around...
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Rachel Green,How many guesses do you get?
Rachel Green,No! There's no orange juice in there! We win!!
Rachel Green,"Okay, well, we won that one."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions."
Rachel Green,Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
Rachel Green,"I know! I know, it's such a huge, life-altering thing."
Rachel Green,Tails!
Rachel Green,We'll take Literature!!
Rachel Green,Chandler gets it! It's Chandler Bing!
Rachel Green,It's All Relative!!
Rachel Green,I'm sorry!
Rachel Green,"Monica, I don't want to lose 200 dollars."
Rachel Green,Monica?!
Rachel Green,"Okay, so let's play for some pepper! Stop spending my money!"
Rachel Green,Oooohh that's interesting.
Rachel Green,Throw in the duck too!
Rachel Green,"Well, he gets the other one all riled up."
Rachel Green,"Monica, betting the apartment, I don't know about this."
Rachel Green,Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
Rachel Green,"All right, let's do it."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,All right!
Rachel Green,14?
Rachel Green,Space cowboy!
Rachel Green,"Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers."
Rachel Green,He carries a briefcase.
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,Oh my God! I can't believe you guys are actually think you're moving in here!
Rachel Green,Well I-I-I'm not moving.
Rachel Green,"No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!"
Rachel Green,Noooo.
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"I don't care, I'm not going anywhere."
Rachel Green,"No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl's apartment! That is a boy's apartment, it's dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It's-it's so pretty! And look, and it's-it's purple! And I'm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand."
Rachel Green,That's right! You do what the hand says!
Rachel Green,How did it go?
Rachel Green,"Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!"
Rachel Green,That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Rachel Green,"Well it stupid, unfair question!"
Rachel Green,Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Rachel Green,No it's not!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I think I saw some in here."
Rachel Green,"I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die."
Rachel Green,Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Rachel Green,"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!"
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Rachel Green,"Well, at least that's a great suit."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry."
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way."
Rachel Green,"I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh."
Rachel Green,Hi-e!!
Rachel Green,"Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there."
Rachel Green,It's Joshua.
Rachel Green,"Why? Honey, what is the big deal?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, that's true."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, what did she say?"
Rachel Green,Beefsteak Charlie's?
Rachel Green,"Whoops. Oh, hey, do you need help with that?"
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It's just so frustrating!"
Rachel Green,Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Rachel Green,Hmm-mmm.
Rachel Green,"Yeah but, I've never asked a guy out before."
Rachel Green,No. Have you?
Rachel Green,I don't even know how I would go about it.
Rachel Green,"You know what, I'm gonna do that, I'm gonna call him up, and I'm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. How you doin'? Hi! Joshua? It's Rachel Green from Bloomingdale's. Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we- the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let's see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. You've done that a thousand times?"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no."
Rachel Green,Really?! You think that will work?
Rachel Green,"Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!"
Rachel Green,"Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?"
Rachel Green,Great.
Rachel Green,Sure.
Rachel Green,Yeah-eah-ha!
Rachel Green,"Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Basketball!
Rachel Green,"I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket."
Rachel Green,"He didn't turn me down! He's at the game isn't he? I got the date, I'm just not on it!"
Rachel Green,Wow! Monica!
Rachel Green,"Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Yes! I will! Absolutely! Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I'm glad. Rachel, I'd like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin'?"
Rachel Green,How does going to a strip club help him better?
Rachel Green,Um-hmm. There we go. There it is.
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay. Uhh, well let's see. You're about-well uh, this one is large. And this one-"
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!"
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,Sure. You got it. Great!
Rachel Green,"Me, Fledermaus, great. I really-"
Rachel Green,So?
Rachel Green,"Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I'll be right back!"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,No! Nothing!
Rachel Green,Yeah! That would be great!
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I guess-I..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, great, you betcha!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh. Oh, right."
Rachel Green,Oh yay!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Hey, Monica!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, it's Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But, I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So... What are you gonna do?"
Rachel Green,No! Help me!
Rachel Green,Phoebe?
Rachel Green,Ugh!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this is-I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y'know the ""Wouldn't it be great if she was my wife"" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?"
Rachel Green,Ohh! Hi!
Rachel Green,So....
Rachel Green,"Ohhhh, come on!!!"
Rachel Green,"No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross, please!"
Rachel Green,"I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we've gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?"
Rachel Green,"Oh thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Emily?"
Rachel Green,I'm Rachel Green.
Rachel Green,There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So...
Rachel Green,"Oh well, no I..."
Rachel Green,I'll get her.
Rachel Green,"Hey-whoa, slow down. No, keep moving. Wow!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I didn't see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face."
Rachel Green,"The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep."
Rachel Green,"No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!"" and he let her right in."
Rachel Green,"No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can't believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me."
Rachel Green,"Honey, that's you're name."
Rachel Green,What? Who the hell is Emily- noooo!!
Rachel Green,They're in Vermont!! How could this happen?!
Rachel Green,How-how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!
Rachel Green,I don't get this! She was horrible!
Rachel Green,"I don't care! All right, y'know what I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua that-y'know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know, would you just for once, not remember every...little...thing!!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
Rachel Green,I can't believe it! He still hasn't called.
Rachel Green,It's Joshua.
Rachel Green,"No, I don't."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, come on! What's going in on in there?"
Rachel Green,"See, I don't know, for me it would have to Chantal."
Rachel Green,"Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh..."
Rachel Green,"Well, are we all together? Like in a group?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, hey!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, hmm."
Rachel Green,Joshua.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank goodness!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help. Happy for you."
Rachel Green,"No, happy for you!"
Rachel Green,"No-no-no, that' not Joshua."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, there's a guy right over there."
Rachel Green,"Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off."
Rachel Green,Hmm.
Rachel Green,"Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?"
Rachel Green,Guess who we ran into today?!
Rachel Green,You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light."
Rachel Green,It's coming from Joey!
Rachel Green,"Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad."
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him."
Rachel Green,"You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?"
Rachel Green,No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Rachel Green,What are these?
Rachel Green,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
Rachel Green,Wow! If only more people knew.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,What-what are-what are these?
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Look at this!
Rachel Green,I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Rachel Green,And did you?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus."
Rachel Green,Thank God.
Rachel Green,"Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket."
Rachel Green,"Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted."
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store."
Rachel Green,"Well, that's because of a lot of..."
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,Oh?
Rachel Green,"Well, congratulations, so do you love her?"
Rachel Green,"Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's just an anti-theft device."
Rachel Green,"You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up."
Rachel Green,"Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans."
Rachel Green,"We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!"
Rachel Green,Surprise!!!
Rachel Green,"Well, it was all Ross's idea."
Rachel Green,"Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny."
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!"
Rachel Green,Care for a cherry?
Rachel Green,"No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue."
Rachel Green,"Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?"
Rachel Green,Up!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,It's not Christmas!
Rachel Green,He's not 11!
Rachel Green,What? You're leaving?!
Rachel Green,"No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!"
Rachel Green,"So, Spin The Bottle works like this I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther's face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?"
Rachel Green,Yay! Emily!
Rachel Green,"Okay, my turn!!"
Rachel Green,"It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!"
Rachel Green,"All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting."
Rachel Green,Just a bug.
Rachel Green,"No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'"
Rachel Green,Gimme an 'M!'
Rachel Green,Gimme an 'I!'
Rachel Green,Gimme an 'L!'
Rachel Green,Gimme a 'Y!'
Rachel Green,What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
Rachel Green,"I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?"
Rachel Green,"All right, come on, let's go get your coat."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?"
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control."
Rachel Green,"Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen."
Rachel Green,"Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you."
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!"
Rachel Green,Why?!
Rachel Green,You like me?
Rachel Green,"Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!"
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you."
Rachel Green,"Oh, now see that's a fancy but."
Rachel Green,But....
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening."
Rachel Green,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself."
Rachel Green,Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Rachel Green,I'm so sorry.
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?"
Rachel Green,You seem to really like her.
Rachel Green,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"You're a pathetic loser, right?"
Rachel Green,Sit!
Rachel Green,"Oh my gosh, Joshua!"
Rachel Green,They're not true?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Oh! Oh, I love that but."
Rachel Green,You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Rachel Green,Okay. Every time.
Rachel Green,"All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy."
Rachel Green,"Give it here. Oh, God."
Rachel Green,Is that the heartbeat?
Rachel Green,Oh wow! This is so cool.
Rachel Green,"Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!"
Rachel Green,What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Rachel Green,Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Rachel Green,"No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination."
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,"I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?"
Rachel Green,"Well, what-what 'cha got there?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised..."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Relaxi-Taxi!
Rachel Green,"Well, well I can up with it!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I..."
Rachel Green,"Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab."
Rachel Green,"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing."
Rachel Green,Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Rachel Green,What am I making him by the way?
Rachel Green,I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Rachel Green,"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. Ahh. So, dig in!"
Rachel Green,Hmmm!
Rachel Green,"Oh I know, my God, this is so-this rice is so-I am so good."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure, okay. Okay."
Rachel Green,"All gone! So, farm birds, huh?"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Okay. So, can I serve you a little of-What? What? What?"
Rachel Green,"But, they're across the hall! I mean that's two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here."
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment."
Rachel Green,Your parents'?
Rachel Green,Ohh.
Rachel Green,Yeah that works.
Rachel Green,Wow! This place is fabulous!
Rachel Green,"Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?"
Rachel Green,"That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?"
Rachel Green,Ah.
Rachel Green,Hi you!
Rachel Green,"I know, I can do more than cook."
Rachel Green,Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Rachel Green,Hello.
Rachel Green,"What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, ""USA not ready."""
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,"Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house."
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out."
Rachel Green,"No, it's all right. I got nice boobs."
Rachel Green,So?
Rachel Green,Huh.
Rachel Green,"She's totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on."
Rachel Green,Absolutely! Absolutely!
Rachel Green,"What-yeah-what, y'know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian."
Rachel Green,HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Rachel Green,I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Rachel Green,Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Rachel Green,"Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!"
Rachel Green,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"So-Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Do you guys want these?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, well you got 'em."
Rachel Green,Just give us our apartment back!
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on! We know what these are worth."
Rachel Green,You're bachelor pad?!
Rachel Green,"Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua."
Rachel Green,"All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?"
Rachel Green,Let me finish.
Rachel Green,"I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all."
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty."
Rachel Green,What? Shut up! We're winning!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again."
Rachel Green,Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!
Rachel Green,We took our apartment back!!
Rachel Green,"All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer."
Rachel Green,Let us keep the apartment and...
Rachel Green,Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!"
Rachel Green,Oh! It's you. Hi.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so..."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I'm okay."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's sweet."
Rachel Green,"Uhh, hang in there?"
Rachel Green,I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Rachel Green,"Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has-yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates."
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y'know, emotionally, mentally, physically..."
Rachel Green,I know isn't it? It's like I'm right there with Joshua.
Rachel Green,"You are right there with Emily. And it's y'know, it's kinda like.... it's a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes."
Rachel Green,Oh yeah? Fine.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, no, what's that?"
Rachel Green,That would be great!
Rachel Green,Hang in there. You hang in there.
Rachel Green,"No, just singing."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!"
Rachel Green,"Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's."
Rachel Green,Why not?
Rachel Green,Nothing.
Rachel Green,In a month?
Rachel Green,"You mean, you mean 30 days?"
Rachel Green,From now?
Rachel Green,"Well, that's great."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you. See you."
Rachel Green,Yeah! Sit!
Rachel Green,"I'm more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?"
Rachel Green,"'Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y'know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y'know?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!"
Rachel Green,"Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ......I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, ""Whoa! Can we do this?"" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?"
Rachel Green,"Well, I just called Joshua..."
Rachel Green,"Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time."
Rachel Green,"Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well."
Rachel Green,And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Rachel Green,"Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three."
Rachel Green,Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
Rachel Green,"Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me."
Rachel Green,"Well, apparently he scares easy."
Rachel Green,"It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would."
Rachel Green,"Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Yeah! I got my girls.
Rachel Green,Ugh.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood."
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay!"
Rachel Green,I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
Rachel Green,"Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo."
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it."
Rachel Green,"Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
Rachel Green,"Hi, sure!"
Rachel Green,I knew.
Rachel Green,I did.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, maybe..."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, you're so great."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Ohhh!!!!
Rachel Green,"Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!"
Rachel Green,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
Rachel Green,Yes! Did you see that?
Rachel Green,I could not have done this without you.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
Rachel Green,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
Rachel Green,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Rachel Green,Good.
Rachel Green,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Rachel Green,Well neither do I!
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break."
Rachel Green,No. A break from us.
Rachel Green,"Hi. Ohhh, you got my message."
Rachel Green,So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Rachel Green,"Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!"
Rachel Green,Just get out! Now!!
Rachel Green,Okay! All right! How was she?
Rachel Green,Was she good?
Rachel Green,"Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?"
Rachel Green,Good different?
Rachel Green,"...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, ""Once a cheater, always a cheater."" Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
Rachel Green,You seem to really like her.
Rachel Green,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Hey guys! What's up?
Rachel Green,What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
Rachel Green,"Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey, I don't know. I..."
Rachel Green,"No, I'll think about it. Yeah."
Rachel Green,Who's this from?
Rachel Green,Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Rachel Green,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
Rachel Green,What did you just say?
Rachel Green,Oh.... my God.
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
Rachel Green,She didn't hang up either...
Rachel Green,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . ."
Rachel Green,Ohhhhhhhh God.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, ohh."
Rachel Green,"Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Oh, god."
Rachel Green,"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
Rachel Green,"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
Rachel Green,Noo.
Rachel Green,"Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know."
Rachel Green,"I just, I feel, I-I just..."
Rachel Green,Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Rachel Green,"And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late."
Rachel Green,"Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour."
Rachel Green,"I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in."
Rachel Green,"So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"
Rachel Green,"Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?"
Rachel Green,Hormones!
Rachel Green,Nooo!
Rachel Green,All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.
Rachel Green,Well umm...
Rachel Green,Little village people.
Rachel Green,"Oh, that is so sweet!"
Rachel Green,"Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them."
Rachel Green,Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Rachel Green,"Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!"
Rachel Green,Hi! Phoebe.
Rachel Green,No we...
Rachel Green,"...hormones, yeah."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding."
Rachel Green,"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that..."
Rachel Green,"Well, h-how is this like that?"
Rachel Green,"I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that..."
Rachel Green,Good.
Rachel Green,What?! She made the tea!
Rachel Green,You what?
Rachel Green,"Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!"
Rachel Green,Okay! Okay! Here!
Rachel Green,I don't know!
Rachel Green,I still don't get how you know when it's false labour.
Rachel Green,"Well, isn't that a good thing? You said you were sick of this."
Rachel Green,"No, really. Really, Pheebs, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they're bad, y'know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down. Y'know?"
Rachel Green,And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Rachel Green,"And y'know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you."
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Who are you saying ""check"" too?"
Rachel Green,Have fun!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't."
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?"
Rachel Green,Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Rachel Green,"Okay, that is all you."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat."
Rachel Green,I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Rachel Green,Still in love with?!
Rachel Green,I'm not in love with Ross!
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!"
Rachel Green,We?!
Rachel Green,You all know? Does Ross know?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Rachel Green,You can?
Rachel Green,Um-hmm.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?"
Rachel Green,I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Rachel Green,"I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Ow!
Rachel Green,"Well, I like you less!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too."
Rachel Green,Pheebs?
Rachel Green,Do you remember where the duck food is?
Rachel Green,Because I'm going to London.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, that didn't work."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
Rachel Green,Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, ""I do."""
Rachel Green,"Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi."
Rachel Green,"Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, good."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you."
Rachel Green,Huh.. How about 600?
Rachel Green,How about 600 and these earrings?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty."
Rachel Green,"Hi, Pheebs."
Rachel Green,"Bye, Pheebs."
Rachel Green,"Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to..."
Rachel Green,Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Rachel Green,"Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up."
Rachel Green,"Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the ""engine""."
Rachel Green,"Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!"
Rachel Green,"All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!!"
Rachel Green,Ohhh.
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Oh. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry. It's just, I'm ahh, I'm kinda excited. I'm, ahh, going to London to ahh, tell this guy that I love him and..."
Rachel Green,"...And so then I realised. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. Was all just a way of..."
Rachel Green,"Ehh, pardon me?"
Rachel Green,But he has to know how I feel!
Rachel Green,Well I-I think your wrong.
Rachel Green,"Well, he doesn't really love her. I mean, it's just a rebound thing from me.... You'll see!"
Rachel Green,Well I just came... I just needed to tell you... Congratulations.
Rachel Green,"He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?"
Rachel Green,"Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something."
Rachel Green,"Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?"
Rachel Green,"Monica, what should I do?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me."
Rachel Green,Yes?
Rachel Green,"Oh, you know what? Rachel.. She just left."
Rachel Green,Ra.... Er.. Barbra.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi!"
Rachel Green,"Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, ""I take thee circus freak."" Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?"
Rachel Green,Right...
Rachel Green,"Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame."
Rachel Green,"Get the hell out of there, y'know?"
Rachel Green,"Well, look at that, same thing."
Rachel Green,Ross said my name. Okay? My name.
Rachel Green,"If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!"
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well, Ross said my name."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then..."
Rachel Green,"Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside..."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?"
Rachel Green,"So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?"
Rachel Green,Yeah. I'm sorry.
Rachel Green,"No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love."
Rachel Green,"No, you know what, I think you should go."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good."
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Good!
Rachel Green,Right!
Rachel Green,Right!
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here."
Rachel Green,"What? Wait, what?"
Rachel Green,"Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?"
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!"
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,All right!
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah."
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait-wait-wait..."
Rachel Green,Okay. Wait! Wait!
Rachel Green,"Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot"
Rachel Green,"And uh, he will have a white wine spritzer."
Rachel Green,"All right. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? They said they were gonna wait! Miss? Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my... Ross, you better be under the wheels of this thing!!"
Rachel Green,"He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?"
Rachel Green,"Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something."
Rachel Green,"Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?"
Rachel Green,"Monica, what should I do?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me."
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi!"
Rachel Green,"Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, ""I take thee circus freak."" Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake.

Rachel Green,"Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Good!
Rachel Green,Right!
Rachel Green,Right!
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here."
Rachel Green,"What? Wait, what?"
Rachel Green,"Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?"
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!"
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,All right!
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay, we're going. Yeah."
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait-wait-wait..."
Rachel Green,Okay. Wait! Wait!
Rachel Green,"Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh, he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo! Hey, look at that, the airport's moving. Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we're moving? Oh my God. Oh, my gosh."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do."
Rachel Green,"Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel."
Rachel Green,"Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, you're the best."
Rachel Green,"What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions."
Rachel Green,"Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London."
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me."
Rachel Green,"That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it."
Rachel Green,"I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it ..."
Rachel Green,...I mean it's my fault.
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I don't know. I don't know."
Rachel Green,"All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night."
Rachel Green,Well...
Rachel Green,That's not European!
Rachel Green,"Oh God, I really had a good time!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second."
Rachel Green,"Umm, hi!"
Rachel Green,Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Rachel Green,What's that?
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey that's awful."
Rachel Green,"But, it's not raining."
Rachel Green,"Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!"
Rachel Green,"Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Rachel Green,"Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him."
Rachel Green,Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired."
Rachel Green,Well...
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Well, then talk!"
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,I'm gonna do it.
Rachel Green,But I...
Rachel Green,"All right, fine."
Rachel Green,"Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, woo!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute."
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I-I don't care."
Rachel Green,What 'cha readin'?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, what's it about?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross."
Rachel Green,I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Rachel Green,"Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, ""You are such an idiot!"""
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, that's not funny."
Rachel Green,"Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?"
Rachel Green,"The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily."
Rachel Green,"Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?"
Rachel Green,That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Rachel Green,"High-five, the babies are coming!"
Rachel Green,I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Rachel Green,You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Rachel Green,"Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming."
Rachel Green,"Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful."
Rachel Green,Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Rachel Green,They're male nurses.
Rachel Green,"Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?"
Rachel Green,"What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them."
Rachel Green,"Joey, how do you make that dirty?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice."
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!"
Rachel Green,"Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane."
Rachel Green,Me?!
Rachel Green,No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Rachel Green,"No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet."
Rachel Green,Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Monica, this is Dan , one of the guys that we're gonna be going out with on Saturday. Uh Dan, Monica."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time."
Rachel Green,"Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, fair enough."
Rachel Green,"Oh, how does he look? How does he look?"
Rachel Green,"Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, umm, no honey."
Rachel Green,So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Rachel Green,Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!"
Rachel Green,"That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?"
Rachel Green,"Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him."
Rachel Green,Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Rachel Green,"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?"
Rachel Green,"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?"
Rachel Green,I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Rachel Green,What-what-what are you gonna do?
Rachel Green,Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Rachel Green,Chandler! Is he?
Rachel Green,Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Rachel Green,For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Rachel Green,"Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!"
Rachel Green,Like what?
Rachel Green,"Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help."
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!"
Rachel Green,"Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!"
Rachel Green,"Hi, guys!"
Rachel Green,What's going on?
Rachel Green,"Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?"
Rachel Green,Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah! I know.
Rachel Green,Oh my God! My dog died!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!"
Rachel Green,"Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God."
Rachel Green,It's Le Poo.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah!
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?"
Rachel Green,Sorry. Sorry.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Okay, what's up?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants."
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?"
Rachel Green,"Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!"
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you."
Rachel Green,Storming out!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?"
Rachel Green,That's not Ross!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip."
Rachel Green,Do you even know who Kip is?
Rachel Green,"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!"
Rachel Green,"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go."
Rachel Green,"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out."
Rachel Green,Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
Rachel Green,"Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones."
Rachel Green,Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross..."
Rachel Green,"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you."
Rachel Green,"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!"
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,I know that too.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it's in there."
Rachel Green,Uh-huh!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?"
Rachel Green,I want the little round waffles.
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!"
Rachel Green,Arghhhh!!!!!!
Rachel Green,You guys! You guys!
Rachel Green,"It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!"
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Rachel Green,"Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it."
Rachel Green,Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!"
Rachel Green,"What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
Rachel Green,"Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Rachel Green,"So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!"
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants."
Rachel Green,And stop saying that! I hate that!
Rachel Green,Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Okay. Okay.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny."
Rachel Green,That yeti is one smooth talker.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room."
Rachel Green,"Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind."
Rachel Green,"Ross, I..."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down."
Rachel Green,I haven't seen him in so long!
Rachel Green,"Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?"
Rachel Green,Thank you. Mon?
Rachel Green,How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced."
Rachel Green,"I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing."
Rachel Green,Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, great!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out."
Rachel Green,"That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?"
Rachel Green,"No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?"
Rachel Green,Exactly.
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi Danny."
Rachel Green,"Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala."
Rachel Green,"It's a uh, regatta gala."
Rachel Green,"No-no, but I support it."
Rachel Green,Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, ""No!"" Which puts me right back in the driver seat."
Rachel Green,Ball? There is no ball.
Rachel Green,Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Rachel Green,What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Rachel Green,"Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!"
Rachel Green,"No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy."
Rachel Green,"Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party."
Rachel Green,"Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure. All right, whose court is the ball in now?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, go on! You telling people about me?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, okay, at ease solider!"
Rachel Green,"No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. You tell him, ""Nice try."""
Rachel Green,Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?"
Rachel Green,I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Rachel Green,What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Rachel Green,Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Rachel Green,"Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over..."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!"
Rachel Green,Happy Thanksgiving!
Rachel Green,"Oh! No, not really."
Rachel Green,Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!"
Rachel Green,Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,"Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know."
Rachel Green,"I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!"
Rachel Green,"Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about."
Rachel Green,"No, it wasn't. It was actually the..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building."
Rachel Green,Oh hi!
Rachel Green,"No, God! Please, let me!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Okay, that we may be able to do."
Rachel Green,Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Rachel Green,"Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Then, you will definitely get him back!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on."
Rachel Green,"Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him."
Rachel Green,"Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?"
Rachel Green,You brought a carrot?!
Rachel Green,All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Rachel Green,"Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?"
Rachel Green,"Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear."
Rachel Green,"Hey, Pheebs!"
Rachel Green,What are you reading?
Rachel Green,Honey that sounds like fun.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I read that in high school."
Rachel Green,"Sorry I'm late, but I left late."
Rachel Green,"So Pheebs, what is the book about?"
Rachel Green,"Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-umm, what is this book about?"
Rachel Green,"Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story."
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character."
Rachel Green,"Well, honey that was pretty obvious."
Rachel Green,"Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!"
Rachel Green,"Joey, is what she just said umm-Oh my God. You were actually gonna..."
Rachel Green,"And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"So umm, what's this book about?"
Rachel Green,"Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else."
Rachel Green,"Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman."
Rachel Green,Come on Phoebe! Don't be such a goodie-goodie!
Rachel Green,A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Rachel Green,"Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!"
Rachel Green,That was not funny!
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh. Oh, so you really wanted to learn. Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh, you know who you should go with?"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Rachel Green,"You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!"
Rachel Green,Joey has got a secret peephole!
Rachel Green,Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Rachel Green,Look!
Rachel Green,"Well, what is the truth?"
Rachel Green,"Monica, is this true?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?"
Rachel Green,And the video camera?
Rachel Green,"Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is."
Rachel Green,"Thanks, Mon."
Rachel Green,Monica!!!
Rachel Green,Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
Rachel Green,I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Rachel Green,"Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!"
Rachel Green,"No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!"
Rachel Green,"She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan."
Rachel Green,So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Rachel Green,You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Uh, it was very nice meeting you."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?"
Rachel Green,"Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?"
Rachel Green,"Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks."
Rachel Green,"Oh, great!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, see? I told you!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it."
Rachel Green,"Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and..."
Rachel Green,"Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's..."
Rachel Green,"No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy."
Rachel Green,"No-no, they're not very nice people."
Rachel Green,"Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, okay, I'll see you later."
Rachel Green,"I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!"
Rachel Green,I'm not reading this!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,So?
Rachel Green,"Oh, good point."
Rachel Green,"Happy New Year, Joey!"
Rachel Green,But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Rachel Green,"Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about."
Rachel Green,I don't gossip!
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?"
Rachel Green,What? They were like this!
Rachel Green,"I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it."
Rachel Green,I think they're very nice.
Rachel Green,"Awful, absolutely awful."
Rachel Green,"""Baddest man in the whole damn town."""
Rachel Green,Arghh!!
Rachel Green,"Joey, do you have a minute?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone."
Rachel Green,"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!"
Rachel Green,What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Rachel Green,"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone..."
Rachel Green,That really is something; that's really cool.
Rachel Green,"Good luck, honey!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, uh, Joey?"
Rachel Green,Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Rachel Green,"I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?"
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Do you know something?
Rachel Green,I might know something too.
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know."
Rachel Green,Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Rachel Green,"All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!"
Rachel Green,AND YOU KNOW!!!
Rachel Green,"Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?"
Rachel Green,"Ohhh, yeah, me too."
Rachel Green,Come on Joey!!!
Rachel Green,I can't believe you would say that!
Rachel Green,"No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?"
Rachel Green,Is he romantic with her?
Rachel Green,Are they in love?
Rachel Green,You don't know anything.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I don't think anyone's mad about that."
Rachel Green,"Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,What's up?!
Rachel Green,"Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?"
Rachel Green,"Oh y'know what, we don't have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!"
Rachel Green,Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Rachel Green,Nothing! You go!
Rachel Green,"Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm, y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if-are you sure there's just not anything else?"
Rachel Green,No! If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Rachel Green,Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Rachel Green,There he is!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, out, oh God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there!"
Rachel Green,You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Rachel Green,Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Rachel Green,Ross! Janice?!
Rachel Green,"Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!"
Rachel Green,"Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler."
Rachel Green,"I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said, ""Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"" And you said, ""No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."""
Rachel Green,"Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Rachel Green,Sure! Why?
Rachel Green,What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Rachel Green,Hey! Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well, I was actually-I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better."
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Rachel Green,"That's good enough. Right? Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,'Kay. Congratulations on your new job.
Rachel Green,"Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out."
Rachel Green,"Sure! God, please take those off!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?"
Rachel Green,"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay."
Rachel Green,It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Rachel Green,"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag."
Rachel Green,Exactly! Unisex!
Rachel Green,No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Rachel Green,"Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow."
Rachel Green,"Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it."
Rachel Green,"All right, then you owe me $350."
Rachel Green,Joey...
Rachel Green,"Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy."
Rachel Green,Hi sweetie!
Rachel Green,Why?! Why not?!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?"
Rachel Green,What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Rachel Green,"Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it..."
Rachel Green,...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial."
Rachel Green,I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt."
Rachel Green,Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Rachel Green,"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,OH MY GOD!!!
Rachel Green,Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Rachel Green,I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Rachel Green,"Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!"
Rachel Green,HI!! Hi!
Rachel Green,"Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!"
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it."
Rachel Green,Joey! Come here! Come here!
Rachel Green,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Rachel Green,"No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window."
Rachel Green,Wh-what do you mean?
Rachel Green,"Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!"
Rachel Green,"Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing."
Rachel Green,You don't have any secrets!
Rachel Green,"So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Okay great, hold on a sec! Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!"
Rachel Green,Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Rachel Green,"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!"
Rachel Green,Y'know what you should do?
Rachel Green,"You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear."
Rachel Green,See?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, he broke those too."
Rachel Green,Hello! Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here! It's Chandler.
Rachel Green,Are you kidding?!
Rachel Green,"I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?"
Rachel Green,Joey!
Rachel Green,"Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!"
Rachel Green,All right. Be sexy.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah! Oh my God! That is our friend! It's Naked Ross!
Rachel Green,Show time!
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,"Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!"
Rachel Green,"Okay? Whoa, wait!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, oh wait!"
Rachel Green,"Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open."
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,"Hey, what's-what's going on?!"
Rachel Green,"Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while."
Rachel Green,"Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react."
Rachel Green,"Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Rachel Green,"Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?"
Rachel Green,"Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that."
Rachel Green,"Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you."
Rachel Green,And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Rachel Green,"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head."
Rachel Green,"Well, because she loves you and because you love her."
Rachel Green,"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica."
Rachel Green,"No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different."
Rachel Green,Not unless different means the same.
Rachel Green,"Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big."
Rachel Green,"Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why."
Rachel Green,"Hey! Hey, cute jacket!"
Rachel Green,Oh! Ow!
Rachel Green,Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, you're so sweet!"
Rachel Green,"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!"
Rachel Green,"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?"
Rachel Green,"Uhh, we still need a tip."
Rachel Green,A couple of bucks.
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge."
Rachel Green,Hey Joey!
Rachel Green,Ugh!
Rachel Green,What?! You say that to kids?!!
Rachel Green,"Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch."
Rachel Green,"Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!"
Rachel Green,Yeah! Are you kiddin'?
Rachel Green,Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,"Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch."
Rachel Green,Fine! We went out.
Rachel Green,Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Rachel Green,"Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Oh-oh!
Rachel Green,Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Rachel Green,"Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?"
Rachel Green,What's up Joey?
Rachel Green,"Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?"
Rachel Green,Thanks!
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,What's up Joe?
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,What are you saying?
Rachel Green,"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait."
Rachel Green,Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Rachel Green,"Well, I brought the next best thing."
Rachel Green,"Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?"
Rachel Green,Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,"Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit."
Rachel Green,"I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!"
Rachel Green,Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Rachel Green,What?! Why?!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!"
Rachel Green,"Good, you guys are all here!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!"
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,Wh-what?!
Rachel Green,"Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,O-okay!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!"
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,"Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!"" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!"
Rachel Green,"All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh..."
Rachel Green,"Well, I didn't know what else to do!"
Rachel Green,Thanks Chandler.
Rachel Green,I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Rachel Green,"What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?"
Rachel Green,"I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"""
Rachel Green,Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Rachel Green,"Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Excuse me?
Rachel Green,"Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!"
Rachel Green,Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Rachel Green,Oh. Ohhhhhhhhh....
Rachel Green,"Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you."
Rachel Green,"Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr..."
Rachel Green,"Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it."
Rachel Green,Oh! You are?
Rachel Green,"Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!"
Rachel Green,I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine."
Rachel Green,"Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!"
Rachel Green,"Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day..."
Rachel Green,"Okay guys, way to wish me luck!"
Rachel Green,"Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry."
Rachel Green,"Oh, what a fun office."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke."
Rachel Green,...and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Rachel Green,"I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!"
Rachel Green,"I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I can do that."
Rachel Green,I would love to!
Rachel Green,"Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air."
Rachel Green,Oh great!
Rachel Green,Oh that's okay.
Rachel Green,"Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, ""Wow, those guys are crazy!"" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time."
Rachel Green,"Oh, me too."
Rachel Green,"Oh, me too."
Rachel Green,"Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions."
Rachel Green,Thanks!
Rachel Green,Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Rachel Green,I did not!
Rachel Green,"All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!"
Rachel Green,"No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up."
Rachel Green,I am so on board!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach."
Rachel Green,Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Rachel Green,Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Rachel Green,Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
Rachel Green,Okay then!
Rachel Green,Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Rachel Green,Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Rachel Green,"Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?"
Rachel Green,"Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Oh man!
Rachel Green,What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Rachel Green,Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay, not so weird."
Rachel Green,"I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!"
Rachel Green,No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Rachel Green,What's going on?
Rachel Green,Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Rachel Green,Hm-mmm.
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements."
Rachel Green,Big night!
Rachel Green,"Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back."
Rachel Green,Here you go. Thank you!
Rachel Green,"Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it."
Rachel Green,Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Rachel Green,Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Rachel Green,Because I lose her stuff!
Rachel Green,"Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!"
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!"
Rachel Green,"Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women."
Rachel Green,"But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing."
Rachel Green,"Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!"
Rachel Green,Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Rachel Green,Okay that is the one we already have!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault."
Rachel Green,"It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!"
Rachel Green,Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer."
Rachel Green,"Okay, calm down, here they are."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I don't know."
Rachel Green,"Oh gosh, she's going to kill me."
Rachel Green,Ohh that'd be great!
Rachel Green,"Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too."
Rachel Green,Your sunglasses?!
Rachel Green,"Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to..."
Rachel Green,I'm sorry.
Rachel Green,"Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes."
Rachel Green,"Hey! Hey! Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?"
Rachel Green,"No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person."
Rachel Green,"Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you."
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?"
Rachel Green,"Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought."
Rachel Green,"Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number."
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Rachel Green,Yay!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, thank God! Finally!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog."
Rachel Green,Great! Thanks!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?"
Rachel Green,"Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?"
Rachel Green,"No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!"
Rachel Green,Hey! What's up?!
Rachel Green,So all we have is ice?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Oh. Oh!
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,What?! We can't do that!
Rachel Green,Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
Rachel Green,I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Rachel Green,Ugh!
Rachel Green,"Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!"
Rachel Green,Noooooooo!
Rachel Green,"No, wait. Wait."
Rachel Green,"No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!"
Rachel Green,Yeah well unless we tell him.
Rachel Green,"Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message."
Rachel Green,Right?
Rachel Green,Hey! Hi!
Rachel Green,"Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?"
Rachel Green,What?! What? What happened?!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,Because a car backfired?
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today."
Rachel Green,"No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine."
Rachel Green,"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her."
Rachel Green,"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision."
Rachel Green,"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?"
Rachel Green,"Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff."
Rachel Green,"I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?"
Rachel Green,"Well, there you go!"
Rachel Green,Close call day.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, honey no problem. Okay."
Rachel Green,Oh?
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, you guys..."
Rachel Green,Is Monica here?
Rachel Green,"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl."
Rachel Green,"Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?"
Rachel Green,Okay! Check it out!
Rachel Green,"It's a, it's a cat!"
Rachel Green,Yes it is!
Rachel Green,"Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!"
Rachel Green,"Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal."
Rachel Green,A thousand bucks.
Rachel Green,"All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!"
Rachel Green,"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time."
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Well, it's my cat."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, I got a cat."
Rachel Green,"You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!"""
Rachel Green,"Well, I was gonna let you play with it."
Rachel Green,"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!"
Rachel Green,I tried! They won't take her back.
Rachel Green,"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?"
Rachel Green,"No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!"
Rachel Green,Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!
Rachel Green,It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Rachel Green,"Oh no! No! It's actually-it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! Yeah, do you want it?"
Rachel Green,"Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!"
Rachel Green,Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Rachel Green,"Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000."
Rachel Green,"Okay, a thousand."
Rachel Green,"Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat."
Rachel Green,"Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?"
Rachel Green,"It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, 15 hundred dollars."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, there you go."
Rachel Green,"Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind."
Rachel Green,Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, are you okay?"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long."
Rachel Green,"No, I meant with the dropper over here."
Rachel Green,"Well, my eye is a little itchy."
Rachel Green,Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!"
Rachel Green,"Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?"
Rachel Green,Monica! Come on!
Rachel Green,Ross! Stop it! Come on!
Rachel Green,Chandler!
Rachel Green,Just stop it! Come on!
Rachel Green,"All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! Ohhh! No! Look what I did! Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Rachel Green,"All right, I'm outta here!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,So were done then!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. Okay."
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Okay. Okay!
Rachel Green,"Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye."
Rachel Green,Great!
Rachel Green,"Okay, just give me the damn drops!"
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better."
Rachel Green,Damn!
Rachel Green,Bye you guys!
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss."
Rachel Green,"Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose."
Rachel Green,Eh! Stop it!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!"
Rachel Green,All right!
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Okay, they are."
Rachel Green,Four.
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,Great!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Well, well, you said it was practice!"
Rachel Green,Because I knew you were lying!
Rachel Green,What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Rachel Green,Monica! Stop it!
Rachel Green,"Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!"
Rachel Green,Yep!
Rachel Green,What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Rachel Green,No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Rachel Green,Sucker!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that."
Rachel Green,That sounds great.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night."
Rachel Green,No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Rachel Green,"No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked."
Rachel Green,"Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen...naked! I'm picking up an orange. I'm naked! Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully."
Rachel Green,"Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya, baby! Darnit! Ugh."
Rachel Green,"Uh, yeah, if you want too."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure?"
Rachel Green,"And um, what-what is that Ross?"
Rachel Green,What?! Are you crazy?
Rachel Green,"Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!"
Rachel Green,"Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh wow! I'm sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!"
Rachel Green,"Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of ""us?"""
Rachel Green,"Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love."
Rachel Green,I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Rachel Green,"No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times."
Rachel Green,"Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily."
Rachel Green,"No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?"
Rachel Green,"Ross! What are you... I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident."
Rachel Green,"Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent."
Rachel Green,Ahh.
Rachel Green,"Hello! Ohh, kids love me."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Pancho Vila?
Rachel Green,"What are you talking about Pheebs? I don't... Oh my God, you drew on me?!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can-you have so crossed a line."
Rachel Green,"All right, it won't come off!"
Rachel Green,It won't come off!
Rachel Green,"No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on."
Rachel Green,Hi!!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,What?! What else did he say?
Rachel Green,"Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, I am a human doodle!!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, I need a, I need a drink!"
Rachel Green,Macadamia nut?
Rachel Green,Hm-mmm!
Rachel Green,Nope!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel."
Rachel Green,Hit me!
Rachel Green,I bet 20.
Rachel Green,Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Hit me.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second. Whup, okay. Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?"
Rachel Green,Ohhh!!
Rachel Green,"Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? There's only one way I'm leaving this hotel room."
Rachel Green,Good luck to ya!
Rachel Green,Wow!
Rachel Green,Hello!
Rachel Green,Hello!
Rachel Green,"Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!"
Rachel Green,Wait! Okay!
Rachel Green,"Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!"
Rachel Green,Wait! Okay!
Rachel Green,Ohhh!
Rachel Green,I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid."
Rachel Green,"I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night."
Rachel Green,Who got married?!
Rachel Green,"No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,"Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, hubby!"
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Okay! So, we'll just stay married."
Rachel Green,And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Rachel Green,"Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding."
Rachel Green,What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me."
Rachel Green,You are asking me to be your wife!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married."
Rachel Green,Oh b-b-but it is!
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!"
Rachel Green,"Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?"
Rachel Green,"Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the..."
Rachel Green,"All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful."
Rachel Green,"Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?"
Rachel Green,"Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?"
Rachel Green,Pheebs?
Rachel Green,"Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater."
Rachel Green,"Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?"
Rachel Green,"Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater."
Rachel Green,Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Rachel Green,"Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica."
Rachel Green,"Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!"
Rachel Green,What was that?!
Rachel Green,I haven't seen it yet!
Rachel Green,Noooooooo!!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel."
Rachel Green,"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
Rachel Green,"And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!"
Rachel Green,"And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late."
Rachel Green,Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...
Rachel Green,Hey roomie!
Rachel Green,Are you pregnant?!
Rachel Green,Um-hmm.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Sure? Thanks.
Rachel Green,"Monica, where did you get these?!"
Rachel Green,"Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,What the hell is that?
Rachel Green,"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!"
Rachel Green,"Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time."
Rachel Green,Are you okay? You're not blinking.
Rachel Green,"Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era."
Rachel Green,What is the matter with you?!
Rachel Green,"All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe."
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,But I...
Rachel Green,It is? Really?
Rachel Green,"I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?"
Rachel Green,What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
Rachel Green,I mean it's the end of an era!
Rachel Green,Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I wanna ask you something."
Rachel Green,Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...
Rachel Green,...how about I move in with you?
Rachel Green,You have a roommate?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's true."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place."
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I have to ask you..."
Rachel Green,You're just staring into space.
Rachel Green,This one?
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Yeah! Why?
Rachel Green,That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Rachel Green,"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!"
Rachel Green,"Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Rachel Green,I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!
Rachel Green,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in."
Rachel Green,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!"
Rachel Green,"No-no, I'm staying put."
Rachel Green,"Why, where are you going?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Oh wow.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?"
Rachel Green,"Well, because of us! Because of our history."
Rachel Green,No?
Rachel Green,No! Not at all!
Rachel Green,"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend..."
Rachel Green,"But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky."""
Rachel Green,"Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied."
Rachel Green,"No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out."
Rachel Green,"Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?"
Rachel Green,"Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back."
Rachel Green,"All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later."
Rachel Green,"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's."
Rachel Green,"So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?"
Rachel Green,And?
Rachel Green,Look at that!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"No-no, I bought those."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Well, who wouldn't?!"
Rachel Green,And Mrs.?!
Rachel Green,What?!!
Rachel Green,Ohh! Oh God!
Rachel Green,Yeah honey you don't believe her do you?
Rachel Green,"Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?"
Rachel Green,"Some uh, some visual aides."
Rachel Green,"Hey Pheebs, you're still alive! How are you doing?"
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, what-what are you doing?"
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?"
Rachel Green,Monica!
Rachel Green,Did-did you take these back?
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, they're really great! Aren't they?"
Rachel Green,Yeah. Nice try!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Wow, that's great Ross, I'm sorry we weren't more supportive before."
Rachel Green,"Well, we're a little early, the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. Hey sisters! Wow, we really are bitches."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and not a very good one."
Rachel Green,"Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year."
Rachel Green,No! They are mine!
Rachel Green,You stole them from me!!
Rachel Green,Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Rachel Green,Well...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they're probably not even listening!"
Rachel Green,Of course they're listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Rachel Green,Really? Really?!
Rachel Green,"Okay! ""Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, we'd like you to come on board with us full time!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Really?! How do you know?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Hello?
Rachel Green,"Uh no, he's not. Can I take a message?"
Rachel Green,Ross got married again-Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Rachel Green,"Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!"
Rachel Green,I cannot believe that you didn't tell me that we are still married!!
Rachel Green,When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! Ross didn't get the annulment; we are still married.
Rachel Green,"So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross's, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now."
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs."
Rachel Green,Well there's an idea!!
Rachel Green,"That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?"
Rachel Green,"December 26th, huh maybe she's Santa Clause."
Rachel Green,"Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye."
Rachel Green,"Well sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! All right, now I'm gonna do this my way and I don't want to hear a peep out of you!"
Rachel Green,Op! You're peeping!
Rachel Green,"Ross! Y'know what, I just got-why? Why did you do this?!"
Rachel Green,"I don't wanna hear ""Three failed marriages!"""
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know what? Thanks to you I'm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don't think I have ever been this angry!"
Rachel Green,Ugh!
Rachel Green,"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out."
Rachel Green,"Uh yes, heroin and crack."
Rachel Green,"Well, you would know."
Rachel Green,"Ross, please, I found the magazines!"
Rachel Green,Ugh!
Rachel Green,"Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?"
Rachel Green,"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think."
Rachel Green,What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Rachel Green,"Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!"
Rachel Green,"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!"
Rachel Green,And thank you for your time.
Rachel Green,This is totally your fault!
Rachel Green,"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!"
Rachel Green,Don't call us that!
Rachel Green,"Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried."
Rachel Green,"Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!"
Rachel Green,Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Rachel Green,Nothing.
Rachel Green,Uh-hmm.
Rachel Green,"Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession."
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea."
Rachel Green,"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?"
Rachel Green,"And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, don't push it though."
Rachel Green,"I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut."
Rachel Green,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special."
Rachel Green,"Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this."
Rachel Green,I'm gonna need a copy of those.
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I was wondering..."
Rachel Green,Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Rachel Green,Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
Rachel Green,Surprise!!
Rachel Green,"No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!"
Rachel Green,"Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades."
Rachel Green,You remember when we got these?
Rachel Green,I guess you weren't there.
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving."
Rachel Green,I have one.
Rachel Green,"Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen."
Rachel Green,You get your messages!
Rachel Green,"So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?"
Rachel Green,"Ooh, your brother. Score!"
Rachel Green,"You know what else I'm not gonna miss? ""I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"""
Rachel Green,"""I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"""
Rachel Green,"""Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"""
Rachel Green,I'm unpacking!
Rachel Green,I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
Rachel Green,"Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!"
Rachel Green,Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
Rachel Green,Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
Rachel Green,Great! Monica's moving!
Rachel Green,Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm just mad!"
Rachel Green,"Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler."
Rachel Green,"Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving."
Rachel Green,Oh really? Like what Monica?
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, good start Mon."
Rachel Green,Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that."
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's gonna be fine."
Rachel Green,"But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!"
Rachel Green,Bye house!
Rachel Green,Bye Mon.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Hi...
Rachel Green,Rachel...
Rachel Green,Phoebe's...
Rachel Green,leave...
Rachel Green,"Wait, I-I just said ""leave."""
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, come on that's silly."
Rachel Green,"No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Everybody...
Rachel Green,Rachel...
Rachel Green,Phoebe's...
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y'know roommate bonding thing."
Rachel Green,Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Rachel Green,OK!
Rachel Green,Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man."
Rachel Green,Oh! I used to do that too!
Rachel Green,"Aw, Mon..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her."
Rachel Green,"You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth."
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!"
Rachel Green,Ankle.
Rachel Green,"No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!"
Rachel Green,"No, wait Phoebe."
Rachel Green,"Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you."
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I should've told you the truth."
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little..."
Rachel Green,"Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy."
Rachel Green,Because they're people.
Rachel Green,"Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes."
Rachel Green,"I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!"
Rachel Green,Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore."
Rachel Green,"I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren."
Rachel Green,Yeah. A year ago..
Rachel Green,"But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much."
Rachel Green,Sure.
Rachel Green,Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Rachel Green,What? What!?! You kissed him?
Rachel Green,Phoebe are you serious?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?"
Rachel Green,Phoebe...
Rachel Green,"Oh, Kim, Hi."
Rachel Green,"So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought."
Rachel Green,"Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?"
Rachel Green,So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren."
Rachel Green,"Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year."
Rachel Green,"That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy."
Rachel Green,"Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!"
Rachel Green,To get you to make out with him!!!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, hi, Kim."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen."
Rachel Green,"Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him."
Rachel Green,I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Rachel Green,"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job."
Rachel Green,I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Rachel Green,"You were with Kenny today, weren't you?"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?"
Rachel Green,"I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't."
Rachel Green,That wouldn't help me.
Rachel Green,"Kim, hi."
Rachel Green,Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry."" And then I don't know why but he said, ""and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."""
Rachel Green,Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
Rachel Green,You and Ralph?
Rachel Green,"Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!"
Rachel Green,Nothing?
Rachel Green,"So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?"
Rachel Green,"Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?"
Rachel Green,Her dancer friends?
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,"I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be ""Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing."""
Rachel Green,"Look at it, isn't it beautiful?"
Rachel Green,"It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!"
Rachel Green,"The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought ""well, there's mincemeat pie,"" I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?"
Rachel Green,And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
Rachel Green,"Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!"
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic."
Rachel Green,"Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like ""Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"""
Rachel Green,"So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?"
Rachel Green,Okay...
Rachel Green,"What's up, Ross?"
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Oh no. No Ross, don't do this."
Rachel Green,I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Rachel Green,"I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now."
Rachel Green,"No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert."
Rachel Green,"No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!"
Rachel Green,It sure is.
Rachel Green,Beef.
Rachel Green,"Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste."
Rachel Green,"Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!"
Rachel Green,"Op! Wait, you dropped a pea."
Rachel Green,Well?
Rachel Green,Really? How good?
Rachel Green,"Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it."
Rachel Green,"...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!"
Rachel Green,I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Rachel Green,"You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!"
Rachel Green,"That's a good story, Grandpa."
Rachel Green,"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story."
Rachel Green,"Well, I used to date him, but you're still going out with her!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing."
Rachel Green,"Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
Rachel Green,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Rachel Green,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
Rachel Green,That's right!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
Rachel Green,"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
Rachel Green,We are so gonna find them this year.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats."
Rachel Green,"Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?"
Rachel Green,Ha!
Rachel Green,"Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, this is hollow."
Rachel Green,"This bench, it's hollow! I can't believe I never knew that! Oh, the presents!!!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, this one's for me!"
Rachel Green,"Ooh, let's open them!"
Rachel Green,"Whatever Linus, I'm opening mine."
Rachel Green,"Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?"
Rachel Green,'Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Rachel Green,Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away."
Rachel Green,Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Rachel Green,Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Rachel Green,Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Rachel Green,Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Rachel Green,"Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Guess!
Rachel Green,"Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, yes."
Rachel Green,Almost.
Rachel Green,It was only 500 bucks.
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then."
Rachel Green,"Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar."
Rachel Green,And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?"
Rachel Green,"Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains."
Rachel Green,Hey! We're here!
Rachel Green,Ohh! Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Oh no!
Rachel Green,"Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!"
Rachel Green,I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Rachel Green,Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Rachel Green,"I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?"
Rachel Green,"Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you."
Rachel Green,"Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!"
Rachel Green,He got it a flea market!
Rachel Green,That's funny.
Rachel Green,Ohh!!
Rachel Green,Noooooo!!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!"
Rachel Green,Oh yes.
Rachel Green,"...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table."
Rachel Green,"I know, I know. I went a little crazy."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times."
Rachel Green,"Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear."
Rachel Green,Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come."
Rachel Green,"Oh, she does want to."
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, those bastards! Let's go."
Rachel Green,"No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side."
Rachel Green,"Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad."
Rachel Green,"Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross."
Rachel Green,What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
Rachel Green,Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Rachel Green,That's right!
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny."
Rachel Green,We are looking at a Playboy.
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'"
Rachel Green,"You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy"
Rachel Green,I don't know.
Rachel Green,"Monica, what are you doing?"
Rachel Green,"Well, people are different."
Rachel Green,"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover."
Rachel Green,"Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch."
Rachel Green,I cannot believe her.
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place."
Rachel Green,"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there."
Rachel Green,"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine."
Rachel Green,"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin."
Rachel Green,Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Rachel Green,"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky."
Rachel Green,"So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover."
Rachel Green,I am not a pushover!
Rachel Green,"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard."
Rachel Green,How-how did you lose your job here?
Rachel Green,"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right."
Rachel Green,"Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him..."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs."
Rachel Green,"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?"
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?"
Rachel Green,"Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Jill!"
Rachel Green,This is Chandler.
Rachel Green,And you know Monica and Ross!
Rachel Green,"And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey."
Rachel Green,"Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!"
Rachel Green,Wow! What did he say?
Rachel Green,Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?"
Rachel Green,"Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?"
Rachel Green,Hey! What's goin' on?
Rachel Green,Jill! Did you shop?!
Rachel Green,"You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!"
Rachel Green,What'd you get?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Apartment pants?
Rachel Green,"No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?"
Rachel Green,A pajmena?
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Jill?
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!"
Rachel Green,"All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,What's up?!
Rachel Green,"Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,With Ross and Jill?
Rachel Green,With Ross and my sister?
Rachel Green,With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Rachel Green,Oh there is no way.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me."
Rachel Green,"Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front."
Rachel Green,"That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university."
Rachel Green,"Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?"
Rachel Green,"I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?"
Rachel Green,Are-are you saying he's a geek?
Rachel Green,"No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!"
Rachel Green,What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant."
Rachel Green,"Yeah but, he's not your type."
Rachel Green,"Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?"
Rachel Green,She-she died Jill.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Well yeah...
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,Oh so-so not really never.
Rachel Green,Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I don't like it."
Rachel Green,It's kinda slutty.
Rachel Green,"Yeah well, I'm-I'm a slut."
Rachel Green,Rachel.
Rachel Green,"Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not!"
Rachel Green,Why aren't you home yet?!
Rachel Green,"Oh yes, it's me! Sorry!"
Rachel Green,"Uh, I'm just, I'm just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, he brought her back to his apartment."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, she is a slut!"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, look-look he's taking off her clothes!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, this is just terrible."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Rachel Green,Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Rachel Green,Oh don't even ask!
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!"
Rachel Green,I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
Rachel Green,"Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?"
Rachel Green,"So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, slides. So really nothing happened."
Rachel Green,"Right. Was it the, ""Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"""
Rachel Green,She asked-asked you out again?
Rachel Green,"Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it."
Rachel Green,Thank you. I...yeah.
Rachel Green,"No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!"
Rachel Green,Ross thanks.
Rachel Green,"Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah do it now, call right now."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Rachel Green,"It's not random, it's Bob."
Rachel Green,"No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to."
Rachel Green,Hm-mmm.
Rachel Green,Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history...
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,Y'know Bob in Human Resources...
Rachel Green,"Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just..."
Rachel Green,I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Rachel Green,Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
Rachel Green,"All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!"
Rachel Green,In Human Resources!!!!!!
Rachel Green,...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Rachel Green,Do I have my own castle?
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark."
Rachel Green,Absolutely not.
Rachel Green,Probably just the first half.
Rachel Green,"Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!"
Rachel Green,Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
Rachel Green,"Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her."
Rachel Green,What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Rachel Green,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Rachel Green,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!"
Rachel Green,Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Rachel Green,What?! You kissed!
Rachel Green,"Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!"
Rachel Green,Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Rachel Green,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I got that."
Rachel Green,Bye-bye-e!
Rachel Green,"Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!"
Rachel Green,Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me."
Rachel Green,"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?"
Rachel Green,Merrill Lynch?
Rachel Green,Well why didn't you take the job?
Rachel Green,Rob Tillman!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, of course Monica's brother!"
Rachel Green,Wow! How are you?!
Rachel Green,Ohh! Me too!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I would love too."
Rachel Green,Ohh! Okay!
Rachel Green,"Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?"
Rachel Green,Oh yeah? Okay.

Rachel Green,"Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?"
Rachel Green,Oh yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah. Right. So now, are-do you, do you still do music?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!"
Rachel Green,You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Rachel Green,He's coming over! He's coming over!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you..."
Rachel Green,Ah!
Rachel Green,Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't."
Rachel Green,Isn't that a line from the show?!
Rachel Green,That's a line from the show too!
Rachel Green,"Yeah sure, iced tea would be great."
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did."
Rachel Green,"Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?"
Rachel Green,"Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!"
Rachel Green,Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!"
Rachel Green,"Monica. You've, you've done it right?"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!"
Rachel Green,"Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever..."
Rachel Green,Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Rachel Green,Oh! Thank God!
Rachel Green,"Okay! Here we go! Okay! Hi, Joey! It's Rachel! Umm, I am free tomorrow night. Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches."
Rachel Green,"Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!"
Rachel Green,Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!"
Rachel Green,"Umm, can I use your bathroom?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it sure is!"
Rachel Green,"Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?"
Rachel Green,Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands."
Rachel Green,Oh right.
Rachel Green,Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Rachel Green,"Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh..."
Rachel Green,God I'm just a horrible person.
Rachel Green,"Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person."
Rachel Green,"The ring from the cave, yeah."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!"
Rachel Green,No! No-no-no...
Rachel Green,But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Rachel Green,Oh that's right! I'm sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Rachel Green,Hi Ross!

Rachel Green,"Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!"
Rachel Green,"Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!"
Rachel Green,Sit down!
Rachel Green,"Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!"
Rachel Green,No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Rachel Green,Aw what are you?! A detective?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Who are these men?
Rachel Green,"Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay."
Rachel Green,Good day for married people huh?
Rachel Green,I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!"
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Rachel Green,Isn't that a kind of sushi?
Rachel Green,Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Rachel Green,"Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour."
Rachel Green,"Well, Valentine's Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar!"
Rachel Green,"Aw, I love that."
Rachel Green,"Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun."
Rachel Green,"Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!"

Rachel Green,"All right, so we weren't prepared!"
Rachel Green,"Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll."

Rachel Green,"I... Well, I don't think they need any help."
Rachel Green,Who wrote it?
Rachel Green,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?"
Rachel Green,Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
Rachel Green,"Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!"
Rachel Green,"Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!"
Rachel Green,My God!
Rachel Green,Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Rachel Green,Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
Rachel Green,"Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time."
Rachel Green,"Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles."
Rachel Green,Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
Rachel Green,"Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident."
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,I have.

Rachel Green,"Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
Rachel Green,Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!

Rachel Green,"No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!"
Rachel Green,I know. I'm sorry.
Rachel Green,"Hi Joey, how ya doin'?"
Rachel Green,"Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now."
Rachel Green,I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Rachel Green,That refrigerators don't live as long as people.
Rachel Green,You're jokin' right?
Rachel Green,Thank God you're pretty.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Do you guys know any cute guys?
Rachel Green,"Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go..."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot."
Rachel Green,Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Rachel Green,"Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux."

Rachel Green,"Oh, thank you."
Rachel Green,What are you guys doing?
Rachel Green,"Oh, but y'know, no, you didn't give me your phone number."

Rachel Green,I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? Maybe I should go!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm good."
Rachel Green,No-no! Don't dance for me! Please? Don't! What is the matter with you guys?
Rachel Green,I... Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Rachel Green,"I'll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It's you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!"
Rachel Green,"I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean congratulations on all the cash, and-and y'know--Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!"
Rachel Green,Thank you!
Rachel Green,"Oh that's all right! Y'know, I ended up having a really good time. Y'know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness."
Rachel Green,I wanna say a disease.
Rachel Green,Huh. All right.
Rachel Green,Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Rachel Green,So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Rachel Green,"Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!"
Rachel Green,"Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!"
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, what?"
Rachel Green,"Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message."
Rachel Green,Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Rachel Green,Already? That's pretty bad what you did.
Rachel Green,"I'm sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y'know, you fight, you make up, it's just the way it works."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!"
Rachel Green,What?!!
Rachel Green,You fell asleep?!
Rachel Green,Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Rachel Green,"And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
Rachel Green,That is the most ridiculous...
Rachel Green,I did not sell you out.
Rachel Green,Would you let me talk.
Rachel Green,"OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- Ow. That hurt"
Rachel Green,Fine!
Rachel Green,"Okay, Chandler!"
Rachel Green,"And your horoscope says, ""On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."""
Rachel Green,"Op, but the twelfth brings a lover's spat."
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself."
Rachel Green,Oh my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Rachel Green,Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,We do?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Hi, I'm sorry I'm late but I am ready, ready to talk you up! When does Liz's father get here?"
Rachel Green,Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Rachel Green,Oh hi!
Rachel Green,Oh! Well let's look for them. Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Rachel Green,All right!
Rachel Green,Oh good.
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?"
Rachel Green,"Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy."
Rachel Green,You just don't look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Rachel Green,Oh. We?
Rachel Green,"Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just-I meant y'know are you still a 'We' or are you just 'You?'"
Rachel Green,Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Rachel Green,Ohh. Ooh!
Rachel Green,I was just getting him to like you.
Rachel Green,"Ross, Joey is not here."
Rachel Green,"Ross, it's okay. You can come out."
Rachel Green,Bye!
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know he lost his keys so he was looking for them..."
Rachel Green,"No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y'know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee."
Rachel Green,"Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy!"
Rachel Green,Wh-You dated my sister!
Rachel Green,What? Why?!
Rachel Green,"Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let's face it, so far the guy's not lovin' ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y'know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!"
Rachel Green,Oh it's important!
Rachel Green,"So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me."
Rachel Green,Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Rachel Green,"Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake."
Rachel Green,"Oh! Whoops! I'm sorry, you were talking about Emily!"
Rachel Green,"I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage."
Rachel Green,"Now wait a minute that's not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn't tell me. Maybe I have to pee again."
Rachel Green,"Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!"
Rachel Green,Oh! I've got a lot of those too!
Rachel Green,What's the matter?
Rachel Green,So what-what is the exhibit.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Rachel Green,Umm.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, the gift shop!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned."
Rachel Green,What?! No! Why?!
Rachel Green,I didn't know you could get married here.
Rachel Green,Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
Rachel Green,"Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list"
Rachel Green,"Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it."
Rachel Green,I'm gonna do it too!
Rachel Green,"Really? Who would, who would you marry?"
Rachel Green,Oh Pheebs.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house."
Rachel Green,It's so secluded up here.
Rachel Green,I feel like we're the only two people in the world. Oops. Sorry.
Rachel Green,"No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I-would you-actually, would you go check on that?"
Rachel Green,"Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?"
Rachel Green,Okay. What?! What are you doing here?!
Rachel Green,I came with Paul!
Rachel Green,Get up!
Rachel Green,Ahh. Thank you!
Rachel Green,"Op, ice. I need ice."
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on! No! Not in there! He's in there!
Rachel Green,Go-go!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, thank you."
Rachel Green,"Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage."
Rachel Green,Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Rachel Green,"Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?"
Rachel Green,"That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!"
Rachel Green,"Whoa, that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!"
Rachel Green,"Really? Okay. Okay, I-I'll go upstairs. If-if you get me something from the car."
Rachel Green,Surprise me.
Rachel Green,"So you're gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that's where everybody's gonna be!"
Rachel Green,Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! I need another soda!
Rachel Green,Oh my God Ross! What in heaven's name are you doing here?
Rachel Green,"Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings."
Rachel Green,So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours."
Rachel Green,"No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag."
Rachel Green,"Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?"
Rachel Green,"All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,Hm-mmm.
Rachel Green,"That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go."
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?"
Rachel Green,What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Rachel Green,"My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Rachel Green,"Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!"
Rachel Green,What's the other one?
Rachel Green,"Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues."
Rachel Green,No you don't!
Rachel Green,Hi. I'm back.
Rachel Green,"Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot."
Rachel Green,A lover?
Rachel Green,Oh yeah surfer?
Rachel Green,"Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?"
Rachel Green,"I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!"
Rachel Green,Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
Rachel Green,"I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm..."
Rachel Green,"Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
Rachel Green,Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Rachel Green,"Yeah? Well, you should know. You've bought like a billion of 'em."
Rachel Green,Ohh...
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, I'm so sorry."
Rachel Green,How about you guys?
Rachel Green,I think so.
Rachel Green,"Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?"
Rachel Green,"See? Now, he could date her."
Rachel Green,We're just really...very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Rachel Green,Oh! Thank you!
Rachel Green,"Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it."
Rachel Green,"Uh, wh-why?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi!"
Rachel Green,"Someone? I brought people. Mr. Thompson, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson. He's the head of my department."
Rachel Green,And I also brought my friend Joey...
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know I-I don't know where he is."
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know what? Actually, I was about to bid on this lovely trip to Paris."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Thank you. Okay, twenty dollars."
Rachel Green,Ugh! So close!
Rachel Green,What are you doing?
Rachel Green,Well now it's an empty bar.
Rachel Green,What?! What?! What?!
Rachel Green,"Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!"
Rachel Green,Joey! Sit down!
Rachel Green,What were you thinking?!
Rachel Green,Wh?!
Rachel Green,Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Rachel Green,Ugh!
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?"
Rachel Green,How is you drinking helping the kids?
Rachel Green,"Joey! Joey, good one!"
Rachel Green,"Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!"
Rachel Green,"I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Not great.
Rachel Green,Oh great!
Rachel Green,Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Rachel Green,"Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000."
Rachel Green,Okay. Okay.
Rachel Green,Ohh...
Rachel Green,Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
Rachel Green,"Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, ""The Pam."""
Rachel Green,"Okay, uh-uh imagine this, ""The Mr. Bowmont."""
Rachel Green,"Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy."
Rachel Green,What?! What?!
Rachel Green,"But Joey you don't have $20,000!"
Rachel Green,"Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!"
Rachel Green,"Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married."
Rachel Green,"Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?"
Rachel Green,No! I'm so happy for them!
Rachel Green,I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
Rachel Green,"I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing."
Rachel Green,Yeah me too.
Rachel Green,"Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille."
Rachel Green,We're gonna find love!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though."
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other."
Rachel Green,Exactly!
Rachel Green,You do?
Rachel Green,Who?
Rachel Green,Joey?!
Rachel Green,Are you serious?!
Rachel Green,"Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey."
Rachel Green,"Oh, seriously?"
Rachel Green,Charming.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Hey you!
Rachel Green,"Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?"
Rachel Green,"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What's that?!"""
Rachel Green,Exactly.
Rachel Green,What? Who?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup."
Rachel Green,"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!"
Rachel Green,Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
Rachel Green,"Oh God, Phoebe!"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?"
Rachel Green,Pick one.
Rachel Green,You're welcome.
Rachel Green,Joey! We should just switch.
Rachel Green,"Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!"
Rachel Green,"Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you're on your own."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Oh, thanks."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well thank you, you too."
Rachel Green,"Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?"
Rachel Green,Ohh...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?"
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone."
Rachel Green,Shake it off.
Rachel Green,"No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing."
Rachel Green,"Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff."
Rachel Green,"Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!"
Rachel Green,"Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night."
Rachel Green,"Yeah-yeah, we never had that,"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, but it is just about..."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Rachel Green,Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Rachel Green,"Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!"
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,"No-no, it's really not huge."
Rachel Green,"Joey, you are not! You're 31."
Rachel Green,"Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look..."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing."
Rachel Green,"Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!"
Rachel Green,I care!
Rachel Green,"Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?"
Rachel Green,Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Rachel Green,"Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?"
Rachel Green,"No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Monica, what are you talking about?"
Rachel Green,"Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!"
Rachel Green,Oh!!
Rachel Green,"Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!"
Rachel Green,"All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!"
Rachel Green,"I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!"
Rachel Green,"Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?"
Rachel Green,"Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!"
Rachel Green,"We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it."
Rachel Green,Who is it?
Rachel Green,Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?"
Rachel Green,"All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!"
Rachel Green,No you don't know why!
Rachel Green,Because! Because I was sad.
Rachel Green,"Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!"
Rachel Green,"Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music..."
Rachel Green,"Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks..."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Aw.
Rachel Green,What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Rachel Green,"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Now Joey, what did the duck do?!"
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?"
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Joey, did you my face cream?"
Rachel Green,"Joey, where did you learn that word?"
Rachel Green,You found my book?!
Rachel Green,"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!"
Rachel Green,"Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand."
Rachel Green,Well what happened at dinner?
Rachel Green,"Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!"
Rachel Green,"No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack."
Rachel Green,Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Rachel Green,Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Rachel Green,Ohh! Really?!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, you guys are so made for each other."
Rachel Green,Joey.
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha."
Rachel Green,"Well no, I don't smell anything."
Rachel Green,Nothing!
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!"
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you."
Rachel Green,Who are you supposed to be?
Rachel Green,Do you even know what a vicar is?
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!"
Rachel Green,All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
Rachel Green,"That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!"
Rachel Green,Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, what?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm..."
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey."
Rachel Green,"Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want."
Rachel Green,Yeah! I've been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Rachel Green,What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Rachel Green,That is the Coast Guard.
Rachel Green,"Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet."
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?"
Rachel Green,Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Rachel Green,No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Rachel Green,"Time's up, now your dead."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!"
Rachel Green,"Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time."
Rachel Green,"I don't know. Y'know, they didn't get us anything."
Rachel Green,"Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?"
Rachel Green,Why not?
Rachel Green,What? I was just trying to teach you.
Rachel Green,"Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets."
Rachel Green,"Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher."
Rachel Green,"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!"
Rachel Green,"All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling."
Rachel Green,I won't boss you around.
Rachel Green,"And, I'll be nice."
Rachel Green,And-Joey!
Rachel Green,"Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?"
Rachel Green,Right?
Rachel Green,"It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one."
Rachel Green,"Okay, go to the left. The left!"
Rachel Green,Just sit over there!!
Rachel Green,"No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling."
Rachel Green,"Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?"
Rachel Green,"Joey, come on! We just went over this!"
Rachel Green,"No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!"
Rachel Green,What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!
Rachel Green,Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!"
Rachel Green,"No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Awww...
Rachel Green,Left.
Rachel Green,"Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun."
Rachel Green,Ohh we're not sailing.

Rachel Green,"Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and..."
Rachel Green,Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Rachel Green,"Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in."
Rachel Green,Joey!
Rachel Green,Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Rachel Green,It's the same story.
Rachel Green,"Anyway, Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail."
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,I got-I get a big pay raise!
Rachel Green,I get to hire my own assistant!
Rachel Green,And you were at this job for four years?
Rachel Green,"Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?"
Rachel Green,"I've never interviewed anyone before. I've actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn't the same thing."
Rachel Green,"No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you."
Rachel Green,All right. I'm a total pro!
Rachel Green,"Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I'm sorry the models are actually down the hall."
Rachel Green,"Really?! Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what's-what is-what's your name?"
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh, go on."
Rachel Green,"That's your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let's-let's just have a look-see here."
Rachel Green,"Oh come on, what are you talking about? You've got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday's, come on!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, hold on just a second. I'm sorry, it's for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, you have an assistant right?"
Rachel Green,"No, I-I just don't know how you decide who to hire. I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there's this guy..."
Rachel Green,I love him. He's so pretty I wanna cry! I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh. No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? Look how pretty!"
Rachel Green,Okay you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Rachel Green,Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Rachel Green,Kinda.
Rachel Green,"Oh-ohh, thank you."
Rachel Green,Well...
Rachel Green,But I hired you!
Rachel Green,Yeah! You-you got the job! You're my new assistant!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes."
Rachel Green,"Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant."
Rachel Green,I'm sorry Joey.
Rachel Green,"Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?"
Rachel Green,"Joey, why would you do that?"
Rachel Green,"Tag? Hi, who was that?"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?"
Rachel Green,Okay. We'll be right back.
Rachel Green,"All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I'm telling you..."
Rachel Green,"Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done. But I'm telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. Yes?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Gay? Yeah.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well yeah, sure, what's up?"
Rachel Green,Oh really?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, did you not want people to know that?"
Rachel Green,Why's that?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things."
Rachel Green,'Kay.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, she's gay."
Rachel Green,"Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy."
Rachel Green,"Hey, I thought that guy was married."
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I gotta get back to work."
Rachel Green,"Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife."
Rachel Green,"I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it."
Rachel Green,Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
Rachel Green,"Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, well drop and give me ten more!"
Rachel Green,"Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?"
Rachel Green,"Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?"
Rachel Green,No. Why?
Rachel Green,Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Rachel Green,"Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah. All right, back to work."
Rachel Green,"Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor."
Rachel Green,Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure. Umm...here."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I don't think so Joe."
Rachel Green,"Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?"
Rachel Green,How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
Rachel Green,I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
Rachel Green,"Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it."
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?"
Rachel Green,Ohh that's nice.
Rachel Green,Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?"
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night."
Rachel Green,Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Rachel Green,"Y'know, all the women."
Rachel Green,"All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!"
Rachel Green,"All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!"
Rachel Green,"I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!"
Rachel Green,Yeah. Sure.
Rachel Green,"So, will you talk to him?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?"
Rachel Green,Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Rachel Green,Wow! I did not see that coming.
Rachel Green,"Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Sp-spoil?
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I'm startin' too."
Rachel Green,Yes! Hell yes!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,I'd love to!
Rachel Green,"Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! This is it! I really hope it's you!
Rachel Green,Me too!
Rachel Green,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!"
Rachel Green,Hypothetically!
Rachel Green,Uh-hmm.
Rachel Green,Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.
Rachel Green,"Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that..."
Rachel Green,Fine!
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I'm just-Wait a minute. If I'm your maid of honor that means you are Monica's.
Rachel Green,Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica's!
Rachel Green,Why does it matter so much to you?!
Rachel Green,What-what if I marry Ross-Or Joey?
Rachel Green,Yeah but Phoebe...
Rachel Green,Okay. Okay. It's-since you've never done it before you can be Monica's made of honor.
Rachel Green,I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Rachel Green,Better than Chandler.
Rachel Green,Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!
Rachel Green,You have been maid of honor before?!!
Rachel Green,All right that's it! I am maid of honor!
Rachel Green,How come you are?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can't we just flip a coin?!"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay fine, y'know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie."
Rachel Green,"Okay, uh..."
Rachel Green,...it's gonna be okay!
Rachel Green,"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts."
Rachel Green,Thanks!
Rachel Green,Thank you judges.
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre..."
Rachel Green,"Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old."
Rachel Green,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey."
Rachel Green,"Aw, thanks!"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Well then I demand a recount!
Rachel Green,"No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!"
Rachel Green,"Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!"
Rachel Green,Hi Pheebs.
Rachel Green,Hi! I just want to apologize. I'm really sorry I was a baby.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Yeah, and y'know you-you deserve to win. And-and y'know I was thinking about it, if-if you're Monica's maid of honor that means I get to be yours."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case..."
Rachel Green,"Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there."
Rachel Green,"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah..."
Rachel Green,You do? Why?
Rachel Green,"But Pheebs, y'know you earned it."
Rachel Green,"No, I was ten. I just developed early."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?"
Rachel Green,"Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!"
Rachel Green,What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
Rachel Green,Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?"
Rachel Green,"Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Would you like some pancakes?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!"
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,Oh and I'll call ya too!
Rachel Green,Bye!
Rachel Green,"Oh Joey, I'm sorry I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y'know we got to talking and I..."
Rachel Green,Cupid.
Rachel Green,"Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere."
Rachel Green,Fine.
Rachel Green,Phoebe!
Rachel Green,I'm sorry?
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was."
Rachel Green,Well now what's the rush?
Rachel Green,Well look who's here!
Rachel Green,"Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!"
Rachel Green,"Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to."
Rachel Green,Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
Rachel Green,How did it go with Erin?
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do."
Rachel Green,So how's it goin' with Joey?
Rachel Green,"Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him."
Rachel Green,But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Rachel Green,"Ugh, tramp!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, see ya."
Rachel Green,"Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship."
Rachel Green,"Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner."
Rachel Green,Joey...
Rachel Green,Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
Rachel Green,Well that too. Joey?
Rachel Green,Do you want some pancakes?
Rachel Green,"All right, I got 48."
Rachel Green,How come we have one extra place setting?
Rachel Green,"Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her."
Rachel Green,"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things."
Rachel Green,"Seriously, it's moving!"
Rachel Green,Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Rachel Green,"Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?"
Rachel Green,"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?"
Rachel Green,Interesting.
Rachel Green,Huh. A moo-point?
Rachel Green,"Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?"
Rachel Green,"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,How are you holding up?
Rachel Green,Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Rachel Green,So were you guys together a long time?
Rachel Green,Now that she broke up with you?
Rachel Green,Yeah. Hmmmm.
Rachel Green,"No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out."
Rachel Green,"Because, uh-it has to."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do."
Rachel Green,"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!"
Rachel Green,"Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!"
Rachel Green,"No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?"
Rachel Green,"Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi! How are you doing?"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace."
Rachel Green,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday."
Rachel Green,Gooood morning!!
Rachel Green,"Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!"
Rachel Green,"Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem."
Rachel Green,We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, we did other stuff too."
Rachel Green,"Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!"
Rachel Green,Anymore!!
Rachel Green,"Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us."
Rachel Green,"Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation."
Rachel Green,"Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate."
Rachel Green,"No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?"
Rachel Green,So did you read your evaluation yet?
Rachel Green,"Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!"
Rachel Green,I'm thinkin' no.
Rachel Green,"Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie."
Rachel Green,"Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, ""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch."
Rachel Green,"Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it."
Rachel Green,"Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!"
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Joey!
Rachel Green,Ugh!
Rachel Green,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office."
Rachel Green,Let's roll!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly."
Rachel Green,Well...
Rachel Green,Oh no-no-no...
Rachel Green,You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
Rachel Green,Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Rachel Green,"No, you could've lost your job."
Rachel Green,Thank you! You're great!
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Rachel Green,There it is.
Rachel Green,Oh my god!!
Rachel Green,You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Rachel Green,Did you know he was in there?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Drums?
Rachel Green,Ha!
Rachel Green,"Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air."
Rachel Green,"What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula."
Rachel Green,"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?"
Rachel Green,And that makes you angry because...
Rachel Green,Where did you get that?
Rachel Green,Phoebe?
Rachel Green,"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!"
Rachel Green,"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's so much more fun with you."
Rachel Green,We did!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I would love to!"
Rachel Green,"Good, good, good, good, good."
Rachel Green,Um... Done!
Rachel Green,Oh wow! Look at this place!
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?"
Rachel Green,And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Rachel Green,Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!
Rachel Green,See?
Rachel Green,"You can't, because of the new skylight!"
Rachel Green,So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Rachel Green,Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?
Rachel Green,Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, it's okay. I like living with Joey."
Rachel Green,"Oh please, I hate packing, it's closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you."
Rachel Green,"I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,I got it!
Rachel Green,Its back in cage!
Rachel Green,"Joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!"
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief."
Rachel Green,"Why, why not?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry what?"
Rachel Green,"Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?"
Rachel Green,"""Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy."" Big Daddy?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?"
Rachel Green,"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?"
Rachel Green,"It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!"
Rachel Green,Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Rachel Green,"Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois."
Rachel Green,"What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!"
Rachel Green,Its still there!
Rachel Green,She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
Rachel Green,No that could kill her.
Rachel Green,No so we're protecting her.
Rachel Green,But we should move quick.
Rachel Green,Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Rachel Green,Oh my God! That is so good!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?"
Rachel Green,Mm-mmm.
Rachel Green,"Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!"
Rachel Green,What?! What?!
Rachel Green,Wait a minute!
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!"
Rachel Green,You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Rachel Green,"What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy."
Rachel Green,"Okay! All right, pick a half."
Rachel Green,Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Rachel Green,"That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece."
Rachel Green,Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Rachel Green,"Hey, come on now!"
Rachel Green,"No. No, you can't."
Rachel Green,Oh I don't-I don't know.
Rachel Green,"Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie."
Rachel Green,"Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?"
Rachel Green,"No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?"
Rachel Green,Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
Rachel Green,"Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!"
Rachel Green,"Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, ""Must go out today,"" and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy."
Rachel Green,"Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk."
Rachel Green,Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Rachel Green,"No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office."
Rachel Green,Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
Rachel Green,"Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever."
Rachel Green,"Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk."
Rachel Green,"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, ""Must go out today."" So you just keep looking in there! All right?"
Rachel Green,"Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?"
Rachel Green,I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
Rachel Green,Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
Rachel Green,"Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh... ...fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Rachel Green,"Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?"
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check."
Rachel Green,Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Rachel Green,You put these on my desk!
Rachel Green,"Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!"
Rachel Green,I am so hot for you right now.
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here."
Rachel Green,So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rachel Green,And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Rachel Green,No?
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, Rosita? As in..."
Rachel Green,"Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?"
Rachel Green,Stevie the TV?
Rachel Green,"No! Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! You bitch!"
Rachel Green,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry."
Rachel Green,"Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair."
Rachel Green,"But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first."
Rachel Green,Okay? You ready?
Rachel Green,You will like it!
Rachel Green,You don't even know!
Rachel Green,"Well look, if you don't like this..."
Rachel Green,"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette."
Rachel Green,"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?"
Rachel Green,That's weird.
Rachel Green,It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.
Rachel Green,"Joey, I really don't..."
Rachel Green,Well no.
Rachel Green,"No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!"
Rachel Green,"That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair."
Rachel Green,I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Rachel Green,"Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!"
Rachel Green,Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Rachel Green,Hey Chandler!
Rachel Green,"How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?"
Rachel Green,"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?"
Rachel Green,I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.
Rachel Green,"Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair..."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Ohhhhh. That's how it got fixed!
Rachel Green,Noo! Angels.
Rachel Green,What? Wh-hey!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!"
Rachel Green,"No Joe, no miracle."
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don't get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! No I take that back!"
Rachel Green,No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.
Rachel Green,"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!"
Rachel Green,We're the Cobras!
Rachel Green,Ahhhh....
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it."
Rachel Green,Good ones?
Rachel Green,"Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?"
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam."
Rachel Green,Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Rachel Green,"Look, y'know I know my life's going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who've accomplished so many other goals by the time they're thirty."
Rachel Green,There you go!
Rachel Green,"Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!"
Rachel Green,Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Rachel Green,"Really! God Ross, what were you thinking? I know it's really shallow, but a part of me wants him again."
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? I am going to do something today. I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I'm gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something."
Rachel Green,So what?! Y'know what? The way I see it--Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Rachel Green,"Get out, get out of my apartment."
Rachel Green,Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!
Rachel Green,What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!
Rachel Green,"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey."
Rachel Green,Ahh!
Rachel Green,A scooter!
Rachel Green,"No! No-no, I love it. Thank you."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Happy birthday Grandma! It's better to be over the hill then buried under it. All our love Monica and Chandler. That's funny, yeah!"
Rachel Green,"No, I know! I get it! It's funny!"
Rachel Green,"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny."
Rachel Green,"Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids."
Rachel Green,Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...
Rachel Green,As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Rachel Green,"So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant..."
Rachel Green,"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty."
Rachel Green,"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!"
Rachel Green,I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Rachel Green,"Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs."
Rachel Green,"Ross, I really don't think..."
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, can I..."
Rachel Green,"Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag."
Rachel Green,"Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother."
Rachel Green,Not in the street!!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm um...let's talk."
Rachel Green,Umm...
Rachel Green,"Ohh Tag, umm...you're such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don't-I don't..."
Rachel Green,"Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I'm past the point where I think I can y'know, just have fun."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it is! But you're just a kid! I mean you're 25!"
Rachel Green,"Oh God! Y'know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I'm wishin' for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,"Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?"
Rachel Green,Ohh...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it's just y'know..."
Rachel Green,Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Rachel Green,It'll be a short one.
Rachel Green,Ohhh...
Rachel Green,"Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?"
Rachel Green,"She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage."
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress."
Rachel Green,"Well, I'd have to say gay."
Rachel Green,Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Rachel Green,"All right, straight, and not subtle."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found."
Rachel Green,"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age."
Rachel Green,What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again."
Rachel Green,Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Rachel Green,"Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!"
Rachel Green,"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone."
Rachel Green,I don't think so.
Rachel Green,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom."
Rachel Green,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin."
Rachel Green,Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial."
Rachel Green,His new girlfriend!
Rachel Green,Hi Pheebs!
Rachel Green,How are ya?
Rachel Green,"Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?"
Rachel Green,And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Rachel Green,And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Rachel Green,You stole the phone!
Rachel Green,"No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?"
Rachel Green,"Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!"
Rachel Green,Phoebe!
Rachel Green,"Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
Rachel Green,Phoebe! You can't do th...
Rachel Green,You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Rachel Green,You just said it!
Rachel Green,Oh Phoebe!
Rachel Green,Ohh!
Rachel Green,Hey! Hey!
Rachel Green,Well why shouldn't I?!
Rachel Green,"Well, then I get to give him the cell phone."
Rachel Green,You're not the man who left the cell phone.
Rachel Green,Is-is he coming?
Rachel Green,We'll be right back sir.
Rachel Green,I don't know!
Rachel Green,I know! What?!
Rachel Green,"No-no they do but, you just have to wait."
Rachel Green,"All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!"
Rachel Green,Ohh...
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!"
Rachel Green,MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
Rachel Green,"God. You seem really, really nice."
Rachel Green,I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.

Rachel Green,I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,Hi! Hi Ben!
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah go ahead."
Rachel Green,No. No.
Rachel Green,"Ben, its Rachel! But whatever."
Rachel Green,"Awww, just like his daddy."
Rachel Green,What-what about Monica?
Rachel Green,"So it would just be, me alone?"
Rachel Green,Huh umm...
Rachel Green,"Well that-y'know it's just uh, I've never done that before. Me and him alone."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Yeah I think so.
Rachel Green,"Bye. Ahhh... So this is fun, huh?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?"
Rachel Green,Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Rachel Green,Okay. Well that's pretty much all that we have-Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Rachel Green,Water it is.
Rachel Green,"Ben y'know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. 'Cause I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend."
Rachel Green,"No, I'm not."
Rachel Green,"Hey! We were not on a-Okay. That's fine! Fine. Y'know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?"
Rachel Green,"Fifty-two minutes. So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don't have to share stuff."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you're one of those. But y'know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other."
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they'd put salt on their cereal."
Rachel Green,Yeah? You like that one?
Rachel Green,"I'm funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I've got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear-Do you want a good one? Here's a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? And then you say to person, I bet you can't roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I-I-I-I'm funny Ben, but I'm not stupid. Okay?"
Rachel Green,Coming.
Rachel Green,Uh-oh.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah? Did he pull the old...
Rachel Green,Oh that.
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don't think that's just a little funny?!"
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, ""What's up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"""
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"I'd love that. I would loooove... So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little..."
Rachel Green,"I found him! Very funny, come here! That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you okay?"
Rachel Green,"Yes oh--Do I want sugar in my coffee? No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"
Rachel Green,Don't do that.
Rachel Green,"Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks."
Rachel Green,Oh damnit!
Rachel Green,No! Don't say that! Don't say that!
Rachel Green,No don't! Go back to repeating!
Rachel Green,Oh crap!
Rachel Green,So now what have we agreed?
Rachel Green,And-and what else?
Rachel Green,Very good.
Rachel Green,I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Carol...Lesbian?
Rachel Green,What line?
Rachel Green,"All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you but you were so mad already!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, maybe they are not funny to you..."
Rachel Green,Or Carol! But they're funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Rachel Green,"That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, ""I will be revenged?!"""
Rachel Green,"Fine. Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!"
Rachel Green,"Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!"
Rachel Green,I gotta go!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don't we Ben?"
Rachel Green,"Ohh, okay. Wh-Ah-ha! Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can't do it."
Rachel Green,"I can't let him go out that way, he's got a meeting. You've got something here on your back."
Rachel Green,Oh I...
Rachel Green,No! Wait! Come on!
Rachel Green,No you guys...
Rachel Green,EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Rachel Green,I do the same thing.
Rachel Green,I'm just kidding too. I'm getting married in December.
Rachel Green,Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
Rachel Green,"So, does this come in another color or..."
Rachel Green,So this is Brooklyn.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Oh they're pushing! They're pushing!!
Rachel Green,Well I...
Rachel Green,No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Rachel Green,No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Rachel Green,Hey...
Rachel Green,You're out of Diet Coke.
Rachel Green,You're out of toilet paper!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced."
Rachel Green,"Well, what is the other reason?"
Rachel Green,Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Rachel Green,"Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
Rachel Green,No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Rachel Green,I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Rachel Green,"What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Grammy, Best New Artist."
Rachel Green,Ohh that's great!
Rachel Green,"So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win."
Rachel Green,"Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation."
Rachel Green,"Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like..."
Rachel Green,Y'know?
Rachel Green,"Oh no, at the Grammies I always win."
Rachel Green,Whoa what?
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Not right now.
Rachel Green,"Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you-I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,I didn't. I got under him.
Rachel Green,I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Rachel Green,Do you got your gracious loser face?
Rachel Green,"Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!"
Rachel Green,On TV?! Yeah!
Rachel Green,Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God you stole her award!
Rachel Green,Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
Rachel Green,"Joey, you have got to take this back!"
Rachel Green,No! Joey!
Rachel Green,Do you really want an award you didn't win?
Rachel Green,Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Rachel Green,"Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something."
Rachel Green,All right? Thank you.
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'm totally cool!"
Rachel Green,Hey Jess.
Rachel Green,'Sup?
Rachel Green,Absolutely.

Rachel Green,"Okay honey, you can finish this later we're gonna be late. We gotta go."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?"
Rachel Green,Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Rachel Green,She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday...
Rachel Green,Yesterday!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!"
Rachel Green,"Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right."
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I already, I already did."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?"
Rachel Green,4 o'clock. Food?
Rachel Green,Ooh great! Very Monica.
Rachel Green,"Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?"
Rachel Green,We're paying for this y'know.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list."
Rachel Green,Hey! What's up Mon?
Rachel Green,Have at it.
Rachel Green,Are you makin' him a sandwich?
Rachel Green,We have to get her a present?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice."
Rachel Green,Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Rachel Green,Ohhhh!
Rachel Green,That's great!
Rachel Green,Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
Rachel Green,No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Rachel Green,Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Rachel Green,"Oh Monica, we are so sorry."
Rachel Green,"Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either."
Rachel Green,Ugh...
Rachel Green,"What do you, what do you mean?"
Rachel Green,Surprise...
Rachel Green,...Monica.
Rachel Green,"Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don't think I have the energy for this."
Rachel Green,Melissa!
Rachel Green,Wh--Why don't I tell you over here?
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no, no! It's good! It's all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!"
Rachel Green,I will not! I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear!
Rachel Green,Oh please...
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Oh tomorrow, oh I don't know. Um..."
Rachel Green,Shut up.
Rachel Green,"Oh, wow thanks! Oh you're in real estate!"
Rachel Green,Wow! What do you do now?
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Rachel Green,She's actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,It's not a big deal!
Rachel Green,"No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit."
Rachel Green,"Oh wow. Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. These pins aren't for playing are they?"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Stop picturing it!!
Rachel Green,That is not a problem.
Rachel Green,"Oh, get out of here!"
Rachel Green,"So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved."
Rachel Green,I'm Monica's maid of honor. Okay? Don't try to blue pin me!
Rachel Green,Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
Rachel Green,Some of them.
Rachel Green,"Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?"
Rachel Green,"Umm, well let's see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw."
Rachel Green,This one is uh Paul O'Neil.
Rachel Green,"He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!"
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,It's a pretty cool tux.
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?"
Rachel Green,"Well, what are you going to wear?"
Rachel Green,Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Rachel Green,Can I please be there when you tell her?
Rachel Green,"Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl."
Rachel Green,"Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time...she and I y'know...kissed a little bit."
Rachel Green,It-it did!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!"
Rachel Green,I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian! I'm just saying that this happened!
Rachel Green,Vanilla?!
Rachel Green,I'm not vanilla! I've done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Rachel Green,"All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me about this, why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you."
Rachel Green,"Oh. Oh, that's great!"
Rachel Green,"Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin' Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out."
Rachel Green,"Remember?! We-come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops..."
Rachel Green,...we went back the house and we got really silly and we...we made out.
Rachel Green,How can you not remember us kissing?!
Rachel Green,Wh... Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn't stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin' together?
Rachel Green,"Yeah-but come on-Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn't believe me."
Rachel Green,No!!
Rachel Green,Thank you Phoebe.
Rachel Green,It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Rachel Green,"What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you will remember this!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Rachel Green,I-I-I-I'm just...I'm just a good kisser!
Rachel Green,I'm sorry!
Rachel Green,Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna...
Rachel Green,What the hell was that?!
Rachel Green,And?
Rachel Green,"Well y'know what they say, the 23rd time's the charm. Aww, look at you all handsome!"
Rachel Green,Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Rachel Green,I don't want to say.
Rachel Green,Diane Keeton.
Rachel Green,Monica what?
Rachel Green,What is the emergency?!
Rachel Green,"Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, ""Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."""
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, sometimes that helps."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
Rachel Green,I can't believe they've been together for three years.
Rachel Green,I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
Rachel Green,Arghh!!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,OH MY GOD!!!
Rachel Green,Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Rachel Green,I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Rachel Green,"Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!"
Rachel Green,HI!! Hi!
Rachel Green,"Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!"
Rachel Green,"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie."
Rachel Green,Are you kidding?!
Rachel Green,"I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?"
Rachel Green,Joey!
Rachel Green,"Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!"
Rachel Green,"Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open."
Rachel Green,Okay!
Rachel Green,You really think it would be that different?
Rachel Green,"Well, things change."
Rachel Green,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
Rachel Green,"Aww, look at the little thing."
Rachel Green,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
Rachel Green,"Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is."
Rachel Green,"Oh, can we read them?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Monica, will-will you marry me?"
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it."
Rachel Green,You let Joey drive it?!
Rachel Green,Wow! I can't believe you lied to me.
Rachel Green,Take the top down did ya?
Rachel Green,Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she's talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Rachel Green,"Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader."
Rachel Green,I think she's checking out your beehive Ross.
Rachel Green,Gimme the keys!
Rachel Green,Well no brush!
Rachel Green,Alimony.
Rachel Green,"Ahhh! Ooh, nice!"
Rachel Green,My God!
Rachel Green,Just washing the windshield.
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Look Ross, if you're so freaked out, just get in the car!"
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Rachel Green,Oh my...
Rachel Green,God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Rachel Green,Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax...
Rachel Green,I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Rachel Green,Uh-oh.
Rachel Green,Really? You think so?
Rachel Green,"Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over!"
Rachel Green,Oh come on Ross!!
Rachel Green,"Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?"
Rachel Green,"Oh yes, absolutely! Y'know, it's weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh...well I probably shouldn't tell you the rest."
Rachel Green,"Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome."
Rachel Green,"Oops sorry, my mistake."
Rachel Green,"Really?! You think so? Y'know, I had just rolled out of bed."
Rachel Green,Y'know you're-you're probably wondering about the old date on there.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,I bet you're a Gemini.
Rachel Green,Taurus?
Rachel Green,Virgo?
Rachel Green,Sagittarius?
Rachel Green,"I knew it! I knew it, ahh...."
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,I won't speed.
Rachel Green,I promise.
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Oh well...
Rachel Green,Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Rachel Green,Fourth gear!!
Rachel Green,Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o'clock position.
Rachel Green,It's a different guy!
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,You have a son!
Rachel Green,Op! We gotta go!
Rachel Green,What 'cha doing Mon?
Rachel Green,Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
Rachel Green,The commercial?
Rachel Green,Oh that's great!
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I."
Rachel Green,You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
Rachel Green,Mexico?
Rachel Green,Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful!
Rachel Green,Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!
Rachel Green,Man in the black dress... Hi! I'm Rachel! I'm a friend of Monica and Chandler's!
Rachel Green,Oh I get it! A...man...duh!
Rachel Green,I'll do it.
Rachel Green,I said I'll do it!
Rachel Green,Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
Rachel Green,Well of course that is what I'm here for!
Rachel Green,Ugh! What grandmother?
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Tell Monica I'm sorry.
Rachel Green,"Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
Rachel Green,Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Rachel Green,"God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown..."
Rachel Green,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
Rachel Green,I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
Rachel Green,Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, ""Oh that poor girl."" Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night."
Rachel Green,"Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this."
Rachel Green,Okay?
Rachel Green,No. Why?
Rachel Green,Anything?
Rachel Green,"All right, we've got to tell her he's gone."
Rachel Green,"Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!"
Rachel Green,"All right, well how much time do you need?"
Rachel Green,One hour.
Rachel Green,Then why do you ask?!
Rachel Green,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
Rachel Green,I'll figure something out.
Rachel Green,Thanks.
Rachel Green,"Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me."
Rachel Green,Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
Rachel Green,"No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something."
Rachel Green,Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel Green,The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...
Rachel Green,I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
Rachel Green,Okay. But wait!
Rachel Green,Let's go to lunch.
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,Oh good God! I've fallen down!
Rachel Green,"Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you."
Rachel Green,We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,You look so beautiful.
Rachel Green,Hello?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine."
Rachel Green,What? Why? Where are you?
Rachel Green,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
Rachel Green,"Ugh! Joey, I have to go."
Rachel Green,"Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus."
Rachel Green,As are you...
Rachel Green,Go on! Go on.
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, who is it?!"
Rachel Green,For you.
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet."
Rachel Green,"You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you."
Rachel Green,Oh yeah.
Rachel Green,Oh! Oh by the way?
Rachel Green,James Brolin?
Rachel Green,Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Ugh! Look honey y'know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else."
Rachel Green,Phoebe!!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him."
Rachel Green,Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
Rachel Green,"Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Hey! Y'know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they're supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!"
Rachel Green,I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave."
Rachel Green,Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
Rachel Green,I don't know.
Rachel Green,Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Rachel Green,Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
Rachel Green,I don't know. I don't know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,How many ways are there to do that?
Rachel Green,"All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home."
Rachel Green,Okay. Thank you.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you guys are so great."
Rachel Green,"Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick."
Rachel Green,How much longer?
Rachel Green,"30 seconds, okay."
Rachel Green,Oh I know. I know.
Rachel Green,"Oh wait! Y'know what? I can't, I can't look at it. I can't. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! That is-that's great-that is really great-great news. Y'know 'cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. God."
Rachel Green,Thanks. God this is so stupid! How could I be upset over something I never had? It's negative?
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Are you sure?
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh, that's a risky little game!"
Rachel Green,Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby. I'm gonna have a baby!
Rachel Green,"Ah, it's still not the time."
Rachel Green,"Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!"
Rachel Green,Are you joking? Check out is not 'til noon and he has a good eleven minutes left.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y'know, he screamed out Radisson at the end."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Shh-shh-shh! The guys don't know yet do they?
Rachel Green,"Don't worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, 'cause I'm going to tell the father today."
Rachel Green,Ew! No!
Rachel Green,Well then you have his baby.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news."
Rachel Green,"Well it's only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I'm not gonna ask him for anything."
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?"
Rachel Green,"Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!"
Rachel Green,Not yet.
Rachel Green,"No! Phoebe, it's not Gunther."
Rachel Green,Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven't told him yet and I don't think I can tell him at all now!
Rachel Green,"I don't know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, 'I'm gonna tell the father today' and then bam!"
Rachel Green,"No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!"
Rachel Green,"I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn't even go to how huge this was going to be for the father."
Rachel Green,"What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?"
Rachel Green,"Oh God... Oh, he's in there right now?"
Rachel Green,"Uh, let's rip!"
Rachel Green,Oh Phoebe!
Rachel Green,"Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y'know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's just not the right time."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Tag...
Rachel Green,I'm having a baby.
Rachel Green,You can go.
Rachel Green,Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra!"
Rachel Green,"No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight."
Rachel Green,I'm not?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband."
Rachel Green,"Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down."
Rachel Green,Oh good you're still here!
Rachel Green,I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon!
Rachel Green,And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today. What? What? What?
Rachel Green,How?! How do you know?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I'm so relieved you guys know."
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Rachel Green,Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I'm gonna tell Ross!
Rachel Green,Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
Rachel Green,"Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what's-what's the first thing that I say? Okay great! Thanks."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Hi. Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about."
Rachel Green,You do?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Seriously. What?!
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?"
Rachel Green,"I'm pregnant. Ross? Ross? Okay, whenever you're ready. And you're the father by the way-but you got that..."
Rachel Green,Can I get you some water?
Rachel Green,"Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want."
Rachel Green,"I know. I know, but y'know condoms only work like 97% of the time."
Rachel Green,They do!
Rachel Green,Okay Ross come on let's just forget about the condoms.
Rachel Green,"Listen, y'know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out..."
Rachel Green,"Y'know what? Let's, let's talk later."
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know maybe I should come back..."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"If I said I was, would you judge me?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn..."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I've kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here."
Rachel Green,"Okay Ross that's fine, but can you please stand near my head?"
Rachel Green,Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
Rachel Green,What married?
Rachel Green,"What, because that's your answer to everything?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, maybe if you're in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?"
Rachel Green,Excuse me?
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,I can too eat by myself!
Rachel Green,When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
Rachel Green,"Oh please, you inhale your food!"
Rachel Green,"Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father."
Rachel Green,I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Rachel Green,"Wow. There it is, I see it."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,I don't see it!
Rachel Green,I can't see it!
Rachel Green,"I know, I lied! I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can't even see my own baby!"
Rachel Green,"Oh. Oh, it's beautiful. I see it now."
Rachel Green,"No, I don't see it!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"That's it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you."
Rachel Green,Wow! I can't believe that's our baby.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh, everything went great."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I know I couldn't see it either at first, but it's right umm... Ross, I lost it again."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Welcome home.
Rachel Green,Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
Rachel Green,"Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey."
Rachel Green,"And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me."
Rachel Green,What is?
Rachel Green,That-that you came on to me?
Rachel Green,"But you did! I mean, let's be honest."
Rachel Green,You know you kissed me first.
Rachel Green,I was sending you signals?
Rachel Green,"Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands."
Rachel Green,"Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, 'cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?"
Rachel Green,"No please, show me how I begged you!"
Rachel Green,Oh Ross!
Rachel Green,Thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Rachel Green,Hey! Is Ross still here?
Rachel Green,"Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? Oh forget it! Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village."
Rachel Green,Thank you. What? You don't want to see this do you?
Rachel Green,I am not gonna show you this!
Rachel Green,I wanna see it.
Rachel Green,"Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?"
Rachel Green,"Ahh, I don't believe you. I think you don't want them to see you begging me."
Rachel Green,"Ah, a little preview!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, here we go."
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank God you're here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?"
Rachel Green,There I am.
Rachel Green,"I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I..."
Rachel Green,I-I know-I had put them in...in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
Rachel Green,Kinda hurtin' my hand though.
Rachel Green,"I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! ""Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"" Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh...oh-oh-oh..."
Rachel Green,Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would've gone through with it? Y'know, if we hadn't gotten caught. Do you think we would've done it?"
Rachel Green,Oh I wanted to.
Rachel Green,Interesting.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, sure."
Rachel Green,"Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me."
Rachel Green,Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
Rachel Green,"Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,What are you talking about?!
Rachel Green,How do you know about that story?!
Rachel Green,I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Rachel Green,"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams."
Rachel Green,"So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?"
Rachel Green,It was an amazing night.
Rachel Green,You think it looked amazing?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, me neither. Yet..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it would be really weird."
Rachel Green,Good luck to you.
Rachel Green,Oh please.
Rachel Green,You are undressing very quickly.
Rachel Green,Ah. Oh.
Rachel Green,That's what I was gonna say.
Rachel Green,Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Rachel Green,Have you been working out?
Rachel Green,"Really? Wow, this is so much better than I..."
Rachel Green,Ohh! Ew!
Rachel Green,Oh! Oh!
Rachel Green,Oh God!
Rachel Green,"Oh, make it stop!"
Rachel Green,Make it stop!!
Rachel Green,Have to make it stop!!
Rachel Green,Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!
Rachel Green,You don't know do you?
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm."
Rachel Green,"Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash."
Rachel Green,Say hi to Wally.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,I thought I was a complete idiot.
Rachel Green,"Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
Rachel Green,"Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"""
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I can't. I got a date."
Rachel Green,Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Rachel Green,Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!
Rachel Green,Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
Rachel Green,"Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later."
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?"
Rachel Green,I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Rachel Green,"Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want."
Rachel Green,"He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, ""Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."""
Rachel Green,Doesn't he?
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Chandler M. Bing?
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
Rachel Green,Thanks sweetie.
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars."
Rachel Green,"Oh you did, there are twenty in here."
Rachel Green,Good night.
Rachel Green,Please tell me you're not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won't be able to fit into it."
Rachel Green,Ahh!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y'know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts."
Rachel Green,Just a minute!!! Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch.
Rachel Green,And you are a very funny clown.
Rachel Green,"And you are so in style right now. Y'know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but..."
Rachel Green,Yeah. Sure.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you did this to him?"
Rachel Green,Oh! Well you're just the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.
Rachel Green,Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Rachel Green,"Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy."
Rachel Green,"Ohh... Oh, honey here. Take it all. Monica! We need more candy?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Hi! Y'know what honey, we're actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I'm out of that too. Hey, can I write you a check?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, what's your name?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to cash."
Rachel Green,Hey Mona!
Rachel Green,Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
Rachel Green,"Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world."
Rachel Green,Gotta go! Hi! Wow! There you go!
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we've got candy."
Rachel Green,"Well, that-that's not your choice. Happy Halloween!"
Rachel Green,Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
Rachel Green,You shut up!
Rachel Green,"Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah I know-I'm good-I got it! Now wait a minute, I've got one more thing I have to say to you...oh right! Shut up!"
Rachel Green,No! Wait no! Shut up-I mean don't cry! Let me get my checkbook!
Rachel Green,"Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying."
Rachel Green,"No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!"
Rachel Green,Really? You think that's all it is?
Rachel Green,Wow! What did he do?
Rachel Green,I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, ""How you doin'?"""
Rachel Green,"Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book."
Rachel Green,Not so much.
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Rachel Green,Yeah that would really be great.
Rachel Green,Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
Rachel Green,Shall we?
Rachel Green,"And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building."
Rachel Green,Ahh.
Rachel Green,So she's really not dead.
Rachel Green,"Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,How was the game?
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
Rachel Green,"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here."
Rachel Green,"Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around."
Rachel Green,"Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life."
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,I do too a little bit.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,You gave them to me!
Rachel Green,"All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch."
Rachel Green,What bra?
Rachel Green,You mean the one that you're wearing?
Rachel Green,What is this?
Rachel Green,You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
Rachel Green,"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud."
Rachel Green,It's gonna be up all night!
Rachel Green,It's gonna poop!
Rachel Green,What about all the women you want to bring home?
Rachel Green,"Joey, are you sure?"
Rachel Green,I want me to stay too.
Rachel Green,Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
Rachel Green,Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
Rachel Green,Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
Rachel Green,It's moving.
Rachel Green,It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Rachel Green,Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
Rachel Green,Hey Pheebs?
Rachel Green,"I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?"
Rachel Green,"Oh no, no, I'll be there too."
Rachel Green,No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
Rachel Green,'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
Rachel Green,What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,No you don't.
Rachel Green,Well you could've untied it with your hands.
Rachel Green,Well actually umm...
Rachel Green,"In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man."
Rachel Green,"This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't..."
Rachel Green,"No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him."
Rachel Green,"Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?"
Rachel Green,"Well... Umm, I got TiVo."
Rachel Green,Phoebe!
Rachel Green,"Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah."
Rachel Green,"No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Who?
Rachel Green,February 2nd!
Rachel Green,"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour."
Rachel Green,"All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong."
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down."
Rachel Green,There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Rachel Green,I'm sorry daddy.
Rachel Green,"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please."
Rachel Green,"Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods."
Rachel Green,Oh no...
Rachel Green,"Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail."
Rachel Green,"Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?"
Rachel Green,"All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Um...But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together."
Rachel Green,Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
Rachel Green,"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!"
Rachel Green,"Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is."
Rachel Green,"I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now."
Rachel Green,"Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!"
Rachel Green,About an hour ago.
Rachel Green,Yes! Bye daddy.
Rachel Green,Oh my...God! Let me see that!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!"
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend."
Rachel Green,Oh that's nice.
Rachel Green,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh my God Monica, who is that?"
Rachel Green,"Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. Oh my God, he's... Look at the way he's just staring at me. I think he's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Will, right?"
Rachel Green,Hi! I'm Rachel Green.
Rachel Green,"Really?! Aren't you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?"
Rachel Green,Thank you!
Rachel Green,"All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?"
Rachel Green,What? Oh y'know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
Rachel Green,I'm sorry. What?
Rachel Green,"Umm, I'm sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?"
Rachel Green,I'm-I'm-I had no idea. I'm sorry. I...
Rachel Green,"Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I'm real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school..."
Rachel Green,You had a club?!
Rachel Green,"Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?"
Rachel Green,So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
Rachel Green,So who else was in this club?
Rachel Green,"So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club."
Rachel Green,"Okay Monica, did you know about this?!"
Rachel Green,Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
Rachel Green,What rumor?
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,What?! You heard that?!
Rachel Green,Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
Rachel Green,"Monica, how come you never told me this?!"
Rachel Green,Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, ""Dear Rach, you're such a good person."" Not girl! Person!"
Rachel Green,"""Dear Rach, you're a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."""
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Rachel Green,"Ohh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually."
Rachel Green,Wh-Phoebe!!
Rachel Green,"All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!"
Rachel Green,Wow...
Rachel Green,She's right.
Rachel Green,You can keep those pants by the way.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Rachel Green,Return them?! Shh! They're gonna hear you!
Rachel Green,He's talking to the baby.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I'll see you later."
Rachel Green,Bye.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste."
Rachel Green,I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...
Rachel Green,Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!
Rachel Green,Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Hi Monica!
Rachel Green,Hi boots.
Rachel Green,Ahh...
Rachel Green,Well-well you can give them to me! I haven't felt my feet in years!
Rachel Green,"Oh Joey, I'm hardly a..."
Rachel Green,Right! Hi Dina!
Rachel Green,Nice to meet you.
Rachel Green,"Okay. All right Dina, well let's talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let's see, there's design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there's-there's sales, which is great because you get to travel..."
Rachel Green,And there's marketing...
Rachel Green,"Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you."
Rachel Green,Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?
Rachel Green,Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Rachel Green,What?! Dina...
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,What college was that Dina?
Rachel Green,"Joey, what are you doing?"
Rachel Green,Oh Joey this is crazy!
Rachel Green,"All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!"
Rachel Green,You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Rachel Green,Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on kids! A little help here!"
Rachel Green,"Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Rachel Green,So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Rachel Green,"Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment."
Rachel Green,No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!
Rachel Green,
Rachel Green,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Really?! So this has happened to you?
Rachel Green,"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap."
Rachel Green,Ah.
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers..."
Rachel Green,"Yes, you are."
Rachel Green,"Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?"
Rachel Green,"Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!"
Rachel Green,No. I'm very comfortable.
Rachel Green,"No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!"
Rachel Green,Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Rachel Green,Do you feel it too?
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Well, let's see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple."
Rachel Green,"Okay, even this is turning me on!"
Rachel Green,"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?"
Rachel Green,Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Rachel Green,"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater."
Rachel Green,You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Phoebe no!
Rachel Green,"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!"
Rachel Green,"Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. I'll call you back."
Rachel Green,It's just the pizza place.
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day."
Rachel Green,"Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it."
Rachel Green,"Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself...how do I put this umm, erotically charged."
Rachel Green,"Yeah. So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y'know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so...hard...to find. So how was your day?"
Rachel Green,"Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock."
Rachel Green,"Okay, good night!"
Rachel Green,I didn't ask you to do it!
Rachel Green,You're Joey!
Rachel Green,Right back at ya!
Rachel Green,And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
Rachel Green,No!
Rachel Green,That's the end of this conversation!
Rachel Green,Never happened! Good night!
Rachel Green,They made you head of the department!
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing-Oh! Take her dancing!"
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun."
Rachel Green,Huh?
Rachel Green,"What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady."
Rachel Green,Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
Rachel Green,All right?
Rachel Green,Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Rachel Green,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you."
Rachel Green,"Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, actually that's my roommate's."
Rachel Green,"Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself."
Rachel Green,Hm-mmm.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay."
Rachel Green,"Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?"
Rachel Green,"Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?"
Rachel Green,"Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date-Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check."
Rachel Green,Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
Rachel Green,I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Rachel Green,Oh my God. And that works?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, you poor little famous man."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!"
Rachel Green,Alright. So where'd you grow up?
Rachel Green,"Come on, just answer the question!"
Rachel Green,And so were-were you close to your parents?
Rachel Green,Why not?
Rachel Green,Oh. It's gotta be rough.
Rachel Green,Huh?
Rachel Green,"Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room."
Rachel Green,And now you're watching me walk away.
Rachel Green,I am not gonna answer that!
Rachel Green,"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!"
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose."
Rachel Green,Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Rachel Green,"All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan."
Rachel Green,"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?"
Rachel Green,How do you do that?
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"No, I don't want to tell you."
Rachel Green,Because it's embarrassing.
Rachel Green,"Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works."
Rachel Green,"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time."
Rachel Green,"...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!"
Rachel Green,"Well, why didn't you just take a cab?"
Rachel Green,Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Rachel Green,You what?
Rachel Green,Right. Wow!
Rachel Green,"Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?"
Rachel Green,Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
Rachel Green,"Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime."
Rachel Green,Well don't you have that big date tonight?
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, can I ask you something?"
Rachel Green,"After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?"
Rachel Green,I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night."
Rachel Green,Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
Rachel Green,Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
Rachel Green,Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Rachel Green,"No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?"
Rachel Green,Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Rachel Green,"Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me."
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?"
Rachel Green,"Hi, sweetie."
Rachel Green,"Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!"
Rachel Green,Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Rachel Green,Popular.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!
Rachel Green,Really?!
Rachel Green,"Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French."
Rachel Green,"Okay fine, what do you have?"
Rachel Green,"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard."
Rachel Green,"I'm really, really not."
Rachel Green,All right.
Rachel Green,"Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain."
Rachel Green,Why?
Rachel Green,"Ross, why do you hate our child?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, James."
Rachel Green,But only if it's a girl.
Rachel Green,Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Rachel Green,Veto. Sawyer?
Rachel Green,Veto.
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!"
Rachel Green,But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
Rachel Green,Right. Right.
Rachel Green,"So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?"
Rachel Green,Third one from the left?
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,I didn't!
Rachel Green,"Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear."
Rachel Green,"Okay, but Ross just listen to me..."
Rachel Green,"But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse."
Rachel Green,"Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross."
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
Rachel Green,I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Rachel Green,I would-Sequoia?
Rachel Green,Fine.
Rachel Green,"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Ross, I swear, I don't know."
Rachel Green,A what?!
Rachel Green,We're having a girl?
Rachel Green,That's what you just said!
Rachel Green,You said girl!
Rachel Green,I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!
Rachel Green,"Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth..."
Rachel Green,"Yes, please."
Rachel Green,"Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!"
Rachel Green,"No, I was waiting for you!"
Rachel Green,We're having a girl.
Rachel Green,"Hi, sweetie."
Rachel Green,"Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much."
Rachel Green,"And I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this but, you're the best sex I ever had."
Rachel Green,Joey! Joey!
Rachel Green,Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Rachel Green,Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Rachel Green,Yes!
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay!"
Rachel Green,"Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?"
Rachel Green,Mia Hamm!
Rachel Green,Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Rachel Green,It's not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do that again.
Rachel Green,Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...
Rachel Green,"Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!"
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Okay. Oh God-Ow!-Oo!
Rachel Green,"Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?"
Rachel Green,Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
Rachel Green,But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Rachel Green,But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!
Rachel Green,"Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, everything's fine!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, no uterus, no opinion."
Rachel Green,Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I gotta go back in there."
Rachel Green,"No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back..."
Rachel Green,I-I forgot my underwear.
Rachel Green,Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Rachel Green,Ohh! That's so sweet of you! Oh yum! Did you put pickles on this?
Rachel Green,Oh Ross!!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?"
Rachel Green,"Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna."
Rachel Green,What's up?
Rachel Green,Are you breaking up with us?
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Rachel Green,"But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does."
Rachel Green,"But Ross, its you and me!"
Rachel Green,I don't know. Is it crazy?
Rachel Green,"Okay, let's do it. I'll move in."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!"
Rachel Green,"It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together."
Rachel Green,Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
Rachel Green,"Oh, hey, Mona!"
Rachel Green,I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
Rachel Green,I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
Rachel Green,"You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!"
Rachel Green,I'm just going to grab the phone.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?"
Rachel Green,"But, but, Mona, I live here."
Rachel Green,"Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross."
Rachel Green,Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Rachel Green,"Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me."
Rachel Green,"C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!"
Rachel Green,Uh! It's horrible!
Rachel Green,"Oh, my God!"
Rachel Green,What? Did her ass explode?!
Rachel Green,"Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!"
Rachel Green,"You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!"
Rachel Green,Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!"
Rachel Green,Whoa!!
Rachel Green,Wow that was a big one.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.
Rachel Green,"Well, what's he like?!"
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Of course, of course."
Rachel Green,Oh sure. Older?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I was just gonna ask!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet."
Rachel Green,Joey? What's up?
Rachel Green,Okay what's up?
Rachel Green,"Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?"
Rachel Green,Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
Rachel Green,...and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. Are you okay?
Rachel Green,"No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Rachel Green,"Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much."
Rachel Green,"Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,So you were saying?
Rachel Green,"Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, ""Eight years."" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Who are you talking too? Oh, you're kidding! Oh, it's a joke! It's funny. It's funny. I don't get it. Oh. Okay. Umm... I-I...uh, wow. Are you uh... How did umm... When?"
Rachel Green,"Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here."
Rachel Green,"Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I..."
Rachel Green,Joey.
Rachel Green,"No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!"
Rachel Green,Can I?
Rachel Green,Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...
Rachel Green,I'm so sorry.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, that was a real good one."
Rachel Green,Joey? Are you in there?
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,Is Joey here?
Rachel Green,"Well, at least you make each other laugh."
Rachel Green,"Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?"
Rachel Green,"Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?"
Rachel Green,"All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him."
Rachel Green,"Okay, I'm done. Do mine."
Rachel Green,Ah.
Rachel Green,"Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab."
Rachel Green,Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore."
Rachel Green,"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Rachel Green,Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I can do that."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
Rachel Green,Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and umm my baby."
Rachel Green,My boss wants to buy my baby!
Rachel Green,"I know I told you, it's a really big problem."
Rachel Green,Can you believe that?!
Rachel Green,That's what I told him!
Rachel Green,"Well I'll tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, ""Rachel, I want to buy your baby."""
Rachel Green,Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
Rachel Green,Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Rachel Green,Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Rachel Green,"Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay."
Rachel Green,"Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!"
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!"
Rachel Green,So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
Rachel Green,I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
Rachel Green,"Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!"
Rachel Green,"Well, she told me too!"
Rachel Green,Morning. You wanted to see me?
Rachel Green,Okay look Mr. Zelner...
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Oh God.
Rachel Green,"Well, as long as we are clear about that."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
Rachel Green,"Chandler, can you give us a minute?"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things..."
Rachel Green,"It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this."
Rachel Green,Yeah I know! I miss that.
Rachel Green,My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?"
Rachel Green,"I, uh, think you already are."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah I like him a lot."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, otherwise I'm not going."
Rachel Green,"This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?"
Rachel Green,Hmmm....
Rachel Green,Thank you...we're so excited!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area."
Rachel Green,"No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just...smile. We'll nod along."
Rachel Green,Hmmmm....
Rachel Green,Oh...
Rachel Green,Unbelievable!
Rachel Green,Open it! Open it! Open it!
Rachel Green,"But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular."
Rachel Green,"On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend."
Rachel Green,So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
Rachel Green,What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Rachel Green,"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic."
Rachel Green,"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns."
Rachel Green,"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it."
Rachel Green,"Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel."
Rachel Green,Oh yeah. That's a great story.
Rachel Green,Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Rachel Green,"And the ring, was the size of my fist !"
Rachel Green,"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible."
Rachel Green,It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Rachel Green,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"
Rachel Green,"That proposal, at the planetarium..."
Rachel Green,"Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?"
Rachel Green,"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too."
Rachel Green,Goodnight.
Rachel Green,I will think about it.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down."
Rachel Green,So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, don't listen to him. Please?"
Rachel Green,"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, I'd actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea."
Rachel Green,That is the Coast Guard.
Rachel Green,"It's a trifle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch. Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauted with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!"
Rachel Green,Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
Rachel Green,"Hey, come on now!"
Rachel Green,"Hi! I'm gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too. This might be Joey's baby , who knows? I'm just kidding-Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, that's gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I......I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives."
Rachel Green,You too!
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey! Sorry!"
Rachel Green,Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,I've never lived like this before.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Jill!"
Rachel Green,This is Chandler.
Rachel Green,And you know Monica and Ross!
Rachel Green,"And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey."
Rachel Green,Don't!!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Wow! I can't believe they didn't put it in the part where you said you didn't watch soap operas.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
Rachel Green,"What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! That's shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here."
Rachel Green,What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
Rachel Green,My God!
Rachel Green,So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Rachel Green,"Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!"
Rachel Green,I don't know.
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper."
Rachel Green,"Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca."
Rachel Green,"Well, however great she was I just can't afford that."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Wh-wh-what? What?
Rachel Green,Yes. Yes I do.
Rachel Green,Why did you invite my mother?!
Rachel Green,She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Rachel Green,"Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing."
Rachel Green,"What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?"
Rachel Green,"You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own."
Rachel Green,"But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this."
Rachel Green,He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Rachel Green,Wow!
Rachel Green,"Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! Wait a minute. That can't be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?"
Rachel Green,"Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!"
Rachel Green,"Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?"
Rachel Green,What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!"
Rachel Green,"Oh come--Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y'know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful."
Rachel Green,"Okay mommy, don't ever leave me."
Rachel Green,"So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?"
Rachel Green,"Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot. I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?"
Rachel Green,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all."
Rachel Green,No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
Rachel Green,Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
Rachel Green,I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
Rachel Green,Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Rachel Green,Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Rachel Green,I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Okay! I'm ready.
Rachel Green,"Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff."
Rachel Green,"Uh, put your elbow in it."
Rachel Green,"Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers."
Rachel Green,"Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!"
Rachel Green,A card! A card! I pick a card!
Rachel Green,"Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, ""There's no such thing as bad press."""
Rachel Green,I didn't write it.
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,I am freaking out!
Rachel Green,My due date is in one week!
Rachel Green,That is seven days!
Rachel Green,"No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!"
Rachel Green,I'm serious.
Rachel Green,Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little...
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!"
Rachel Green,"Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?"
Rachel Green,I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple."
Rachel Green,"Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored."
Rachel Green,Hi Pheebs!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore."
Rachel Green,"Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
Rachel Green,No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!
Rachel Green,Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
Rachel Green,"Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you."
Rachel Green,"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?"
Rachel Green,Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!
Rachel Green,"So you guys go, have a really good time."
Rachel Green,"So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun."
Rachel Green,"Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button."
Rachel Green,"Oh okay, I see what you're doing there."
Rachel Green,Hi! You're back from your date!
Rachel Green,"I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?"
Rachel Green,"Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table."
Rachel Green,"No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?"
Rachel Green,"Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!"
Rachel Green,"No! It's just that, Kate bothered me."
Rachel Green,There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Rachel Green,I don't want you to date her!
Rachel Green,"Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you."
Rachel Green,"No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.
Rachel Green,"Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm..."
Rachel Green,I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
Rachel Green,"Oh no-no-no-no, no!"
Rachel Green,No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Right!
Rachel Green,"Well obviously I won't be able to come, for those of you who haven't checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y'know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you've been during this time. I really couldn't have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant."
Rachel Green,"That's right, still no baby! Come on people! Please make some room!"
Rachel Green,You. Like you haven't done enough.
Rachel Green,God. I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Rachel Green,"Oh Phoebe, that's a great story. Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea? Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!"
Rachel Green,Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? 'Cause I'll do it.
Rachel Green,"They sent me home from work. They were like, ""Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby."" Well y'know what? Screw 'em! If they don't want me there, I'll just hang out with you guys."
Rachel Green,What-what about me?
Rachel Green,I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I'm pregnant you think I'm invisible.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I have to pee. If I don't come out in five minutes it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink."
Rachel Green,"All right, who's turn is it to help me get up!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy."
Rachel Green,In a minute!!!
Rachel Green,"All right, all right. Let's go!"
Rachel Green,"No, I'm fine."
Rachel Green,"Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable."
Rachel Green,Oh uh-uh pal! Don't call me mommy! It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
Rachel Green,Ross.
Rachel Green,Can I ask you something?
Rachel Green,When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
Rachel Green,...were you this irritating?
Rachel Green,Excuse me?!
Rachel Green,Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That's great!"
Rachel Green,"Hi Dr. Long, how are you?"
Rachel Green,She has the drugs!
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Eh, just a tad."
Rachel Green,"Well, we are ready to try anything."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Great! We will do all of those.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Rachel Green,"Well, there is one thing that we haven't tried, but someone thinks that, ""That will open up a can of worms."""
Rachel Green,Why? Why today?
Rachel Green,I'll take that bet.
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!"
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow's the day."
Rachel Green,Ross I-We tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Rachel Green,"I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you."
Rachel Green,"Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what's gonna work! It's doctor recommended!"
Rachel Green,"Oh come on Ross, we've done it before we'll do it again, it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy."
Rachel Green,Make love? What are you a girl?
Rachel Green,"But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y'know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know it. You're right. That's not sexy. Oh...Oh! Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. Oh God!"
Rachel Green,"Come on Ross! I'm miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,"Oh wow! What now Ross you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That's not enough... What are you doing?!"
Rachel Green,Oh God!
Rachel Green,Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
Rachel Green,Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"I didn't uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to..."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Yes, the hard part is truly over."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby."
Rachel Green,"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We , we asked for a private room."
Rachel Green,Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Rachel Green,Give her some money.
Rachel Green,"They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!"
Rachel Green,Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
Rachel Green,Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look."
Rachel Green,"Oh, okay."
Rachel Green,"Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill."
Rachel Green,Yeah well it looks great!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,How are you?
Rachel Green,Yeah it is.
Rachel Green,That's so sweet.
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I really don't want any--Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross..."
Rachel Green,Here comes another contraction.
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay."
Rachel Green,"No, I don't think we'll be doing that."
Rachel Green,Oh. Oh wait no.
Rachel Green,No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
Rachel Green,No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!"
Rachel Green,New people.
Rachel Green,They're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Rachel Green,"Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!"
Rachel Green,Ooh! Ow!!
Rachel Green,Ross.
Rachel Green,He's looking at me.
Rachel Green,"Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!"
Rachel Green,Yeah it was.
Rachel Green,"Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, y'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this!"
Rachel Green,Oh stupid metric system!
Rachel Green,Oh for the love of God!
Rachel Green,Oh come on!!
Rachel Green,"Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband he's a lawyer!"
Rachel Green,Go get back on that case honey!
Rachel Green,"Okay, well then bring her in."
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,I get it!
Rachel Green,Oh we-we didn't.
Rachel Green,Just tell me how.
Rachel Green,Oh hi.
Rachel Green,Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Rachel Green,Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
Rachel Green,Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Rachel Green,Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Rachel Green,3-2-1 oh!!
Rachel Green,"I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't."
Rachel Green,Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
Rachel Green,"Don't say, ""Oh my God!"" Oh my God what?"
Rachel Green,Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, I can't!"
Rachel Green,I can't!
Rachel Green,"I can't. Please, you do it for me."
Rachel Green,Are you okay?
Rachel Green,Oh God!
Rachel Green,"Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?"
Rachel Green,"Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny."
Rachel Green,"Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you."
Rachel Green,"No, not yet."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green."
Rachel Green,Hello baby girl.
Rachel Green,Here.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying."
Rachel Green,So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.
Rachel Green,I was reliving it.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it."
Rachel Green,"That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella."
Rachel Green,Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Rachel Green,Well what are we going to do?
Rachel Green,Well tell us! What are they?
Rachel Green,And if it's a girl?
Rachel Green,"Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!"
Rachel Green,Emma! See? I don't want it.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, but you love that name."
Rachel Green,Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm fine."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross."
Rachel Green,"Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!"
Rachel Green,Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Well... That's...y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the...the beginning of something."
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?"
Rachel Green,Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
Rachel Green,Right.
Rachel Green,"No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?"
Rachel Green,That's all right. And so it begins.
Rachel Green,Nothing.
Rachel Green,Really it's nothing. I'm just...
Rachel Green,I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Rachel Green,"Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs."
Rachel Green,"I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?"
Rachel Green,I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Rachel Green,Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
Rachel Green,"Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Joey.
Rachel Green,Oh my God. Okay.
Rachel Green,Joey.
Rachel Green,Oh my God. Okay.
Rachel Green,So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?
Rachel Green,Hey you.
Rachel Green,"Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too."
Rachel Green,"I know, I still need to talk to you."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,Uhh... I think I just got engaged.
Rachel Green,Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?
Rachel Green,And you really think this is a good idea?
Rachel Green,I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.
Rachel Green,Really?! Even Ross?
Rachel Green,I guess so.
Rachel Green,I can't say that I'm surprised.
Rachel Green,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?"
Rachel Green,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth."
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?"
Rachel Green,"Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?"
Rachel Green,It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!
Rachel Green,Hey. I need to tell you something.
Rachel Green,Joey asked me marry him.
Rachel Green,Joey proposed to me.
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I said yes."
Rachel Green,"I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much."
Rachel Green,Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
Rachel Green,Sure.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I mean whatever."
Rachel Green,"No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?"
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Surprised?
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,You didn't propose to me. Joey did.
Rachel Green,"Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did."
Rachel Green,Yes you did!
Rachel Green,Well then why did you give me a ring?
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did!"
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did!"
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did! And don't you say, ""No, I didn't!"""
Rachel Green,He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, what did happen?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but you said, ""Will you marry me?"""
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did!"
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!"
Rachel Green,"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!"
Rachel Green,You were gonna propose to me?
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,"She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, this feels weird."
Rachel Green,Wonderful weird.
Rachel Green,"Honey don't worry, it was my mistake."
Rachel Green,She's perfect.
Rachel Green,We really are.
Rachel Green,I know. I know. I've feeling.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, maybe."
Rachel Green,Wh-what's that?
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, what?"
Rachel Green,"Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! I'm not helping."
Rachel Green,That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
Rachel Green,Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Rachel Green,Ooooo!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Rachel Green,"Oh Ah! Oh my gosh there's something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think... Oh you guys I love it."
Rachel Green,He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Rachel Green,"Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up."
Rachel Green,"Oh great, the pacifiers?"

Rachel Green,"Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t..."
Rachel Green,Blueberry.

Rachel Green,I have to go to the bathroom.
Rachel Green,Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Rachel Green,You are the official baby crier stopper!
Rachel Green,You're never leaving the apartment!
Rachel Green,"That's your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here."
Rachel Green,Okay so listen I'm gonna go lay down.
Rachel Green,You know the book says that whenever she's sleeping I should be sleeping so...
Rachel Green,"Heeeeey, where have you been? What happened to you?"
Rachel Green,"Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?"
Rachel Green,You know what I really really want?
Rachel Green,"I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again."
Rachel Green,"I mean I got news for you mister, Emma? Not easy."
Rachel Green,No its really okay... Monica!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Do you have to go?
Rachel Green,Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Rachel Green,Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Rachel Green,Every time?
Rachel Green,"All right, I trust you."
Rachel Green,I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
Rachel Green,"Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!"
Rachel Green,Dr. Wiener.
Rachel Green,"Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!"
Rachel Green,"Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!"
Rachel Green,Hiccups.
Rachel Green,"Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?"
Rachel Green,Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Rachel Green,"What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot."
Rachel Green,"Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!"
Rachel Green,Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Rachel Green,"It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?"
Rachel Green,"We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it."
Rachel Green,Ross said he died.
Rachel Green,"Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died."
Rachel Green,Why? What was it?
Rachel Green,"Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good."
Rachel Green,I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
Rachel Green,"Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor."
Rachel Green,"Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here."
Rachel Green,Bye honey.
Rachel Green,Hello.
Rachel Green,Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Rachel Green,Nooooooooo!
Rachel Green,well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?
Rachel Green,man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.
Rachel Green,"Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice."
Rachel Green,yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.
Rachel Green,"what, how do we know, we never slept with you."
Rachel Green,"yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other."
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. Which one of us should go to dinner?"
Rachel Green,"Um, Mon, Chandler's not here."
Rachel Green,"Okay, well that's now the third sign that I should not leave Emma."
Rachel Green,"Well, let's see. The first one is: I don't want to. And, you know, I'm not going."
Rachel Green,She is?
Rachel Green,What about Monica.
Rachel Green,Ish. I just don't think I can bear it.
Rachel Green,Uch.
Rachel Green,Oh-A.
Rachel Green,You need to learn some new slang.
Rachel Green,What ... Oh!
Rachel Green,I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Rachel Green,No. Uch.
Rachel Green,"Alright, I can't, I can't wait that long. You have to do something-knock that door down!"
Rachel Green,What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Rachel Green,"Oh my god, I left the water running."
Rachel Green,"Ah, did I leave the stove on?"
Rachel Green,"Is the window open? Because if there's a window open, a bird could fly in there."
Rachel Green,Ubb.
Rachel Green,"Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true."
Rachel Green,"Och, god. Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch."
Rachel Green,"Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again."
Rachel Green,"Hey, hi, hi!"
Rachel Green,"We got locked out of the apartment, we ..."
Rachel Green,"N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do."
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!"
Rachel Green,"She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you."
Rachel Green,"Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?"
Rachel Green,"Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon."
Rachel Green,Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Rachel Green,"Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock."
Rachel Green,"N-no, Emma dropped her sock."
Rachel Green,"Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground."
Rachel Green,Could you please get her attention?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?"
Rachel Green,"So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her."
Rachel Green,"That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?"
Rachel Green,Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...
Rachel Green,Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Rachel Green,Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Rachel Green,"What, the blonde with no bra?"
Rachel Green,Okay...
Rachel Green,"Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
Rachel Green,Ross!
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's pretty."
Rachel Green,"Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed."
Rachel Green,"Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him..."
Rachel Green,"So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out."
Rachel Green,Why?
Rachel Green,Yes?
Rachel Green,Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.
Rachel Green,Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Rachel Green,Oh... Oh boy... Hi...
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just sooo beautiful."
Rachel Green,I can't... I can't hear it again.
Rachel Green,Yeah! Excuse me...
Rachel Green,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all."
Rachel Green,What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Rachel Green,Sandy made Madeleines.
Rachel Green,"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle."
Rachel Green,"Okay, what? What is too sensitive?"
Rachel Green,That was kind of rude!
Rachel Green,"You know, he was just doing his job..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on Ross..."
Rachel Green,Oh... That's true.
Rachel Green,"Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it."
Rachel Green,I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Rachel Green,YOU! You feel!
Rachel Green,"Oh, damn you Geller!"
Rachel Green,Huh ha ha!
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, she can't be herself."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: ""Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."""
Rachel Green,"Uh, he took the SAT's for me."
Rachel Green,"Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!"
Rachel Green,You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Rachel Green,"Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?"
Rachel Green,You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Rachel Green,owwwww...
Rachel Green,"Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo..."
Rachel Green,"Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that..."
Rachel Green,"Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider..."
Rachel Green,Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
Rachel Green,So fellas.
Rachel Green,fellas.
Rachel Green,has your girlfriend got the butt?
Rachel Green,So shake it!
Rachel Green,Shake it!
Rachel Green,Shake that nasty butt...
Rachel Green,"One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br..."
Rachel Green,Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Rachel Green,Who is it?
Rachel Green,Hide my rings.
Rachel Green,Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Rachel Green,Um... hi.
Rachel Green,Aw.
Rachel Green,I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Rachel Green,Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Rachel Green,"Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing."
Rachel Green,mh hmm..
Rachel Green,Uh.... its Emma.
Rachel Green,"Oh Amy, you remember Ross."
Rachel Green,Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD."
Rachel Green,God she is unbelievable.
Rachel Green,"Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush."
Rachel Green,What? What happened?
Rachel Green,"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?"
Rachel Green,Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Rachel Green,"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond."
Rachel Green,"Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that! Monica and Chandler's apartment."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon."
Rachel Green,Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Rachel Green,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby."
Rachel Green,"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby."
Rachel Green,Monica is Ross' sister.
Rachel Green,"Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this."
Rachel Green,Well actually...
Rachel Green,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent."
Rachel Green,UCHH!
Rachel Green,Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
Rachel Green,What? What carrer?
Rachel Green,Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
Rachel Green,Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
Rachel Green,I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
Rachel Green,Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.
Rachel Green,uh huh.
Rachel Green,"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?"
Rachel Green,Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Rachel Green,"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today."
Rachel Green,ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.
Rachel Green,You take that back.
Rachel Green,Take it back!
Rachel Green,"Heey man, I work out."
Rachel Green,I do pilates.
Rachel Green,Bring it on!
Rachel Green,Did you just push me?
Rachel Green,Alright. Thats it!
Rachel Green,Ew! Gross.
Rachel Green,"Mon, I'm so sorry."
Rachel Green,Are you okay Mon?
Rachel Green,"Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you.."
Rachel Green,Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
Rachel Green,She needs changing.
Rachel Green,"Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good."
Rachel Green,"Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way."
Rachel Green,Phoebe's Mike?
Rachel Green,I didn't know you guys hung out.
Rachel Green,"Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . ."
Rachel Green,Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.
Rachel Green,Oh God. It seems like forever ago.
Rachel Green,"Well, um . . . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing."
Rachel Green,"Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact."
Rachel Green,Mm-hmm.
Rachel Green,Oh. Should we send them something back?
Rachel Green,"No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here."
Rachel Green,"Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross."
Rachel Green,Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.
Rachel Green,That's my bubby!
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . ."
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, no."
Rachel Green,Oh sure.
Rachel Green,Great.
Rachel Green,"I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse."
Rachel Green,"No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. ""Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."""
Rachel Green,"""Yeah."" ""Me too."""
Rachel Green,"""Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."""
Rachel Green,"""Yeah."" ""Me neither."""
Rachel Green,"""Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"""
Rachel Green,"""Yeah. That works for me."""
Rachel Green,"Oh, thanks."
Rachel Green,Wha. . . hey!
Rachel Green,"Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life."
Rachel Green,I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
Rachel Green,"Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work."
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."
Rachel Green,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Rachel Green,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
Rachel Green,That's right!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"""Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."""
Rachel Green,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Rachel Green,"Oh Chandler, stop talking!"
Rachel Green,"Oohh, I love it!"
Rachel Green,"Well, not this second!"
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, it's so beautiful..."
Rachel Green,What do you really want to do?
Rachel Green,Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Rachel Green,"Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
Rachel Green,That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Rachel Green,I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
Rachel Green,I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Rachel Green,Excuse me?
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?"
Rachel Green,A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
Rachel Green,"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office."
Rachel Green,Excuse me?
Rachel Green,"Can you please, please take care of it for me?"
Rachel Green,Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Rachel Green,That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?"
Rachel Green,Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner."
Rachel Green,"That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power."
Rachel Green,Today.
Rachel Green,"No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening."
Rachel Green,"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me."
Rachel Green,"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out."
Rachel Green,"I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?"
Rachel Green,"Come on, I don't know what else to do."
Rachel Green,Ross?
Rachel Green,You're pretty.
Rachel Green,"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, they were popular when I left!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!"
Rachel Green,Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Rachel Green,"Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!"
Rachel Green,"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!"
Rachel Green,"Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon."
Rachel Green,"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
Rachel Green,"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!"
Rachel Green,"No, I can't, I have a baby."
Rachel Green,Why would you do that?
Rachel Green,That's really nice.
Rachel Green,"Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you."
Rachel Green,"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
Rachel Green,"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside."
Rachel Green,"OK, thank you."
Rachel Green,"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!"
Rachel Green,What? You really think she's hot?
Rachel Green,And Joey?
Rachel Green,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Rachel Green,Thank you!
Rachel Green,So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
Rachel Green,Hello.
Rachel Green,"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology."
Rachel Green,"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ..."
Rachel Green,"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you."
Rachel Green,"Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished."
Rachel Green,I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass"". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate."
Rachel Green,"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship."
Rachel Green,"It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?"
Rachel Green,"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her."
Rachel Green,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away."
Rachel Green,"Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son."
Rachel Green,"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you."
Rachel Green,If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Rachel Green,"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle."
Rachel Green,"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother."
Rachel Green,Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Rachel Green,I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Rachel Green,"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!"
Rachel Green,Shh!
Rachel Green,"I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see."
Rachel Green,"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over."
Rachel Green,"Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, give me!"
Rachel Green,"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?"
Rachel Green,Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Rachel Green,"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?"
Rachel Green,"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over."
Rachel Green,Mmm hmm.
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?"
Rachel Green,"Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . ""From Gavin"""
Rachel Green,"Awww, awww, it's beautiful."
Rachel Green,"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?"
Rachel Green,Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Rachel Green,You do?
Rachel Green,"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ..."
Rachel Green,Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
Rachel Green,No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and..."
Rachel Green,"You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf..."
Rachel Green,"You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!"
Rachel Green,"I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes."
Rachel Green,Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Rachel Green,Who is it?
Rachel Green,Why?
Rachel Green,"Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin."
Rachel Green,"I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick."
Rachel Green,Oh no no no.
Rachel Green,So did I.
Rachel Green,It's just a cold.
Rachel Green,What? What's the matter?
Rachel Green,Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
Rachel Green,"Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!"
Rachel Green,I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Rachel Green,Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Rachel Green,"Right, right, yes!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
Rachel Green,OK.
Rachel Green,I thought it was Ross.
Rachel Green,There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Rachel Green,"All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place."
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.
Rachel Green,So seriously...rodeo clown?
Rachel Green,"Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!"
Rachel Green,"Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o' clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk... somebody here?"
Rachel Green,Who?
Rachel Green,You've being seeing someone?
Rachel Green,"Hi, and I am also Emma's mother."
Rachel Green,Wow. She does that a lot!
Rachel Green,"What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?"
Rachel Green,How do you know about that?
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?"
Rachel Green,Score.
Rachel Green,"Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah.
Rachel Green,What? Who?
Rachel Green,"Whoa, how do you know about that?"
Rachel Green,Why didn't I get that message?
Rachel Green,"From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?"
Rachel Green,Ross?
Rachel Green,Why?
Rachel Green,Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, ""what, you live together but you're not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird? And I say ""No.You know what, it's not, because it works for us! But you know this doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!"
Rachel Green,"And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore."
Rachel Green,Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma."
Rachel Green,"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so..."
Rachel Green,Bye!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?"
Rachel Green,I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Rachel Green,"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date."
Rachel Green,Why? What's the big deal?
Rachel Green,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set."
Rachel Green,So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
Rachel Green,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!"
Rachel Green,"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken."
Rachel Green,"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive."
Rachel Green,Really? What's that like?
Rachel Green,"Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
Rachel Green,This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Rachel Green,I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Rachel Green,He's not stoned.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, four times."
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry."
Rachel Green,Don't touch my coat!
Rachel Green,"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!"
Rachel Green,"Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?"
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?"
Rachel Green,"Well, uh..."
Rachel Green,"Really, really not."
Rachel Green,"All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve."
Rachel Green,I just had a rough night.
Rachel Green,Eww!
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?"
Rachel Green,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up."
Rachel Green,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this."
Rachel Green,"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show."
Rachel Green,Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
Rachel Green,You got it!
Rachel Green,Your agent called. You got that audition.
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it."
Rachel Green,You saw that?
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials."
Rachel Green,"Oh, anything yet?"
Rachel Green,"Joey, that was formula."
Rachel Green,"Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph."
Rachel Green,Hi you guys!
Rachel Green,"Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment."
Rachel Green,No. I was just going to do this myself.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?"
Rachel Green,Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Rachel Green,Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Rachel Green,There is a hardware store right down the street?
Rachel Green,This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks."
Rachel Green,Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.
Rachel Green,Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Rachel Green,Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Rachel Green,"I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?"
Rachel Green,No you really think that's what it is?
Rachel Green,"Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!"
Rachel Green,Argh. fascist.
Rachel Green,"Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!"
Rachel Green,"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?"
Rachel Green,Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys."
Rachel Green,I'm so sorry Pheebs.
Rachel Green,Hey! How was basketball?
Rachel Green,"Oh, no! Who did that?"
Rachel Green,"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?"
Rachel Green,"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!"
Rachel Green,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!"
Rachel Green,": Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!"
Rachel Green,What are you doing?
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom."
Rachel Green,"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
Rachel Green,"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's."
Rachel Green,"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail..."
Rachel Green,Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back."
Rachel Green,"Joey, come on!"
Rachel Green,"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?"
Rachel Green,Original.
Rachel Green,Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Rachel Green,That's not Monica!
Rachel Green,Oh God.
Rachel Green,"Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!"
Rachel Green,Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever ."
Rachel Green,"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!"
Rachel Green,Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Rachel Green,Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Rachel Green,"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker."
Rachel Green,Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
Rachel Green,Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
Rachel Green,She dropped off a casserole?
Rachel Green,What's going on?
Rachel Green,"Well, there's two spots left right?"
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands."
Rachel Green,"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"""
Rachel Green,I don't really care about the Knicks.
Rachel Green,You would do that? I never get picked!
Rachel Green,I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I have another idea!"
Rachel Green,"Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?"
Rachel Green,"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?"
Rachel Green,"All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!"
Rachel Green,"OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !"
Rachel Green,"Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets."
Rachel Green,"Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work."
Rachel Green,"No, she was just much better at job than me!"
Rachel Green,You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Rachel Green,"Hi mum, put her back on!"
Rachel Green,"Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter? TV: ""And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"""
Rachel Green,"Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!"
Rachel Green,"She said ""gleba""!!"
Rachel Green,Isn't that amazing?
Rachel Green,Why-why aren't you more excited?
Rachel Green,"Oh, but of course it is!"
Rachel Green,I don't know all the words.
Rachel Green,"Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!"
Rachel Green,"Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up ."
Rachel Green,"Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi."
Rachel Green,You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?"
Rachel Green,Me too.
Rachel Green,"I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less."
Rachel Green,Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
Rachel Green,Are you serious?
Rachel Green,"Hey, that was an honest mistake!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, that was an awesome day! Opening credits."
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!"
Rachel Green,SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Rachel Green,"NO! Or, cut!You know, that's your call!"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!"
Rachel Green,"God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!"
Rachel Green,"Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress."
Rachel Green,"Oh screw her, that part is mine!"
Rachel Green,"Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here."
Rachel Green,But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
Rachel Green,It's over! You have to accept that.
Rachel Green,Kiss me.
Rachel Green,Kiss me.
Rachel Green,"No, I'm saying..."
Rachel Green,just... don't talk...
Rachel Green,"Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!"
Rachel Green,Can I ask you a question?
Rachel Green,Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Rachel Green,"Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey."
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense."
Rachel Green,"I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday."
Rachel Green,Olivia.
Rachel Green,So do you think that my dream means anything?
Rachel Green,Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Rachel Green,You took the same class twice.
Rachel Green,"Ok, we're still on that."
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
Rachel Green,How...how...?
Rachel Green,uh-huh.
Rachel Green,Wow...definitely just Drake...
Rachel Green,What...how is it going with Drake?
Rachel Green,What...that scene I saw was so good!
Rachel Green,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
Rachel Green,So?
Rachel Green,"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?"
Rachel Green,Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Rachel Green,"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene."
Rachel Green,"Joey, you never..you never talked about that before..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry."
Rachel Green,"Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?"
Rachel Green,Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Rachel Green,No reason.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe."
Rachel Green,Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Rachel Green,"Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet."
Rachel Green,I know them from work.
Rachel Green,"No, one of them..."
Rachel Green,"I don't know, what were the names I just said?"
Rachel Green,"All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?"
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight."
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah..."
Rachel Green,You are having a party tonight??
Rachel Green,And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Rachel Green,You do that every year??
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??"
Rachel Green,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Rachel Green,"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?"
Rachel Green,"Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
Rachel Green,"Well, then so you just invite me...!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please..."
Rachel Green,"OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! And it's out of my system!"
Rachel Green,"Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play."
Rachel Green,"I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!"
Rachel Green,"... Ok, who is this?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!"
Rachel Green,Sure! Oh...
Rachel Green,"What? Yes, I am!"
Rachel Green,"When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!"
Rachel Green,Ok! Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Rachel Green,And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Rachel Green,Ok professor or detective?
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!"
Rachel Green,"Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number."
Rachel Green,Nice to meet you.
Rachel Green,Ok Monica: We will!!
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
Rachel Green,How is it going with Charlie?
Rachel Green,I always loved that!!
Rachel Green,Come on! I think this is funny!
Rachel Green,I think I am.
Rachel Green,"Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?"
Rachel Green,"Joey, you're so sweet."
Rachel Green,Who ? Joey: Me.
Rachel Green,What? Really?
Rachel Green,"Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Very funny... Joey. Chandler: So, how did you enjoy the play?"
Rachel Green,"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey."
Rachel Green,"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
Rachel Green,Well hello !
Rachel Green,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
Rachel Green,I'm gonna do it.
Rachel Green,"No. Ross: Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? Ross: I'm smarter than him!"
Rachel Green,"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!"
Rachel Green,Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Rachel Green,"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO."
Rachel Green,"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting..."
Rachel Green,"Well, I would like to have the option!!"
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!"
Rachel Green,I don't care about any of that!!
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!"
Rachel Green,I promise.
Rachel Green,But I am going hunting!!
Rachel Green,Hi there!
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate."
Rachel Green,And... taped back together.
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,through the glass doors.
Rachel Green,Alright-y then.
Rachel Green,"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person."
Rachel Green,Oh... what an interesting name.
Rachel Green,You know I...
Rachel Green,Wow... I really love your...
Rachel Green,"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?"
Rachel Green,Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Rachel Green,"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse."
Rachel Green,Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Rachel Green,I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Rachel Green,Phoebe!!
Rachel Green,"For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!"
Rachel Green,How could you not tell me you worked here?
Rachel Green,"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!"
Rachel Green,Good for you Pheebs!
Rachel Green,"Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!"
Rachel Green,"Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
Rachel Green,"Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!"
Rachel Green,Yeah...
Rachel Green,"Oh, well..."
Rachel Green,"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!"
Rachel Green,"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!"
Rachel Green,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Rachel Green,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something."
Rachel Green,That's not what we're gonna do!
Rachel Green,"Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"
Rachel Green,Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?"
Rachel Green,I'm there!
Rachel Green,"Bye, see ya."
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, that's for men!"
Rachel Green,"On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them."
Rachel Green,"Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!"
Rachel Green,Sure!
Rachel Green,You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Rachel Green,"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!"
Rachel Green,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!"
Rachel Green,"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."
Rachel Green,"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him."
Rachel Green,"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, I get it!"
Rachel Green,"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal."
Rachel Green,So can we keep this between us?
Rachel Green,"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, great!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!"
Rachel Green,"Well, get back in there and talk!"
Rachel Green,What!?
Rachel Green,"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!"
Rachel Green,Oh! What are we gonna do?
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Alright! Enough out of you!
Rachel Green,Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Rachel Green,Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Rachel Green,"Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!"
Rachel Green,"Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!"
Rachel Green,Yeah...
Rachel Green,I try...
Rachel Green,"No, that's David."
Rachel Green,Tip of the iceberg.
Rachel Green,Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Rachel Green,Hey! Hey what's going on?
Rachel Green,"Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"
Rachel Green,"Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy."
Rachel Green,"Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler."
Rachel Green,"What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season."
Rachel Green,It's not the time Charlie.
Rachel Green,"You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work."
Rachel Green,"Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer."
Rachel Green,Ugh.
Rachel Green,"Well, I've brought some books. We could read."
Rachel Green,We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Rachel Green,Kate Miller?
Rachel Green,And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Rachel Green,Thank you.
Rachel Green,"I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home."
Rachel Green,"Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts..."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,"No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain."
Rachel Green,No.
Rachel Green,Joey!
Rachel Green,"Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen."
Rachel Green,"Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?"
Rachel Green,Do ya?
Rachel Green,Later! La...
Rachel Green,"Ok. See you, bye."
Rachel Green,"Ok, good night!"
Rachel Green,Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Rachel Green,Nooo!
Rachel Green,"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!"
Rachel Green,Homo.
Rachel Green,"All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?"
Rachel Green,It was really... great!
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Oh! Weather bitch!
Rachel Green,"It's open! Hi, Joe!"
Rachel Green,"What, is everything ok?"
Rachel Green,"Nooooo, why?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's crazy!"
Rachel Green,"... yeah, it's true."
Rachel Green,"What, hey!"
Rachel Green,"W-What are you, what are you talking about?"
Rachel Green,Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm not talking about her..."
Rachel Green,You know? Forget it!
Rachel Green,"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!"
Rachel Green,"Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!"
Rachel Green,Only like a month!
Rachel Green,"What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!"
Rachel Green,Shoot!
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?..."
Rachel Green,Who...?
Rachel Green,"Oh yes, of course, I remember him!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!"
Rachel Green,But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Rachel Green,"But why, why not?"
Rachel Green,But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!"
Rachel Green,It's not a big deal!
Rachel Green,It's so not a big deal!
Rachel Green,Ok!
Rachel Green,"Ok, I..."
Rachel Green,AAAHHHH!
Rachel Green,"What? Homo ergaster: Some scientists classify some African erectus specimens as belonging to a separate species, Homo ergaster, which differs from the Asian H. erectus fossils in some details of the skull ."
Rachel Green,Ooh... I love Barbados!
Rachel Green,"I know, I'm her!"
Rachel Green,ooh...
Rachel Green,"Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?"
Rachel Green,"What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!"
Rachel Green,"Oh... okay, just hide!"
Rachel Green,"Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!"
Rachel Green,There's no room under the bed.
Rachel Green,Yeah...
Rachel Green,Hi...
Rachel Green,...I really don't...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure..."
Rachel Green,Uh-huh... right... yeah...
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you."
Rachel Green,"That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say."
Rachel Green,You would think!
Rachel Green,Joey!
Rachel Green,How are you doing this?
Rachel Green,How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Rachel Green,"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!"
Rachel Green,"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it..."
Rachel Green,Sure...
Rachel Green,Get out!
Rachel Green,Are they right?
Rachel Green,"Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight."
Rachel Green,Although...
Rachel Green,"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years..."
Rachel Green,"Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now."
Rachel Green,No...
Rachel Green,Yeah...
Rachel Green,Forgotten.
Rachel Green,Nothing...
Rachel Green,"Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here..."
Rachel Green,"Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head..."
Rachel Green,"Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again..."
Rachel Green,Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Rachel Green,"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner."
Rachel Green,Still nervous?
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!"
Rachel Green,So hi!
Rachel Green,"So you eh, you talked to Joey?"
Rachel Green,Oh! That's great!
Rachel Green,"Oh, so everything's okay?"
Rachel Green,"Ah... Well, obviously I think so too."
Rachel Green,Really? Excited?
Rachel Green,"Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?"
Rachel Green,"Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him."
Rachel Green,"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams."
Rachel Green,"Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about."
Rachel Green,"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal."
Rachel Green,What? What is it?
Rachel Green,"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy."
Rachel Green,Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Rachel Green,"Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and..."
Rachel Green,"Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do."
Rachel Green,"Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't..."
Rachel Green,"No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?"
Rachel Green,Goo--ood night!
Rachel Green,"Seriously, good night!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,We weren't doing anything!
Rachel Green,Shhh.
Rachel Green,"No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill."
Rachel Green,"We feel so terrible about this, Ross."
Rachel Green,Ross? Can we just close the door?
Rachel Green,"Ross, say something. Anything."
Rachel Green,"No, no, no!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts."
Rachel Green,"No, but you know what I mean."
Rachel Green,Calm ourselves?
Rachel Green,"Well, what would we be doing?"
Rachel Green,Feel me up?
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you bet."
Rachel Green,"Okay, well, we brought you some wine."
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some."
Rachel Green,No awareness.
Rachel Green,"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this."
Rachel Green,"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!"
Rachel Green,Ooy.
Rachel Green,"Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?"
Rachel Green,"Ross, you don't seem okay."
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me."
Rachel Green,"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too."
Rachel Green,"No, no, it's just that it's getting late..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this."
Rachel Green,Thanks for dinner.
Rachel Green,So.
Rachel Green,"I say 'cheesy line', but ok."
Rachel Green,"I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, so sorry."
Rachel Green,"I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great."
Rachel Green,"Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to."
Rachel Green,"Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!"
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Ow!
Rachel Green,Well this is romantic!
Rachel Green,It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Rachel Green,"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?"
Rachel Green,oooh! Oh oh!
Rachel Green,oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Rachel Green,"Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!"
Rachel Green,"Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!"
Rachel Green,"I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me."
Rachel Green,"Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!"
Rachel Green,"No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through ."
Rachel Green,Hey! Got champagne?
Rachel Green,"Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ..."
Rachel Green,"Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?"
Rachel Green,You like that? Let's take this into high gear.
Rachel Green,"Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!"
Rachel Green,What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Rachel Green,What is the matter with us?
Rachel Green,"No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?"
Rachel Green,"Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?"
Rachel Green,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally..."
Rachel Green,"Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us."
Rachel Green,"Right, totally."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex."
Rachel Green,I know.
Rachel Green,Hmmm... Me too...
Rachel Green,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Rachel Green,Aah... I bet you're right.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed."
Rachel Green,"Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!"
Rachel Green,We're having a party.
Rachel Green,"No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!"
Rachel Green,"Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?"
Rachel Green,"And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!"
Rachel Green,"You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all."
Rachel Green,"Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18."
Rachel Green,"Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon."
Rachel Green,I said it's still nap time.
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, she's still napping."
Rachel Green,"Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again."
Rachel Green,"No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up."
Rachel Green,Oh! Emma might like what?
Rachel Green,What did you get her?
Rachel Green,"Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?"
Rachel Green,"All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us."
Rachel Green,"So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, ok, which one?"
Rachel Green,Wow! That was amazing!
Rachel Green,"Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well."
Rachel Green,Is that it?
Rachel Green,"Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's."
Rachel Green,"Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!"
Rachel Green,Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Rachel Green,"Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!"
Rachel Green,"Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!"
Rachel Green,"No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!"
Rachel Green,"Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!"
Rachel Green,"No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye..."
Rachel Green,OOH! God! Sorry!
Rachel Green,Emma's awake.
Rachel Green,I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Rachel Green,"Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me."
Rachel Green,"I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing ""Happy Birthday"". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
Rachel Green,"Well, I'm very impressed."
Rachel Green,I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!"
Rachel Green,"NO, no science camp!"
Rachel Green,"Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!"
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted."
Rachel Green,Okay.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really..."
Rachel Green,"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie."
Rachel Green,I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Rachel Green,"Of course, I'd be honored!"
Rachel Green,"OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex..."
Rachel Green,Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! Wow! You remember Joey?
Rachel Green,"So now, what are you doing here?"
Rachel Green,"Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!"
Rachel Green,God!
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know, isn't she?"
Rachel Green,"All right. What's your news, Amy?"
Rachel Green,What? Oh my God! To who?
Rachel Green,A-And??
Rachel Green,"No, what's he like?"
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Huh... wow, so he's gotta be..."
Rachel Green,"Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like..."
Rachel Green,"Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry?"
Rachel Green,"Sometimes just nodding is ok. Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!"
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,"Ok, let's keep talking."
Rachel Green,"Amy, hi!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, good for you!"
Rachel Green,"Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!"
Rachel Green,But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Rachel Green,"Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'"
Rachel Green,"Joey, I can't do that!"
Rachel Green,"Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here."
Rachel Green,"No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me."
Rachel Green,"Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok."
Rachel Green,"Amy, that's what I was supposed to wear today, that's why I hung it on the door."
Rachel Green,"Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future."
Rachel Green,"Well, what happened?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, that is so tacky."
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, that's huge!"
Rachel Green,I think it could be kind of great!
Rachel Green,Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker?
Rachel Green,"Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!"
Rachel Green,"Hello? Oh, it's our nanny! Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?"
Rachel Green,Menstrual cramps.
Rachel Green,Can any of you watch Emma?
Rachel Green,"Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?"
Rachel Green,"Well, actually..."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Why not?
Rachel Green,"Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!"
Rachel Green,Wha... the next one?
Rachel Green,"Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?"
Rachel Green,Absolutely.
Rachel Green,"Hey! Hi, how's my girl?"
Rachel Green,Yeah!
Rachel Green,You pierced her ears!?
Rachel Green,You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out."
Rachel Green,Ugh.
Rachel Green,"Nah, I don't really want her to see."
Rachel Green,Nothing.
Rachel Green,"Oh, they're real!"
Rachel Green,"I know, I know, and you were right Ross. You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!"
Rachel Green,I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Rachel Green,Oh yeah? Since when?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Babies don't care if they're slim.
Rachel Green,"Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!"
Rachel Green,You put holes in my baby's ears!
Rachel Green,I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Rachel Green,Excuse me?
Rachel Green,"Joey, where are those bags?"
Rachel Green,Seriously?
Rachel Green,Hips or thighs?
Rachel Green,Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I can give you that."
Rachel Green,"Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are."
Rachel Green,Did you just say Emma?
Rachel Green,So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Rachel Green,That's shocking!
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,My God!
Rachel Green,Congratulations! Wow!!
Rachel Green,Mmh-mmh!
Rachel Green,"Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?"
Rachel Green,"GIVE ME THE BOOK! Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, ""Guy-in-van""?"
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in."
Rachel Green,"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys."
Rachel Green,Who's Gladys?
Rachel Green,"Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!"
Rachel Green,"Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so..."
Rachel Green,"No, I couldn't let you do that."
Rachel Green,But I don't want you to.
Rachel Green,But I insist harder!
Rachel Green,"No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!"
Rachel Green,Did you watch the tape?
Rachel Green,But you are a liar.
Rachel Green,"Well, this is going well."
Rachel Green,"Wow! Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly?"
Rachel Green,"Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!"
Rachel Green,Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Rachel Green,O-oh my God!
Rachel Green,"Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?"
Rachel Green,"Joey, we're not keeping this!"
Rachel Green,"Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted."
Rachel Green,"Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep."
Rachel Green,"She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob."
Rachel Green,"Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game."
Rachel Green,Yes I can!
Rachel Green,She's yours!
Rachel Green,She's yours!
Rachel Green,She's mine!
Rachel Green,She's mine!
Rachel Green,I want Gladys!
Rachel Green,She's mine!
Rachel Green,She's mine!
Rachel Green,Excellent!
Rachel Green,"Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old."
Rachel Green,"Oh, don't be such a baby! end."
Rachel Green,Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Rachel Green,"Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry."
Rachel Green,Absolutely.
Rachel Green,"So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?"
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, what!?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground."
Rachel Green,"All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little."
Rachel Green,"Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes."
Rachel Green,"Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!"
Rachel Green,All right!
Rachel Green,"Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!"
Rachel Green,"Ok, careful."
Rachel Green,"Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!"
Rachel Green,"I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out."
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,"Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!"
Rachel Green,"Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?"
Rachel Green,"Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag."
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?"
Rachel Green,"Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life."
Rachel Green,"Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?"
Rachel Green,I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
Rachel Green,Alright fine. I'll do it.
Rachel Green,If you hold a spider.
Rachel Green,IF you hold a spider.
Rachel Green,"Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one."
Rachel Green,Ok...
Rachel Green,Ok... O-k...
Rachel Green,Ok...
Rachel Green,whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Rachel Green,A-alright! I can do this.
Rachel Green,That's because he's on your neck.
Rachel Green,ROSS! end.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Rachel Green,It's not? When was she born?
Rachel Green,Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Rachel Green,Did you at least win the contest?
Rachel Green,Can't wait!
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?"
Rachel Green,Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Rachel Green,"Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy..."
Rachel Green,And a thousand dollars.
Rachel Green,"...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important..."
Rachel Green,Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Rachel Green,"Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid."
Rachel Green,"Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!"
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, you have to calm down."
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,You heard them say that?
Rachel Green,"All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!"
Rachel Green,"No, what?"
Rachel Green,"No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!"
Rachel Green,Because I already did!
Rachel Green,No...
Rachel Green,What are you doing here!
Rachel Green,And I won!
Rachel Green,Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
Rachel Green,Yeah. That's me!
Rachel Green,She won a thousand dollars!
Rachel Green,"Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap."
Rachel Green,"Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?"
Rachel Green,"You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time."
Rachel Green,"Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad."
Rachel Green,"Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? ."
Rachel Green,"Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time."
Rachel Green,"Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together."
Rachel Green,"You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey."
Rachel Green,"Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning."
Rachel Green,Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door."
Rachel Green,"You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together."
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,So bad.
Rachel Green,Dessert?
Rachel Green,Congratulatioooons!
Rachel Green,"Ewww, is that what that is?"
Rachel Green,Yeah! I'll cook!
Rachel Green,Hey!
Rachel Green,I lent them to Ross.
Rachel Green,I'm so happy for you!
Rachel Green,To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,"Hey, who's Phoebe with?"
Rachel Green,Do you think I'm someone else?
Rachel Green,"Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat."
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,what?
Rachel Green,"Oh! Oh, no!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ..."
Rachel Green,Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Rachel Green,"Ah, this place is great!"
Rachel Green,"Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!"
Rachel Green,"Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!"
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants..."
Rachel Green,"Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you."
Rachel Green,"Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you."
Rachel Green,Why do men keep talking to me like this?
Rachel Green,We got some really great stuff!
Rachel Green,Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Rachel Green,"Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing."
Rachel Green,"My God, get a room!"
Rachel Green,"Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?"
Rachel Green,"No, you gotta pick one!"
Rachel Green,You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, no, no. That is a doll."
Rachel Green,"Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty."
Rachel Green,He's not having an affair!
Rachel Green,"No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, that doesn't mean anything."
Rachel Green,"""Dude, Where's My Car?"""
Rachel Green,They're in a caaar...
Rachel Green,Geez!
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun."
Rachel Green,"I'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, look at her, so happy!"
Rachel Green,Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Rachel Green,Who's Nancy?
Rachel Green,Are you serious?
Rachel Green,"What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!"
Rachel Green,Yeah it is.
Rachel Green,"Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!"
Rachel Green,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
Rachel Green,Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Rachel Green,"You're fly is open, Geller!"
Rachel Green,"Ow, that had to hurt!"
Rachel Green,"No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this."
Rachel Green,Oooohh that's interesting.
Rachel Green,14?
Rachel Green,Space cowboy!
Rachel Green,Ow...Oh Gosh!
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh-oh, he's a transponce-transpondster!"
Rachel Green,"Y'know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!"
Rachel Green,That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Rachel Green,"Well it stupid, unfair question!"
Rachel Green,"Hey, what's-what's going on?!"
Rachel Green,"Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler."
Rachel Green,"Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that."
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold."
Rachel Green,And a crappy New Year.
Rachel Green,You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Rachel Green,"Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... maybe close your blinds at night."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone."
Rachel Green,Aah! Why? What are these for?
Rachel Green,Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Rachel Green,"Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out."
Rachel Green,"Oh, d'you like it?"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that."
Rachel Green,"Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party."
Rachel Green,"Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!"
Rachel Green,"Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!"
Rachel Green,Uh! The police!
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!"
Rachel Green,"No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!"
Rachel Green,This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Rachel Green,"I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!"
Rachel Green,It... You can so totally tell.
Rachel Green,"Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going ."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. ."
Rachel Green,Bitchin'
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,I am sooo drunk.
Rachel Green,I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Rachel Green,Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Rachel Green,"Oh, what a line."
Rachel Green,"Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!"
Rachel Green,Yeah okay.
Rachel Green,"No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?"
Rachel Green,So maybe something in an office.
Rachel Green,Really?
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix."
Rachel Green,Uh... November?
Rachel Green,Hey Pheebs...
Rachel Green,Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Rachel Green,"Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!"
Rachel Green,"Goody, what is it!"
Rachel Green,"What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that."
Rachel Green,Happy wedding day!
Rachel Green,"Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages."
Rachel Green,What d'you want?
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!"
Rachel Green,"Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!"
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross."
Rachel Green,"All right fine, I pick you."
Rachel Green,Oh my...
Rachel Green,"Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other."
Rachel Green,Who's there?
Rachel Green,Uh.
Rachel Green,"You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick."
Rachel Green,"Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog."
Rachel Green,Since when do you watch the news?
Rachel Green,"Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?"
Rachel Green,"Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!"
Rachel Green,"Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey."
Rachel Green,"Geez Ross, you could have showered."
Rachel Green,"How was the honeymoon? Phoebe; Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!"
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,I did not know you spoke French.
Rachel Green,Oh... you're so sexy!
Rachel Green,"Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya."
Rachel Green,Ross...
Rachel Green,My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barney's.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated."
Rachel Green,"No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own."
Rachel Green,Ok. If you really need to.
Rachel Green,"Oh, I really could."
Rachel Green,Ohh...
Rachel Green,"Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green."
Rachel Green,"Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here."
Rachel Green,Can somebody please go in?
Rachel Green,"Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?"
Rachel Green,"Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?"
Rachel Green,Ok.
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Uh. Did you call your parents?
Rachel Green,Oh good.
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Rachel Green,"Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name."
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,"Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!"
Rachel Green,Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?"
Rachel Green,"Ok, maybe you're right."
Rachel Green,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?"
Rachel Green,Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
Rachel Green,Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Rachel Green,I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Rachel Green,"Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?"
Rachel Green,"Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!"
Rachel Green,Wow. Ok.
Rachel Green,Mhm-mh!
Rachel Green,Sure.
Rachel Green,Hmm-hmm.
Rachel Green,Yep.
Rachel Green,FYI..
Rachel Green,"In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it."
Rachel Green,"Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!"
Rachel Green,Oh stop that!
Rachel Green,"Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)"
Rachel Green,"Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me."
Rachel Green,"Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,"Oh, good."
Rachel Green,"Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say ""thank you"" for coming with me."
Rachel Green,"And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again."
Rachel Green,"It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good."
Rachel Green,"Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?"
Rachel Green,You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Rachel Green,"Well, I guess that's all in the past, now."
Rachel Green,Not even one more time?
Rachel Green,No matter how much we want it.
Rachel Green,That's what we decided.
Rachel Green,...It's kinda hard though!
Rachel Green,"You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste."
Rachel Green,...Ross?
Rachel Green,Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Rachel Green,Hi you guys.
Rachel Green,"Ooh, Italian!"
Rachel Green,Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
Rachel Green,Congratulations!
Rachel Green,Ooh!
Rachel Green,"Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing."
Rachel Green,Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Rachel Green,But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
Rachel Green,Sssshhhh!
Rachel Green,Hi... I'm on a date...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there."
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Yes, hi!"
Rachel Green,Hi! Excuse us.
Rachel Green,"Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!"
Rachel Green,Wha... My resume? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resume.
Rachel Green,Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
Rachel Green,What? I-I don't.
Rachel Green,"No, I-I-I love it there."
Rachel Green,Oh! It's not good.
Rachel Green,"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren."
Rachel Green,"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true."
Rachel Green,"Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days."
Rachel Green,"Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!"
Rachel Green,"No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job."
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,"No, it's okay, you didn't know."
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank you..."
Rachel Green,"Well, now I don't have to."
Rachel Green,"Ross, what is taking you so long?"
Rachel Green,Mark? Oh my God!
Rachel Green,I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day."
Rachel Green,"No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work."
Rachel Green,"Well, screw charity work. What've you got?"
Rachel Green,Great! I'll call ya!
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Rachel Green,Yes.
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,What? You don't want me to get a job?
Rachel Green,Ugh.
Rachel Green,"Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security."
Rachel Green,Hi you guys!
Rachel Green,"Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet."
Rachel Green,"Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins."
Rachel Green,He offered me one.
Rachel Green,"I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great..."
Rachel Green,The job is in Paris.
Rachel Green,He offered me one.
Rachel Green,The job is in Paris. FADE OUT.
Rachel Green,"Oh, God! Please, somebody say something."
Rachel Green,"I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable."
Rachel Green,"I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want."
Rachel Green,Thank you! Thank you!
Rachel Green,I think it is.
Rachel Green,I got a really incredible job offer.
Rachel Green,It's in Paris.
Rachel Green,"Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board."
Rachel Green,"Joey, it would mean so..."
Rachel Green,Joey...
Rachel Green,Hi.
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!"
Rachel Green,"Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me."
Rachel Green,"No, I'm still going."
Rachel Green,"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?"
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Rachel Green,Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
Rachel Green,Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
Rachel Green,"Well, I took it."
Rachel Green,"Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice..."
Rachel Green,"Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can..."
Rachel Green,"Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,You really think so?
Rachel Green,But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Rachel Green,All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Rachel Green,"Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!"
Rachel Green,"Oh! Oh, I'm so happy."
Rachel Green,"Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose."
Rachel Green,"Ha, tails!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, that sounds good!"
Rachel Green,It's all done!
Rachel Green,"I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane..."
Rachel Green,"Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them."
Rachel Green,It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Rachel Green,"What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!"
Rachel Green,"Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!"
Rachel Green,Hi you guys!
Rachel Green,"No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine."
Rachel Green,"Well, I've been better."
Rachel Green,"You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?"
Rachel Green,I'm gonna miss you so much.
Rachel Green,"You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here ."
Rachel Green,"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start."
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh. . What is this?"
Rachel Green,"I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!"
Rachel Green,I love you Phoebe.
Rachel Green,"All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going."
Rachel Green,Ok. Monica?
Rachel Green,Can you come here with me for a minute?
Rachel Green,"Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me..."
Rachel Green,I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
Rachel Green,
Rachel Green,I... I... I...
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get."
Rachel Green,"Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with..."
Rachel Green,"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room."
Rachel Green,Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Rachel Green,Oh honey...
Rachel Green,"Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you."
Rachel Green,Okay. Oh...
Rachel Green,Oh!
Rachel Green,Oh... Well...
Rachel Green,I think I'm gonna take off.
Rachel Green,"Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night."
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Ross...
Rachel Green,You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Rachel Green,"I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me."
Rachel Green,"Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!"
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,WHAT?
Rachel Green,"So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me."
Rachel Green,What?!
Rachel Green,Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Rachel Green,It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Rachel Green,Ah.
Rachel Green,I know!
Rachel Green,Morning!
Rachel Green,Hey.
Rachel Green,Good. You?
Rachel Green,Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Rachel Green,You too. Last night was just wonderful.
Rachel Green,I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Rachel Green,"Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye."
Rachel Green,Hi!
Rachel Green,Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Rachel Green,"No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday."
Rachel Green,"Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!"
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,"Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a cafe, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw."
Rachel Green,Oh... Bye guys.
Rachel Green,"Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!"
Rachel Green,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Hi! Oh my gosh!
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,What... What...
Rachel Green,Aw..
Rachel Green,"Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful."
Rachel Green,"Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane."
Rachel Green,"Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much."
Rachel Green,"I will. Ross, come here."
Rachel Green,I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Rachel Green,"Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there."
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!"
Rachel Green,Oh.
Rachel Green,"Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this."
Rachel Green,"I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size."
Rachel Green,"Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem."
Rachel Green,Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Rachel Green,Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Rachel Green,Hello?
Rachel Green,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Phoebe? Is everything okay?
Rachel Green,What? Why?
Rachel Green,"Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane."
Rachel Green,"Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris."
Rachel Green,"Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange."
Rachel Green,"I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right."
Rachel Green,Well...
Rachel Green,"Wait, what are you doing?"
Rachel Green,Could I get some peanuts?
Rachel Green,This is ridiculous! I...
Rachel Green,"Yeah, okay."
Rachel Green,Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
Rachel Green,"What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?"
Rachel Green,Yeah?
Rachel Green,What?
Rachel Green,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,I - I have to get on the plane.
Rachel Green,"Yes, I do."
Rachel Green,"They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,I'm so sorry.
Rachel Green,"Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane."
Rachel Green,Excuse me?
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them."
Rachel Green,"Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!"
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off..."
Rachel Green,I got off the plane.
Rachel Green,I do love you.
Rachel Green,"Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again."
Rachel Green,"Okay. You and me, alright? This is it."
Rachel Green,I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Rachel Green,"Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?"
Rachel Green,"Okay, should we get some coffee?"
