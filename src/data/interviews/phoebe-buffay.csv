speaker,transcript
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, does he eat chalk?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!"
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! Be murky!
Phoebe Buffay,"If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off."
Phoebe Buffay,"Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few..."
Phoebe Buffay,I helped!
Phoebe Buffay,"What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
Phoebe Buffay,"Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time."
Phoebe Buffay,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Phoebe Buffay,What I said you had...
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, was I doing it again?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,...Then I've already seen this one!
Phoebe Buffay,"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, look, don't touch that!"
Phoebe Buffay,Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! I found it!
Phoebe Buffay,She is so great! I miss her.
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
Phoebe Buffay,She's a waitress.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi guys!
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
Phoebe Buffay,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'..."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!"
Phoebe Buffay,"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Lizzie."
Phoebe Buffay,I brought you alphabet soup.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that's fine, no."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I'm fine."
Phoebe Buffay,Huh!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
Phoebe Buffay,Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Phoebe Buffay,"Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb."
Phoebe Buffay,"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not."
Phoebe Buffay,There it is!
Phoebe Buffay,"You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-"
Phoebe Buffay,Did he mention us?
Phoebe Buffay,If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,I got no sleep last night!
Phoebe Buffay,"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!"
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,"I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed."
Phoebe Buffay,"I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, look, I have elbows!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!"
Phoebe Buffay,You are just like Jack.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
Phoebe Buffay,Floopy?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, like that's a word."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,I don't even have a 'pl'.
Phoebe Buffay,And-and a power tie?
Phoebe Buffay,Big Bird's friend.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman."
Phoebe Buffay,Definitely not his mother.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
Phoebe Buffay,You'd already broken up.
Phoebe Buffay,A couple hours.
Phoebe Buffay,There he is! There he is!
Phoebe Buffay,Right- where we've been looking all night!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
Phoebe Buffay,What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you gonna go over there?
Phoebe Buffay,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Phoebe Buffay,"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, have a good break-up."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it was really hard."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, you weren't there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
Phoebe Buffay,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Wait here. Breathe.
Phoebe Buffay,It's like a gift.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'd like that."
Phoebe Buffay,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, how'd it go?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
Phoebe Buffay,That oughta do it.
Phoebe Buffay,"The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
Phoebe Buffay,Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Phoebe Buffay,"Seriously, what-what's the part?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much."
Phoebe Buffay,Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I never call me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh... Milwaukee.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Rachel."
Phoebe Buffay,"New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la..."
Phoebe Buffay,About what?
Phoebe Buffay,What surprise party?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he didn't tell me."
Phoebe Buffay,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Phoebe Buffay,Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay,Wait a minute. What's his name?
Phoebe Buffay,Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Phoebe Buffay,Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Phoebe Buffay,Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Phoebe Buffay,You betcha!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that sucks!"
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks!
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
Phoebe Buffay,What'd I say?
Phoebe Buffay,"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh."
Phoebe Buffay,You missed a belt loop.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, it's in spasm."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! That's so nice...
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,What were you modeling for?
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, all done."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
Phoebe Buffay,Almost never.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh.
Phoebe Buffay,Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Phoebe Buffay,It's nice that he has someone.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?"
Phoebe Buffay,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Phoebe Buffay,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you wish!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, oh, good."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year."
Phoebe Buffay,"I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la..."
Phoebe Buffay,
Phoebe Buffay,"...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy..."
Phoebe Buffay,
Phoebe Buffay,...I feel a little sneezy And now I-
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
Phoebe Buffay,Could you speak up please?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, we're gonna take a short break."
Phoebe Buffay,"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
Phoebe Buffay,Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying."
Phoebe Buffay,I can hop.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, he hasn't been around."
Phoebe Buffay,Minsk?
Phoebe Buffay,I know where Minsk is.
Phoebe Buffay,"So when, when do you leave?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hello?
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?"
Phoebe Buffay,So-so you're really not going?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh don't do that.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no no.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, but I can't do that-"
Phoebe Buffay,"It's your thing, and-"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, um, stay."
Phoebe Buffay,Stay.
Phoebe Buffay,Getting so good at that!
Phoebe Buffay,And then... your face is bloated?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, Max!"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you alright?
Phoebe Buffay,You're going to Minsk.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say 'no! No! I can't understand that!'."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me."
Phoebe Buffay,And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Phoebe Buffay,Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Phoebe Buffay,I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Phoebe Buffay,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Phoebe Buffay,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
Phoebe Buffay,"Where? Ooh, come to Momma."
Phoebe Buffay,We should do something. Whistle.
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, do it."
Phoebe Buffay,Do it!
Phoebe Buffay,Do it do it do it!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you did that!
Phoebe Buffay,"I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe nobody's tried this.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey hey hey! She's on!
Phoebe Buffay,Your mom was arrested?
Phoebe Buffay,What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Phoebe Buffay,I'm in.

Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Rach.
Phoebe Buffay,Hello.
Phoebe Buffay,Going to the hospital tonight?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. 'Kay."
Phoebe Buffay,"You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, whadyou do with him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Look at you! How, how do you feel?"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we both have."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, actually it's just from me."
Phoebe Buffay,You know who shaved you? That was me.
Phoebe Buffay,I sang. Hah!
Phoebe Buffay,You're welcome.
Phoebe Buffay,"What, that's it?"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't think you mean that.
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta."
Phoebe Buffay,Sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
Phoebe Buffay,Fine!
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, you know Paolo?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he made a move on me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
Phoebe Buffay,Uma Thurman.
Phoebe Buffay,She is gonna hate me.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Are you moving out?
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
Phoebe Buffay,Which proves that I never lie.
Phoebe Buffay,Paolo made a pass at me.
Phoebe Buffay,Are you okay?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
Phoebe Buffay,Such a pig!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh he's like a...
Phoebe Buffay,...like a...
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, good! Ok..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
Phoebe Buffay,The end.
Phoebe Buffay,Should I not have told you?
Phoebe Buffay,"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so..."
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok bye-bye."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, just look at her..."
Phoebe Buffay,You ok?
Phoebe Buffay,Yep!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, you're having a boy!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
Phoebe Buffay,Oops!
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
Phoebe Buffay,Isn't he great?
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is my friend Roger."
Phoebe Buffay,It's Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,Isn't he good?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Phoebe Buffay,So what's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing, nothing."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
Phoebe Buffay,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Phoebe Buffay,Intense and creepy.
Phoebe Buffay,"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, right."
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
Phoebe Buffay,I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
Phoebe Buffay,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
Phoebe Buffay,Eww!
Phoebe Buffay,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
Phoebe Buffay,Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Phoebe Buffay,So was it a lot more money?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?"
Phoebe Buffay,OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
Phoebe Buffay,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! Brian's Song!
Phoebe Buffay,Yummy noises.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, is this the bug lady?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Phoebe Buffay,Ten dollars an hour for what?
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! You have a window!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Phoebe Buffay,OK.
Phoebe Buffay,"Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells."
Phoebe Buffay,"In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
Phoebe Buffay,"Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Phoebe Buffay,You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Phoebe Buffay,How's this?
Phoebe Buffay,Sorry. How about over here?
Phoebe Buffay,"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?"
Phoebe Buffay,What about this?

Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson."
Phoebe Buffay,Morly Safer.

Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, really."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rifts. Yeah, I know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?"
Phoebe Buffay,where were you standing?
Phoebe Buffay,"Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new?"""
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I mean, I'm not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah Im fine.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Right, and its me."
Phoebe Buffay,Much as you are.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thats good."
Phoebe Buffay,Good choice.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, my first birthday present... ..oh, this is really..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohhh... Sure, yeah... ..okay, it fits."
Phoebe Buffay,"That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, well, maybe now its not okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Wherere you going?
Phoebe Buffay,With?
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us."
Phoebe Buffay,"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but..."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,But hes falling in love with her.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay... Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, oh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, what's going on?"
Phoebe Buffay,"oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?"
Phoebe Buffay,Trouble?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um you, you got a minute?"
Phoebe Buffay,So.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, oh, I got you a birthday present."
Phoebe Buffay,"Right, like the kind you..."
Phoebe Buffay,How'd you know I was coming?
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you did this.
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you... ..did this.
Phoebe Buffay,"So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?"
Phoebe Buffay,Does he know?
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you."
Phoebe Buffay,You got me.
Phoebe Buffay,"So, um, are you gonna call him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,No. No food with a face.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you too."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, um..."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,": Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!"
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
Phoebe Buffay,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Oooh...
Phoebe Buffay,Is he alright?
Phoebe Buffay,": Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh..."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,: Your Visa bill is huge!
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, right."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Congratulations!
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
Phoebe Buffay,OOooooo!
Phoebe Buffay,"But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
Phoebe Buffay,": Oh I see, so then, you were lying."
Phoebe Buffay,About how good your cards were.
Phoebe Buffay,A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ha. Ha, ha."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank y...
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, we should. I think we should."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! .... or no.
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Um... I'm out.
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, in or out?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK Joey, your bet."
Phoebe Buffay,Ross?
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,Me too. Rachel.
Phoebe Buffay,Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm in.
Phoebe Buffay,...teen!
Phoebe Buffay,That's a bird?
Phoebe Buffay,That's a bird!
Phoebe Buffay,So good!
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast..."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, how?"
Phoebe Buffay,Which one?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky..."
Phoebe Buffay,Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, but there isn't always time!"
Phoebe Buffay,Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,Marcel?
Phoebe Buffay,Marcel?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh-my-God!
Phoebe Buffay,Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea."
Phoebe Buffay,Nope.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Phoebe Buffay,"How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!"
Phoebe Buffay,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, they're just talking..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!"
Phoebe Buffay,That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Not a good day for birds...
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Phoebe Buffay,You cook naked?
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
Phoebe Buffay,How many beeps?
Phoebe Buffay,How'd he take it?
Phoebe Buffay,Sex in his chair.
Phoebe Buffay,Where are you going?
Phoebe Buffay,Radiator.
Phoebe Buffay,Rdtor.
Phoebe Buffay,You know he's gay?
Phoebe Buffay,Whoo-hoo!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay,"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,Lotsa things.
Phoebe Buffay,"I think she means 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm totally getting it!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
Phoebe Buffay,Aww.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl."
Phoebe Buffay,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Phoebe Buffay,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Phoebe Buffay,...Flame Boy.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Tell him, tell him."
Phoebe Buffay,Doing it on this table.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are."
Phoebe Buffay,"What... I could, I could do it. What is it?"
Phoebe Buffay,I could be a secretary.
Phoebe Buffay,I could do that.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe 25-26."
Phoebe Buffay,There you go.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Uh, I'm on."
Phoebe Buffay,"Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
Phoebe Buffay,Ross says hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
Phoebe Buffay,All right. Bye bye.
Phoebe Buffay,Whatcha doin'?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, because, you know... they don't like you."
Phoebe Buffay,I thought you knew that.
Phoebe Buffay,Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing""."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
Phoebe Buffay,You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Phoebe Buffay,"That is so sweet, you guys."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Mon."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, oh, I've gotta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are."
Phoebe Buffay,"I really do, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss."
Phoebe Buffay,You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but you can't."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh uh.
Phoebe Buffay,Petrie.
Phoebe Buffay,"Did I miss it, did I miss it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical."
Phoebe Buffay,
Phoebe Buffay,"They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks, Ross."
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
Phoebe Buffay,"They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la."
Phoebe Buffay,This is so great.
Phoebe Buffay,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, he's beautiful!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Susan, he looks just like you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
Phoebe Buffay,"We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew..."
Phoebe Buffay,So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Phoebe Buffay,"Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, let me see!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the..."
Phoebe Buffay,So you do know who he is! Sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
Phoebe Buffay,Remembered what?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. This is really, really huge."
Phoebe Buffay,Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Phoebe Buffay,"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe there's someone else.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,"'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, so what were you thinking?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh! No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm still on ""no."""
Phoebe Buffay,What's goin' on?
Phoebe Buffay,Ewww!
Phoebe Buffay,Where?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, that's it, I quit."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
Phoebe Buffay,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Phoebe Buffay,Demi Moore.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
Phoebe Buffay,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that."
Phoebe Buffay,You wanna do it right now?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
Phoebe Buffay,"Woof, woof."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
Phoebe Buffay,"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs."
Phoebe Buffay,Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ben, dinner!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok."
Phoebe Buffay,"I licked my arm, what?"
Phoebe Buffay,So?
Phoebe Buffay,You won't even taste it?
Phoebe Buffay,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
Phoebe Buffay,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
Phoebe Buffay,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Phoebe Buffay,"I miss Janice though. ""Hello, Chandler Bing."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true."
Phoebe Buffay,"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
Phoebe Buffay,Nah. Not really.
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I just don't buy it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, don't get me started on gravity."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed."
Phoebe Buffay,Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Phoebe Buffay,Really? You can actually see it?
Phoebe Buffay,"See, I didn't know that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?"
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
Phoebe Buffay,"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope."
Phoebe Buffay,He's even kind of cute.
Phoebe Buffay,I'd call that excessive.
Phoebe Buffay,Janice? You called Janice?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you caved.
Phoebe Buffay,"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh. Why is that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!"
Phoebe Buffay,You're there!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend."
Phoebe Buffay,I might have.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace."
Phoebe Buffay,You have a third nipple?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, is there a hair on it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Ta-da.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Do I? Thank you, so do you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo."
Phoebe Buffay,OK.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, right, OK. Ole."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha."
Phoebe Buffay,"So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday."
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh. . .K. How come?
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Huuh.
Phoebe Buffay,"I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties."
Phoebe Buffay,So how long have you known?
Phoebe Buffay,"And um, and there's actually a, a woman?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,"I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'"
Phoebe Buffay,Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Phoebe Buffay,"So, um, have you told your parents?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better."
Phoebe Buffay,So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?"
Phoebe Buffay,It's Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross."
Phoebe Buffay,Let's see!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, look at these prices."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just..."
Phoebe Buffay,Not for you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine. All right, fine."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, then...Let's."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's like a skit."
Phoebe Buffay,Cool.
Phoebe Buffay,So...Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Actually, it makes us feel that big."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff."
Phoebe Buffay,Fine.
Phoebe Buffay,Ok. One.
Phoebe Buffay,"We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck""."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget."
Phoebe Buffay,"Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed."
Phoebe Buffay,"But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk."
Phoebe Buffay,"And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
Phoebe Buffay,Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la...."
Phoebe Buffay,"... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Right. My name was on there, but now it just says ""carrot cake"". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, so you know D?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, do you know A minor?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords.
Phoebe Buffay,"Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!"
Phoebe Buffay,You're all invited to bite me!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hi."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money."
Phoebe Buffay,Really? From who?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Here you go.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's ""smelly cat, smel-ly cat""."
Phoebe Buffay,Better. Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song."
Phoebe Buffay,You wanna try it again?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mmmm hmmm.
Phoebe Buffay,That's too much. Sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation."
Phoebe Buffay,"Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet...."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, whad'ya mean? He's not British."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, I figured it out."
Phoebe Buffay,Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe Buffay,"Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet."
Phoebe Buffay,"You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Phoebe Buffay,"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did."
Phoebe Buffay,And we did.
Phoebe Buffay,Yay me.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on."
Phoebe Buffay,"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him."
Phoebe Buffay,Um-hum.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, actually."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, all right."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, ""Two of Them Kissed Last Night""."
Phoebe Buffay,"There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!"
Phoebe Buffay,"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y."
Phoebe Buffay,What makes it pilgrim?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!"
Phoebe Buffay,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,What were you thinking?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls."
Phoebe Buffay,I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Phoebe Buffay,"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?"
Phoebe Buffay,"This is my father, this is a picture of my dad."
Phoebe Buffay,"No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Just, you know, to see... um."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, is this really my father?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God.
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math."
Phoebe Buffay,"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know."
Phoebe Buffay,Whattaya mean?
Phoebe Buffay,Wow. Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, let's go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, here, you have to hold this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, this is it, 74."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, here I go. I'm goin' in."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'."
Phoebe Buffay,OK.
Phoebe Buffay,Mailbox.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . ."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I couldn't go in."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
Phoebe Buffay,You guuuyys.
Phoebe Buffay,Are... are you OK?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better."
Phoebe Buffay,Fun Bobby is so great.
Phoebe Buffay,Half full of looooovvvvve.
Phoebe Buffay,Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
Phoebe Buffay,Two.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, cake."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooohh, why?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,But you guys came so close.
Phoebe Buffay,That is funny.
Phoebe Buffay,It's not that bad.
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, OK, don't get all squinky."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel? Um, hi."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, my, oh!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I, OK...."
Phoebe Buffay,Bye.
Phoebe Buffay,You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
Phoebe Buffay,"OK honey, you're dating Ross."
Phoebe Buffay,Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, noone is named Sleeve."
Phoebe Buffay,What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Phoebe Buffay,So... and?
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far."
Phoebe Buffay,I think it went into me.
Phoebe Buffay,Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Phoebe Buffay,"In my day, divorce was not an option."
Phoebe Buffay,That's him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, do you wanna sit?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?"
Phoebe Buffay,Everything?
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa, that's a lot of stuff."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face."
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out."
Phoebe Buffay,Sir! No sir!
Phoebe Buffay,"Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go."
Phoebe Buffay,I miss Rose.
Phoebe Buffay,"I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, that's so nice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, me, too, technically."
Phoebe Buffay,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I know. Hello."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Rob Dohnen.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, wow."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them."
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la..."
Phoebe Buffay,"There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yay, I rock."
Phoebe Buffay,But.
Phoebe Buffay,I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Phoebe Buffay,I can do that.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Thinkin' about it.
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, hi again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!"
Phoebe Buffay,Fired! Why?
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Phoebe Buffay,I see.
Phoebe Buffay,"No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?"
Phoebe Buffay,Who's Barney.
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, Rachel, I'm ready."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, yeah I guess that's me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme."
Phoebe Buffay,Stick a fork what?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you just know."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share..."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
Phoebe Buffay,"There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, I think I want to write a song about all this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?"
Phoebe Buffay,About 20 minutes. CLOSING CREDITS
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, some guy she met at the movies."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hang in there, it's gonna happen."
Phoebe Buffay,Because she's your lobster.
Phoebe Buffay,"C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . ."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, do you have any other possibilities?"
Phoebe Buffay,What is that sparkly thing?
Phoebe Buffay,Do you want a refill?
Phoebe Buffay,"OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now."
Phoebe Buffay,It's not that bad.
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,I think she's OK.
Phoebe Buffay,Do the claws again.
Phoebe Buffay,Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Mon, what is this?"
Phoebe Buffay,"See, he's her lobster."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey cool, mine too."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress."
Phoebe Buffay,"I can be a waitress. OK watch this. Um, gimme two number ones, 86 the bacon, one Adam and Eve on a raft and rick'em, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la."
Phoebe Buffay,It's James Bond.
Phoebe Buffay,"That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there."
Phoebe Buffay,You are so smitten.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out."
Phoebe Buffay,So. You two are totally into each other.
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?"
Phoebe Buffay,We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Phoebe Buffay,You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH."
Phoebe Buffay,You're not the only one who has a date tonight.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, absolutely."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you are so lucky.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ahh.
Phoebe Buffay,Okey-doke.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily."
Phoebe Buffay,I think on my shoulder.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I think you should tell them."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh."
Phoebe Buffay,Here we go.
Phoebe Buffay,You're not going?
Phoebe Buffay,What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, who is the boss of you?!!"
Phoebe Buffay,No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh that looks so good, oh I love it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ahh. OK, let's see yours again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, well then what is this?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, that's my tattoo."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven."
Phoebe Buffay,I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge."
Phoebe Buffay,So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered."
Phoebe Buffay,"Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat."
Phoebe Buffay,"I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm done now.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know."
Phoebe Buffay,"OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video."
Phoebe Buffay,"Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. OK."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God.
Phoebe Buffay,"I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I can't work with people who would do this."
Phoebe Buffay,I mean this poor woman.
Phoebe Buffay,"The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels."
Phoebe Buffay,"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody."
Phoebe Buffay,Monica.
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation."
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you play with your roommate?
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, it'll be fun."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him."
Phoebe Buffay,"And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night."
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best."
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?"
Phoebe Buffay,Why would you kill his fish?
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks."
Phoebe Buffay,"But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?"
Phoebe Buffay,Didn't it like totally speak to you?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, 'cause he's yummy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um-um, um-um."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date."
Phoebe Buffay,Paul.
Phoebe Buffay,Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Phoebe Buffay,I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Is anyone else starting to really like him?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Phoebe Buffay,"Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie."
Phoebe Buffay,"C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun."
Phoebe Buffay,What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Phoebe Buffay,Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Phoebe Buffay,"He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said."
Phoebe Buffay,"What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies."
Phoebe Buffay,"With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
Phoebe Buffay,"Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease."
Phoebe Buffay,"Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity."
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
Phoebe Buffay,Me too.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed."
Phoebe Buffay,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm so glad you're here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name."
Phoebe Buffay,And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Phoebe Buffay,No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, hey, no, oh oh."
Phoebe Buffay,"No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you crazy?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I don't know."
Phoebe Buffay,"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, thanks. Sorry, again"
Phoebe Buffay,What was that?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping."
Phoebe Buffay,"I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok."
Phoebe Buffay,So talk to her.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, oh, is, is Frank home."
Phoebe Buffay,"Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior."
Phoebe Buffay,Ok so will he be back soon?
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Stilts?
Phoebe Buffay,Wow.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know what to do with that.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'"
Phoebe Buffay,That'll work too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, that'd be ok."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, I'm in the book."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright. So um, stilts huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey nice boobs.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are."
Phoebe Buffay,Why not her?
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I didn't know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?"
Phoebe Buffay,"And because you're both, you know, white women."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon."
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen if you wanna go, just go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, I can get you out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Great, I'm seeing water rings again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious."
Phoebe Buffay,There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
Phoebe Buffay,Everything you've heard is true.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, welcome to the fu-oh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah? Are you sure, really."
Phoebe Buffay,"I, I, I'm hideous."
Phoebe Buffay,Come in.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Ryan, what's up?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox."
Phoebe Buffay,Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Phoebe Buffay,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, ohh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now."
Phoebe Buffay,Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Phoebe Buffay,"And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary."
Phoebe Buffay,"I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had."
Phoebe Buffay,That you don't stop talking about it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. This is what I do for luck, ok."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body."
Phoebe Buffay,Give it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good."
Phoebe Buffay,"Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder."
Phoebe Buffay,Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Phoebe Buffay,Bye.
Phoebe Buffay,It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
Phoebe Buffay,Please.
Phoebe Buffay,I got it.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know what, that's it, that's it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, I'll walk you out."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that."
Phoebe Buffay,Bye you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, you look so good!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, stop it, you're freaking me out."
Phoebe Buffay,"I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, like you never talk that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Bye, good luck."
Phoebe Buffay,"So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that ."
Phoebe Buffay,What does she mean by HH?
Phoebe Buffay,Are you the cutest?
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy."
Phoebe Buffay,It could be like a big giant guy.
Phoebe Buffay,We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'"
Phoebe Buffay,Well at least we know she's a woman.
Phoebe Buffay,"Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, my."
Phoebe Buffay,She wants to meet you in person.
Phoebe Buffay,"What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much."
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to..."
Phoebe Buffay,"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal."
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe, because you told him not to."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!"
Phoebe Buffay,No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Phoebe Buffay,"Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is."
Phoebe Buffay,"Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hello.
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you! I know, though."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny."
Phoebe Buffay,All right all ready.
Phoebe Buffay,"We could not, would not want to wait."
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, you might be the first one."
Phoebe Buffay,"""Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?"" Is that too spooky?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Phoebe Buffay,What am I gonna do?
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that."
Phoebe Buffay,Hummus. I got the hummus.
Phoebe Buffay,That won't go with this dress though.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place."
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, you don't know that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm ready."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'"
Phoebe Buffay,Duh!! Christmas!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?"
Phoebe Buffay,Definitely.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, we're on it. We're on it."
Phoebe Buffay,Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!"
Phoebe Buffay,How did you do that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're not a dingus."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah. What's this?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, not even a little bit."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay then."
Phoebe Buffay,Good. So what were you thinking?
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Hellooo!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
Phoebe Buffay,"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?"
Phoebe Buffay,What are you saying I should do?
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you, Monica."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes? Yes! Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, oh! It's on again!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play."
Phoebe Buffay,That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Phoebe Buffay,"What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh ."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel."
Phoebe Buffay,"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
Phoebe Buffay,Two?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
Phoebe Buffay,Helloo! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"No it's not, sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit."
Phoebe Buffay,"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, no, I understand."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but he's always late."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me."
Phoebe Buffay,Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Phoebe Buffay,This is everybody. This is Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay,Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,This is Monica.
Phoebe Buffay,And this is Rachel.
Phoebe Buffay,I'm gonna get coffee.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah! Yeah, no, we're gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ew!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah. You can do it to."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that...."
Phoebe Buffay,Feburary 16th.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, that's close. When's yours?"
Phoebe Buffay,"That's the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay so, by melting, you meant melting."
Phoebe Buffay,So is it like art?
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I'm just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache."
Phoebe Buffay,"G'night, bro."
Phoebe Buffay,"Here. Y'know, just in case."
Phoebe Buffay,No kind. He just makes it up.
Phoebe Buffay,"So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and...."
Phoebe Buffay,Ah!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
Phoebe Buffay,I just asked you.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't have time for this.
Phoebe Buffay,Which you just gave up really quickly.
Phoebe Buffay,"Build the unit Cinderelly, lay the tile Cinderelly."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. 'Hello. Oh my God, I totally forgot! Well can't someone else do it. But, I have company. Yeah, no look, that's all right I'll come in.' Um, Frank, I'm really sorry but I have to go to work. It's-it's one of my regulars and he's insisting that I do 'um."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, y'know we don't call it that, but yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,All righty. I'll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, you can get one yourself. It'll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!-Hey! What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,You can't have sex with her!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes."
Phoebe Buffay,So that's what you thought I did!! God! That's not what I do!
Phoebe Buffay,Nooo! Why would you think that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Whatever, it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways."
Phoebe Buffay,You really thought it was perfect?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't....
Phoebe Buffay,"Right, okay, um-mm."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I guess I do, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I-I wasn't hopping mad, y'know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,She wasn't a hooker.
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, it's like a dirty math problem."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that is so unfortunate."
Phoebe Buffay,Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Phoebe Buffay,You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Phoebe Buffay,Bye-bye! That's why I moved out.
Phoebe Buffay,I think on some levels she already knows.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well maybe not on those levels."
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, nobody good?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, really?"
Phoebe Buffay,So what are they doing?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you're early."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
Phoebe Buffay,You don't play the oboe!
Phoebe Buffay,Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
Phoebe Buffay,"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill."
Phoebe Buffay,"Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening."
Phoebe Buffay,"Aww, good. What?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! Why?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
Phoebe Buffay,"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Aw, God Ross. Oh."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know no, no, y'know you don't deserve this, you don't Ross. You're, you're really, you're so good."
Phoebe Buffay,And you're so sweet. And you're kind
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, it's okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, that's not something a girl wants to hear."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,You have chalk on your face.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Ross you're right, I don't know why I always thought this was real grass."
Phoebe Buffay,Who's singing?
Phoebe Buffay,Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
Phoebe Buffay,"Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooooh, nice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yay!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,Is that a problem?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Oh! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it."
Phoebe Buffay,"'Kay, put your head back."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I have ya. Oh God."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?"
Phoebe Buffay,I am soo dead.
Phoebe Buffay,Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, you must've won like a contest or something!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it..."
Phoebe Buffay,"When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's Monica's bed. What?
Phoebe Buffay,"So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, it's just my tooth."
Phoebe Buffay,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him."
Phoebe Buffay,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead."
Phoebe Buffay,Ow! Ow!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set."
Phoebe Buffay,"Although, don't feel like you can't visit."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......"
Phoebe Buffay,No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know."
Phoebe Buffay,"'Hey! You're not dead! Okay, see ya!'"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
Phoebe Buffay,"Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Phoebe Buffay,He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Love....
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,I've found....
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. ."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever."
Phoebe Buffay,Yay!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so how do we decide that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh cool, this is my first huddle."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so what do you guys really think of Chandler?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.

Phoebe Buffay,Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!

Phoebe Buffay,"Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Woo-yay!!
Phoebe Buffay,I love this game!!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on Mon, let her throw the ball."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait-wait-wait-wait! So, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going."
Phoebe Buffay,Isn't there a national football league.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?"
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh..."
Phoebe Buffay,Destiny.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Phoebe Buffay,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what happens to the old guys?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that."
Phoebe Buffay,This is the worst Christmas ever.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, God bless us, everyone."
Phoebe Buffay,"Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... ."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he's very charming."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you're just gonna have to try."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you."
Phoebe Buffay,Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, what happened?"
Phoebe Buffay,How can you not know which one?
Phoebe Buffay,We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh well y'know.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ick, you were eavesdropping."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"God, I hope they kick his ass!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it."
Phoebe Buffay,"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, can you dance at all?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What, what is that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!"
Phoebe Buffay,"What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What are you wrapping?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's a vase."
Phoebe Buffay,Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Phoebe Buffay,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that's he's going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm going to let him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert."
Phoebe Buffay,"You've have lipstick right here . That's okay, it's mine, we just kissed."
Phoebe Buffay,I'll have coffee.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I get more because I'm dainty."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What? What? You guys, what is going on? You not like Robert? Why are you laughing?!"
Phoebe Buffay,You guys!! Come on!
Phoebe Buffay,What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. Ooh! Don't sit down!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. And, first here's a gift."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's all right, that's well, I figured...."
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I can spot you from here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, listen Robert..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I think you're really, really great..."
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before."
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?"
Phoebe Buffay,Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, bummer."
Phoebe Buffay,No. But thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. No. But thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?"
Phoebe Buffay,Where's Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That's the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together."
Phoebe Buffay,You never run on a barge!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Phoebe Buffay,"It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know."
Phoebe Buffay,You think you know me so well.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,That's what I said.
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives."
Phoebe Buffay,I stepped in something icky.
Phoebe Buffay,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Phoebe Buffay,"I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and, I don't know where his country is."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh!! That's my new thing. I figure bodies at peace, make peace."
Phoebe Buffay,Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There's a 'g' in there.
Phoebe Buffay,In your atlas!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, well he's very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn't speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me."
Phoebe Buffay,What is this?
Phoebe Buffay,"Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,See there it is right there.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way."
Phoebe Buffay,"Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
Phoebe Buffay,You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Phoebe Buffay,Interesting.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other."
Phoebe Buffay,That would be great. Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, tell him, apology accepted."
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Plate! Yes, plate."
Phoebe Buffay,"See, we don't need them."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Ameri-can.
Phoebe Buffay,Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine."
Phoebe Buffay,"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail."
Phoebe Buffay,Now what is Fabutec?
Phoebe Buffay,Waxine!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl."
Phoebe Buffay,God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Phoebe Buffay,They have the best stuff in there.
Phoebe Buffay,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,"
Phoebe Buffay,Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Phoebe Buffay,Was it not pain-free?
Phoebe Buffay,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad."
Phoebe Buffay,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!!
Phoebe Buffay,Ow!!!
Phoebe Buffay,We're all right.
Phoebe Buffay,We're all right.
Phoebe Buffay,"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, come here."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"What, what are they talking about?"
Phoebe Buffay,Whe-where did he put it?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday."
Phoebe Buffay,Should we do something?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there."
Phoebe Buffay,We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not the used wax."
Phoebe Buffay,"They're gonna get through this, aren't they?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved."
Phoebe Buffay,They've been quiet for a long time.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh come on, they can be in the same room."
Phoebe Buffay,Why? What happened now?
Phoebe Buffay,Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy...."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, look, I found coffee! Okay, let's skedaddle."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, your highness."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, Rachel I'm really sorry. That's okay, do you wanna get back together? Yeah, okay. Did anyone else hear that?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohhh boy, do I feel bad."
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler what are you doing?!
Phoebe Buffay,Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Phoebe Buffay,"Him? Him, Ross?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler!!
Phoebe Buffay,What does the sign say?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab."
Phoebe Buffay,Please!
Phoebe Buffay,Aren't you gonna go?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, Monica's are the biggest."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Oh, no!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, this has happened before."
Phoebe Buffay,Yep. Put more gas in.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, what town are we near?"
Phoebe Buffay,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that."
Phoebe Buffay,But if...
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, thank God."
Phoebe Buffay,I ate a bug.
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, please."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we're then gonna go skiing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, otherwise, I mean that's, that's, that's just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? Can you be civil?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported."
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, or the rodeo!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Bye!!!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!!
Phoebe Buffay,Frank! Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,What are you doing here?
Phoebe Buffay,What happened?
Phoebe Buffay,"But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?"
Phoebe Buffay,Your getting married?!
Phoebe Buffay,My little brother's getting married!!
Phoebe Buffay,Do I?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I do, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, isn't it fantastic?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What, he's 18."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm a big surprise."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!"
Phoebe Buffay,"But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes. Not out loud.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank."
Phoebe Buffay,You're Frank's best man?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well then, what about you?! Huh?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined."
Phoebe Buffay,"Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What umm, what happened?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, sweetie, oh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, but."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but not just that."
Phoebe Buffay,None the less.
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. ."
Phoebe Buffay,We were out of Doritos.
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Phoebe Buffay,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
Phoebe Buffay,Huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, you're like a zillionaire?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, kinda."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman..."
Phoebe Buffay,It isn't?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ahh, his work is done."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, just a barrel."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
Phoebe Buffay,"So, I'm here, ready to play."
Phoebe Buffay,"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's a dog, every house should have a dog."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, that's the ghost for the attic."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination."
Phoebe Buffay,The little ones do.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, look!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this."
Phoebe Buffay,"The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Watch, watch."
Phoebe Buffay,"And, and!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Phoebe Buffay,All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh. What is this?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, they took my idea!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Okay, here you go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, are you guys okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, oh, about three months."
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?"
Phoebe Buffay,"'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift."
Phoebe Buffay,"Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I have to tell you something."
Phoebe Buffay,But I can't tell you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but let's come back to that later!"
Phoebe Buffay,Noo!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?"
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't!!
Phoebe Buffay,"I, but you're so close! No!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, that's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing."
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Rachel, that's what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don't get through, they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It's us versus them!"
Phoebe Buffay,Like a date type person?
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Ooh, I'm setting the phone down. But I'm still here! Just don't go anywhere I'm still here. Don't-don't switch or anything, 'cause I'm, I'm right here. Just one sec. One sec! One second!! Wait! One second! Just..."
Phoebe Buffay,"What?! Monica, I'm scared!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!! Yes!! I'm the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, is the play over?"
Phoebe Buffay,Nah. I kept myself busy.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, yeah. I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you're play. I swear you're play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You're play is the next play is the next play I'm gonna see."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I..."
Phoebe Buffay,"I do, I believe you."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back."
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people."
Phoebe Buffay,Vince is a fireman.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't."
Phoebe Buffay,"That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!!!
Phoebe Buffay,No! No!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,"...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Jason is not a sissy!
Phoebe Buffay,"God, that is the nicest kitchen."
Phoebe Buffay,"No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day."
Phoebe Buffay,All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, I didn't..."
Phoebe Buffay,Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math."
Phoebe Buffay,Jason?
Phoebe Buffay,Nah-ha!
Phoebe Buffay,"""Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..."" Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, this is none of my business."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, that could've been really awkward."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, so, so you went to Pete's..."
Phoebe Buffay,"So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name."
Phoebe Buffay,Well then definately don't take his name.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeesh, what'd you do about it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it..."
Phoebe Buffay,"You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Great! Okay, good for you!"
Phoebe Buffay,Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Phoebe Buffay,Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, she was bald, she's not now."
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, Bonnie's the best!"
Phoebe Buffay,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, that's too bad!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?"
Phoebe Buffay,No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Phoebe Buffay,"Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive."
Phoebe Buffay,You said it was okay!
Phoebe Buffay,What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?"
Phoebe Buffay,Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
Phoebe Buffay,So?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, we killed them all."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look."
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know what that means?
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?"
Phoebe Buffay,So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma."
Phoebe Buffay,"And this time, they've ganged up to form one giant, super hat."
Phoebe Buffay,Oy!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage."
Phoebe Buffay,"Knock, knock, knock."
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, what? What was it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, no, it was great."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, so, how are we doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm kind, caring, and sweet. What's Monica like?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, I think she knows where my Dad is."
Phoebe Buffay,"She was acting, she was pretending like she hasn't heard from him on years, but I found this picture on her fridge, and look ! Isn't this what he would look like now?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, but we're having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, she's gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I don't know! So, you're all bored?"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I'm gonna close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Ooh, y'know we could just do this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn't happened yet, but we're all very excited."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, take 'em off!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Phoebe Buffay,"After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm."
Phoebe Buffay,She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, don't ""Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"" me yet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, are any of those people here?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!"
Phoebe Buffay,No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!"
Phoebe Buffay,My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Heh?
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!"
Phoebe Buffay,How close?
Phoebe Buffay,I don't even know how that would work!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm not asking!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't ever want to see you again!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, where's my purse?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, my new Mom, who-who's a big, fat abandoner!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone."
Phoebe Buffay,Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here! Oh. Are you? Are you?!! Ohh! That's so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. But for you, yay! Ohh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, Ursula."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well umm, I know that we haven't talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom."
Phoebe Buffay,You know her?!
Phoebe Buffay,"There-there was a suicide note?! Well, do you still have it?"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note!
Phoebe Buffay,"I, umm, shut up!"
Phoebe Buffay,"""Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk."" You just wrote this!"
Phoebe Buffay,Noooo!!
Phoebe Buffay,No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
Phoebe Buffay,Ewwww!!
Phoebe Buffay,Ewwww!!
Phoebe Buffay,"""...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm."" Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. Except for you. You go away."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, bye."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?"
Phoebe Buffay,It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Phoebe Buffay,I-I like pizza!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, so do I!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out."
Phoebe Buffay,"...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I actually don't know..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God."
Phoebe Buffay,Nothing. Nothing.
Phoebe Buffay,"I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself."
Phoebe Buffay,"No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred."
Phoebe Buffay,"I just feel so, uhh....."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah? Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, how many parents have you lost?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,I think she would like that.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you. We both forgive you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, Mom, I'll take you home."
Phoebe Buffay,How come?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I didn't hear that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!"
Phoebe Buffay,That's weird.
Phoebe Buffay,Your nails.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, don't panic. I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails, no one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great. Oh! Oh, it's 'cause they're gonna eat-that's the problem."
Phoebe Buffay,And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Phoebe Buffay,I don't get it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Op, the ruined quiches are ready."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica."
Phoebe Buffay,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one's outta here."" Though some things don't change."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Phoebe Buffay,They're not even touching the lasagna!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, they love your casserole."
Phoebe Buffay,It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! New wallet, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it's against my oath as a masseuse."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't what your talking about.
Phoebe Buffay,Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Phoebe Buffay,These old things.
Phoebe Buffay,"You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him."
Phoebe Buffay,On the touchy.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know! I-I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, baseball. Rick, playing baseball. Okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little... Oh no-wait no, no! No! Okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. Umm, okay, on a plate, maybe Rick's pants come down a little. No! No! Okay, Chandler! Okay Chandler, ooh, that's working."
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler's knees. Chandler's... ankles. Chandler's ankle hair. Oh no. Okay, you're all set."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! In... really long hour world.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you're a client, I can't ask you out, even though you give me y'know, the feeling."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, quit down."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like, 'cause Rick is my ahh, husband."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, I will tell her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y'know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It's been a really bad day, whore wise."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, they thought I was a whore."
Phoebe Buffay,Great! Thank you very much.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey."
Phoebe Buffay,"My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's fun, God I love how sexy I am."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that ""Woo-hoo"" thing."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, cute one!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!"
Phoebe Buffay,You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket."
Phoebe Buffay,"Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water."
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,"But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice."
Phoebe Buffay,It's okay. How's the soup?
Phoebe Buffay,"Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Gunther, kiss me."
Phoebe Buffay,And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey what are you guys looking at?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, come to papa."
Phoebe Buffay,Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,'Kay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"""
Phoebe Buffay,It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?"
Phoebe Buffay,"There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, but I'm doing this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?"
Phoebe Buffay,Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Phoebe Buffay,Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'll have one, please. Plus my money."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look what we almost left."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!"
Phoebe Buffay,"But Mon, you have to get our money!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill."
Phoebe Buffay,She seems fine now.
Phoebe Buffay,"You didn't get the money, did you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, Widow!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go."
Phoebe Buffay,Good.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh... yay!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Phoebe Buffay,"""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..."" Darn it! Now, I don't know who to get to the next verse."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about 'bah-bah-bha-bhan?'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I wanna hear ""The Sound."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, play that funky music white boy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, it was so-wow!"
Phoebe Buffay,"What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear."
Phoebe Buffay,It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, I'm not playing tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!"
Phoebe Buffay,You guys. You suck too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music."
Phoebe Buffay,Does Joey know?
Phoebe Buffay,"I think maybe, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it."
Phoebe Buffay,"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who."
Phoebe Buffay,I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh.
Phoebe Buffay,"You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want."
Phoebe Buffay,"God, what happened?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Open it up, let me see."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, God it looks bad."
Phoebe Buffay,"Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! She's very excited about that.
Phoebe Buffay,"This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, get out of my kitchen!"
Phoebe Buffay,All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, ""That's not how your dad used to do it."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'll get it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, he-he can't talk right now."
Phoebe Buffay,He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Phoebe Buffay,They were threefold.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, there they are!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, get a room."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okayyyyy, open up!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's for our catering business!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette."
Phoebe Buffay,"And also, we don't know what to do with this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh sure, Cilantro Larry."
Phoebe Buffay,"How could you say yes, what about our catering business?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, in that case--Yay! That was me hopping on board."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay! ""Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."" Wow! You really laid into this place."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, all right."
Phoebe Buffay,Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Monica!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception."
Phoebe Buffay,But we've only had one job.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! What are you saying?
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Phoebe Buffay,For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm hearing."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,I wa-I wa-I wa...
Phoebe Buffay,Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team."
Phoebe Buffay,Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Phoebe Buffay,Where were you?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, which museum?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, answer his."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, that paper's two weeks old."
Phoebe Buffay,What's wrong Mon?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yay!"
Phoebe Buffay,I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Phoebe Buffay,"All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?"
Phoebe Buffay,You work with robots!!
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, the robots just work for them."
Phoebe Buffay,"If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry..."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!"
Phoebe Buffay,"So, did you pick one yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
Phoebe Buffay,There's sooo much you don't know.
Phoebe Buffay,"""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap./Asked him to bring my friends all kind of crap./Said all you need is to write them a song./They haven't heard it, so don't try and sing along./No, don't sing along./Monica, Moncia, have a happy Chanukah./Saw Santa Clause, he said hello to Ross./And plese tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy!/And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!""/Happy holidays, everybody!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!"
Phoebe Buffay,"And! And, they're gonna have a baby! And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah
Phoebe Buffay,"Ewww! And ""Oh no!"" It's-they just want me to be the surrogate. It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give."
Phoebe Buffay,I know!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, what's your point?"
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
Phoebe Buffay,My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm late."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, erotiery!"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I get a puppy!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again. Come on, let's go to the balcony."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street. Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back."
Phoebe Buffay,"My mom's gonna be here any minute. I can't do this, I can't give him up. Yes-no, I can. I don't want to. But I can. No."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I can't do this. My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up, then there's no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give 'em-a kidney!"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Ooh! Umm!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, why don't you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I'm really okay with this. Y'know why? 'Cause look at them, and I made that, so... I know it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it's gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. I wanna carry your baby."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I'm gonna carry their baby."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn't be living in an apartment.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, they're just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay everyone, think thick."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi! Wish me luck!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Phoebe Buffay,"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right."
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I'm-I'm Phoebe Buffay, hi! I'm-I'm-I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we're doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you've been there! Umm, y'know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home, so... Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I'm screaming, don't worry, that's what's supposed to happen."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh. Good luck.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they're implanted."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, freaked. 'Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice's like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine."
Phoebe Buffay,"Nope, not knocked up yet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, I'm just gonna y'know, lie it your chair, Y'know? Yeah, good, I'm let gravity y'know, do its jobs."
Phoebe Buffay,"""Are you in there little fetus? In nine will you come great us? I will buy you some Adidas."""
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y'know just remember that it's still really early, okay so, if it says that I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean that I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don't go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this."
Phoebe Buffay,Great.
Phoebe Buffay,You guys! You guys! You're gonna have a baby! They're gonna have a baby!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, but this can't be good for the baby."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
Phoebe Buffay,Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Phoebe Buffay,That sounds great!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Phoebe Buffay,That's a good idea for a business!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel has a new doll.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, what do I smell?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh!
Phoebe Buffay,What? What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I hate to eat and run, but..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I don't need it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?"
Phoebe Buffay,"If you wanted to punish them, you should've just made them hang out here!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, are we gonna trash that place?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wait a minute.
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you ask him out?
Phoebe Buffay,He just got a divorce right?
Phoebe Buffay,"So he's probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move."
Phoebe Buffay,You've never asked a guy out?!!
Phoebe Buffay,Thousands of times!! That doesn't make me sound too good does it?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, please!"
Phoebe Buffay,I've never done that.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Great!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh did you-what did you-did you work for two days straight?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good!
Phoebe Buffay,How? How is your fault?
Phoebe Buffay,"So now, what is this now?"
Phoebe Buffay,And this?
Phoebe Buffay,You make it so funny.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening."
Phoebe Buffay,Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Phoebe Buffay,Don't you just love the way they talk?!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh!
Phoebe Buffay,It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted."
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Aww, Pheebs."
Phoebe Buffay,That's short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Phoebe Buffay,Shhh!! Please! What's he saying?
Phoebe Buffay,What? Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, look, why don't you just, why don't you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us."
Phoebe Buffay,Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause I'm pregnant."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
Phoebe Buffay,Come on! Look where you are!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Remember, a virgin for me please."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you think it will help."
Phoebe Buffay,You should! How is she?
Phoebe Buffay,"Who, Josh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, y'know what, you were right, you were right. We really weren't great at being guys, but you know why? Because we're girls."
Phoebe Buffay,And do you know what girls are really good at?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, listening! Sit! Y'know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! What is that? What is that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I wanna be with her, I like her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohhh, wow."
Phoebe Buffay,What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Phoebe Buffay,Yep!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining."
Phoebe Buffay,Janice.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, why are you doing this anyway?"
Phoebe Buffay,You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Phoebe Buffay,"No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, poor baby."
Phoebe Buffay,She's right! You have to stop!
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!"
Phoebe Buffay,See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No."
Phoebe Buffay,God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Phoebe Buffay,"It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?"
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous."
Phoebe Buffay,Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Phoebe Buffay,"That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh, yeah. You're a genius."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, totally!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me."
Phoebe Buffay,Pastrami.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hm-mm, corn beef."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Six months.
Phoebe Buffay,Not if I get there first.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table."
Phoebe Buffay,You mean like a doctor?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Phoebe Buffay,What do you know?!
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh, that's nice?"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, back to happy. Back to happy!"
Phoebe Buffay,No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Phoebe Buffay,You can't give up on your dream.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking..."
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan."
Phoebe Buffay,My Saturn dealership.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's..."
Phoebe Buffay,The name was my favourite part!
Phoebe Buffay,YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that is better."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! What are you doing here?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with ""The."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk."
Phoebe Buffay,"God, Susan is so fun!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I definitely. I don't like the name Ross."
Phoebe Buffay,No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's just y'know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y'know..."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it's like y'know, Chanoey?"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Gene."
Phoebe Buffay,"Bye, Gene."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, Carol really messed you up!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. All right, so I don't know what sycophant means, but the rest is right."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. The '92 Ross wouldn't.
Phoebe Buffay,Drum roll.
Phoebe Buffay,You're actually going through with this?
Phoebe Buffay,"You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, uh..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, bye!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hello!
Phoebe Buffay,Excuse me.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Nuh-uh! They're maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. See, these names are good, and these names are bad. Ohh."
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know! How are the-the-the-the, y'know-You're clothes aren't funny."
Phoebe Buffay,Boy! I didn't see that coming!
Phoebe Buffay,That's too hard. Too hard!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Or you could end up with everything.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!"
Phoebe Buffay,This is great!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?"
Phoebe Buffay,Good! Good! Five points!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, Joey, same question."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I have cards!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Here! Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay."
Phoebe Buffay,What make you think I can?!
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
Phoebe Buffay,"I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, scarf's done."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, the Olympics."
Phoebe Buffay,I still cannot believe you're engaged! Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Phoebe Buffay,Already?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but y'know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced."
Phoebe Buffay,You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, let me in!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you have to let me in right now!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,I got it! Mine!
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay! Okay, ready?"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I think we are."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, ""It's Not Too Late."""
Phoebe Buffay,Me too.
Phoebe Buffay,Me too.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Phoebe Buffay,I guess.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're such a cheater!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, how'd that happen?"
Phoebe Buffay,What is that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, how did it go?"
Phoebe Buffay,What did he say?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, maybe."
Phoebe Buffay,Any luck?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!"
Phoebe Buffay,Not after this!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What-what's up?
Phoebe Buffay,"Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!"
Phoebe Buffay,So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
Phoebe Buffay,Remembered what?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
Phoebe Buffay,"See, he's her lobster."
Phoebe Buffay,That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!"
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you so much.
Phoebe Buffay,I haven't really had any yet.
Phoebe Buffay,Stop it!
Phoebe Buffay,One of the babies is kicking.
Phoebe Buffay,"It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe I'm gonna have a party! This is so great! A party! Yay!! I don't know why.
Phoebe Buffay,"What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can't use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what's my next present?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, guys."
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alrighty, here come the water works."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's so good. Oh, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, do you see any babies?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I guess. I mean... I don't know, it's just, I guess I know it's going to be over soon."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. It's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing. I'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay that's even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like I know them y'know, I mean-I mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Phoebe Buffay,They are gonna love me.
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks you guys! Again.
Phoebe Buffay,You're the best. Thanks. Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Just kidding. Ahh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Got cha again, you guys are so easy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up."
Phoebe Buffay,"Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, have a great wedding!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no. Oh, nothing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I have a wedgie."
Phoebe Buffay,"So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I do. What's the matter?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married..."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither."
Phoebe Buffay,We thought you knew!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."" Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're gay."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think I can help you get over him."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,And a small piece of chocolate.
Phoebe Buffay,And a glass of tepid water.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay?
Phoebe Buffay,"So uh, now look at the picture..."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, and umm..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, how do you feel now?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy."
Phoebe Buffay,I'll get it.
Phoebe Buffay,Hello.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?"
Phoebe Buffay,So you're not homesick yet?
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, the seven of us miss you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies..."
Phoebe Buffay,Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Phoebe Buffay,"But what about all the ""finding-his-flaws"" stuff we've been doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!"
Phoebe Buffay,"That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."""
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over."
Phoebe Buffay,"I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Phoebe Buffay,What are you saying?!
Phoebe Buffay,No! Ooh! Oh my god!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and..."
Phoebe Buffay,Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends."
Phoebe Buffay,"I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies."
Phoebe Buffay,"No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, were the hell have you been?!"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't want to hear about her!!
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London."
Phoebe Buffay,"No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him."
Phoebe Buffay,I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, so, okay..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,So tell me about this girl?
Phoebe Buffay,Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise."
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?"
Phoebe Buffay,So nothing got ruined?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hello? What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, so what happened?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,You ate meat! You had sex!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica."
Phoebe Buffay,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, me too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh right, maybe I'll just go home."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hello?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, so what happened?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,You ate meat! You had sex!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica."
Phoebe Buffay,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, me too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh right, maybe I'll just go home."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver..."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat-I don't want to talk about it."
Phoebe Buffay,So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Phoebe Buffay,London is stupid! Stupid!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it felt French."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Central... Park!
Phoebe Buffay,"That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ""Well, it's right by my house, all right!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, woo! Hi."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!"
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, she's so stupid!"
Phoebe Buffay,"That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm having my first contraction!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, it's not bad."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!"
Phoebe Buffay,No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!"
Phoebe Buffay,What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor."
Phoebe Buffay,"Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!"
Phoebe Buffay,They are. Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Happy birthday!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, it is."
Phoebe Buffay,Can I tell you a little secret?
Phoebe Buffay,I want to keep one.
Phoebe Buffay,"Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, just ask him!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!"
Phoebe Buffay,You're right.
Phoebe Buffay,Tell him it's for you.
Phoebe Buffay,So did you ask him?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm kinda on a clock here."
Phoebe Buffay,Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, doctor says any minute now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oo, this is a big one. Eww! Arghhhh!!"
Phoebe Buffay,What is that?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Phoebe Buffay,Which one do you have?
Phoebe Buffay,"But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry."
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Phoebe Buffay,They're gonna call her Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay,Works on you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, PBS!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, what's right with them?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back."
Phoebe Buffay,All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Phoebe Buffay,"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish."
Phoebe Buffay,What-what are you talking about?!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. So?
Phoebe Buffay,Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you calling me selfish?!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?"
Phoebe Buffay,Right.
Phoebe Buffay,"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!"
Phoebe Buffay,I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh-ohh!
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not."
Phoebe Buffay,"Aw, dammit!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, it's not a toy."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah that's better than my way.
Phoebe Buffay,Can you hear anything?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, Madlibs, mine!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Phoebe Buffay,Ehh!!
Phoebe Buffay,Come where?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, but try and get Joey too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention."
Phoebe Buffay,We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Phoebe Buffay,"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe!"""
Phoebe Buffay,Count for what?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud."
Phoebe Buffay,Eeeee--ohh!! God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Phoebe Buffay,That might work!
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?"
Phoebe Buffay,"He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies."
Phoebe Buffay,"This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do."
Phoebe Buffay,Nooo!!
Phoebe Buffay,I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I know."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you still mad at us?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good! Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song."
Phoebe Buffay,You're kinda stepping on the song.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! Exactly! And that's why...
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Emily!
Phoebe Buffay,Here.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?"
Phoebe Buffay,It's okay to laugh right?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Yum-my!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,He's so funny!
Phoebe Buffay,Show me the badge again.
Phoebe Buffay,Shiny.
Phoebe Buffay,You are just nonstop!
Phoebe Buffay,Why?!
Phoebe Buffay,You have the power to do that?
Phoebe Buffay,Shut it down.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, ""See you ladle."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, absolutely!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I love that place! So, no."
Phoebe Buffay,Enh. Sure!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose."
Phoebe Buffay,Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Phoebe Buffay,Monica your remote doesn't work.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Aw, forget it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!"
Phoebe Buffay,"More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying- Oh no."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
Phoebe Buffay,Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hello?
Phoebe Buffay,Joey? What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I can't believe you called her fat."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever."
Phoebe Buffay,Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
Phoebe Buffay,What am I sitting on?
Phoebe Buffay,Ew-eww!! Undies!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Okay-ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff."
Phoebe Buffay,"Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he stabbed me first!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,I thought you said you read it in high school.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism."
Phoebe Buffay,You completely stole my answer!
Phoebe Buffay,Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Phoebe Buffay,"I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers."
Phoebe Buffay,Would you care to venture one?
Phoebe Buffay,Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay then.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,You didn't read this one either?!
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,No! You should've read it yourself!
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!"
Phoebe Buffay,What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Phoebe Buffay,"I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys, guess what?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing ""Merry Christmas"" in 25 languages. I lied."
Phoebe Buffay,"Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas. Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's going okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thanks!"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Phoebe Buffay,Just get your nails done?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, you can't take the money out."
Phoebe Buffay,"But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you, Happy Holidays."
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Does it look like an ashtray?
Phoebe Buffay,Does it look like a urinal?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!"
Phoebe Buffay,Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,That chick can't handle my corner.
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?"
Phoebe Buffay,You too!
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! How come?
Phoebe Buffay,Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I taught me and I love me."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hornswoggle? Ooh, this must be killing you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, Lesson One: Chords. Now, I Don'T Know The Actual Names Of The Chords But Umm, I-I-I Made Up Names For The Way My Hand Looks While I'M Doing Them. So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Phoebe Buffay,Then don't touch one!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?"
Phoebe Buffay,Then do Iceberg!
Phoebe Buffay,G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but you're questioning my method!"
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, fine! Take his side!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh!
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended."
Phoebe Buffay,Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So...
Phoebe Buffay,That's weird. I bet they're doing it.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?"
Phoebe Buffay,Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, then what happened?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'll get your turn!
Phoebe Buffay,Nothing! This is not over!
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What were you doing?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, nobody's judging you."
Phoebe Buffay,You two will have very hairy children.
Phoebe Buffay,So are you actually gonna see her again?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay,Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Are you serious?!
Phoebe Buffay,"You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, tough call."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!"
Phoebe Buffay,"It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again."
Phoebe Buffay,"It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter."" And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter."
Phoebe Buffay,It's Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, well, umm Grandma died."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow."
Phoebe Buffay,No you didn't!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!"
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, welcome."
Phoebe Buffay,Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Phoebe Buffay,So how did you know Francis?
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! What's your name?
Phoebe Buffay,You're Frank Buffay?
Phoebe Buffay,You just said...
Phoebe Buffay,But...
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,That was my dad!
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda."" Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it."
Phoebe Buffay,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!"
Phoebe Buffay,He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, thank you for meeting with me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. See?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Phoebe Buffay,Lilly's dead.
Phoebe Buffay,She's dead.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake."
Phoebe Buffay,17 years ago.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go."
Phoebe Buffay,That's a defense?
Phoebe Buffay,You make up songs?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I am."
Phoebe Buffay,"Not yet, no."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Phoebe Buffay,CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Phoebe Buffay,YOU KNOW?!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Get in here!!!
Phoebe Buffay,You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or-Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own."
Phoebe Buffay,Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Phoebe Buffay,No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate."
Phoebe Buffay,And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah the material feels so soft-hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you really wanna know, I'm-Oh! I can't tell you this."
Phoebe Buffay,Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Phoebe Buffay,"I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don't even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee-Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will."
Phoebe Buffay,I have quarters!
Phoebe Buffay,But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Phoebe Buffay,Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?"
Phoebe Buffay,He broke that.
Phoebe Buffay,"I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh? Hello you.
Phoebe Buffay,Eh?
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,"I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in."
Phoebe Buffay,Please.
Phoebe Buffay,"So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?"
Phoebe Buffay,Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!"
Phoebe Buffay,"And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Good idea!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh now, don't give away the farm!"
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay,"I was going too. Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?"
Phoebe Buffay,"So, here we are. Nervous?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I want this to happen."
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!"
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me."
Phoebe Buffay,He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra."
Phoebe Buffay,You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh.
Phoebe Buffay,Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Phoebe Buffay,And why not?!
Phoebe Buffay,You're-you're what?!
Phoebe Buffay,"I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!"
Phoebe Buffay,God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor."
Phoebe Buffay,"Bread, so you never go hungry."
Phoebe Buffay,"And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Mr. President.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hi Ross!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be."
Phoebe Buffay,No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay, my bad."
Phoebe Buffay,That's what I'm saying.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh.
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy."
Phoebe Buffay,But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean."
Phoebe Buffay,"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero."
Phoebe Buffay,"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week."
Phoebe Buffay,All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?"
Phoebe Buffay,You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Phoebe Buffay,No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Phoebe Buffay,Hold it! N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah that's right you are so busted. Book 'em.
Phoebe Buffay,"Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree."
Phoebe Buffay,You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup. Backup! Backup!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!"
Phoebe Buffay,"...so this guy was all And I'm all, Buffay, Homicide. It was just so cool!"
Phoebe Buffay,I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Phoebe Buffay,"You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me, is this your car?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, no. Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4."
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I'm with the umm, the 57th."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, big guy, kinda bald."
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died."
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I sure will, take care."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me. Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler. Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Phoebe Buffay,I would love it if I weren't here!
Phoebe Buffay,Me?!
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer..."
Phoebe Buffay,Gary.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, impressive."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, we'll talk at dinner."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I can't wait!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!"
Phoebe Buffay,You wanna work on your interview skills?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi."
Phoebe Buffay,"Very good handshake, good wrist action."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, then maybe I can come too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, you go."
Phoebe Buffay,"'Kay, bye!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh I just miss him so much!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other."
Phoebe Buffay,So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, seriously! When did it end?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious."
Phoebe Buffay,"God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh we can't, we already have plans."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie."
Phoebe Buffay,You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,You tired Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here."
Phoebe Buffay,We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Phoebe Buffay,What are you talking about?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, great so do you want to do it together?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look at that."
Phoebe Buffay,What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Phoebe Buffay,"So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host."
Phoebe Buffay,Like what?
Phoebe Buffay,Cups? You're giving me cups?
Phoebe Buffay,"Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!"
Phoebe Buffay,I got it! Mine!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, cups."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!"
Phoebe Buffay,And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look! Look! Look!"
Phoebe Buffay,I was in charge of cups.
Phoebe Buffay,I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Phoebe Buffay,Don't get me started on that.
Phoebe Buffay,Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!"
Phoebe Buffay,See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Phoebe Buffay,This is so cool!
Phoebe Buffay,But I like it here!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay! Rach, hi, I need those earrings you borrowed."
Phoebe Buffay,I guess so.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
Phoebe Buffay,These are her earrings.
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,I found it!
Phoebe Buffay,On your dresser.
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe your scene's coming up?
Phoebe Buffay,"This is terrible, what are you going to do?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's not good.
Phoebe Buffay,But I already gave them back to you!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said. Where is that other earring?"
Phoebe Buffay,Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Why are you being weird?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, that would be, ""Why are you being cute?"""
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh! I did not get that.
Phoebe Buffay,Did you find it?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me."
Phoebe Buffay,What are we going to do?!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all."
Phoebe Buffay,I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Phoebe Buffay,"Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! You're the best!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, right!"
Phoebe Buffay,I-I-I found it interesting.
Phoebe Buffay,Ross?
Phoebe Buffay,What else do they add smell too?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no!
Phoebe Buffay,I am definitely gonna watch that!
Phoebe Buffay,Definitely!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, then no."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh!
Phoebe Buffay,John Glenn is here?!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"My God, Joey!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm fine, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,Nope.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what movie should we see?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?! Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe this!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but it is fast. Isn't it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!
Phoebe Buffay,"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks! Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay,"No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Phoebe Buffay,I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Phoebe Buffay,I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Phoebe Buffay,Which is why my answer is yes!
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.
Phoebe Buffay,We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I'm so excited!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, nothing."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, yeah! Today's."
Phoebe Buffay,Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Phoebe Buffay,Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,That's so sweet.
Phoebe Buffay,Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait, one sec. One sec. Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I like waking up with you too. Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. Oh, I can stay here all day."
Phoebe Buffay,We could have breakfast in bed...
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Oh! Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good, you're all up."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, that's over."
Phoebe Buffay,He shot a bird!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright."
Phoebe Buffay,"Nah, I don't feel like playing."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, give him a kiss for me!"
Phoebe Buffay,Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, ""Ross"" on it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh-oh, chilling!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait, my grandmother's dead."
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I've been around."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}"
Phoebe Buffay,But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can."
Phoebe Buffay,"Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?"
Phoebe Buffay,Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Phoebe Buffay,Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Phoebe Buffay,No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Phoebe Buffay,North route or south route?
Phoebe Buffay,Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this guy again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, no thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Phoebe Buffay,Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you don't know I can't help you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I can't help you."
Phoebe Buffay,Apology accepted.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Bye, fat ass."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know! I don't remember!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,No that made me feel precious.
Phoebe Buffay,That game should not be played without my supervision.
Phoebe Buffay,What's in the bag?
Phoebe Buffay,I do!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, dude!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!"
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay,Fauna.
Phoebe Buffay,Garfunkle.
Phoebe Buffay,You said I was boring--Ohh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream."
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Hello? Hey Joey!
Phoebe Buffay,Sure! Where is it?
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?"
Phoebe Buffay,Who was that?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! Monica?
Phoebe Buffay,It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Phoebe Buffay,Which Richard?
Phoebe Buffay,Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?"
Phoebe Buffay,That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Phoebe Buffay,"But again, Simmons. Go on."
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Phoebe Buffay,On a totally different bet.
Phoebe Buffay,Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm gonna go too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked."
Phoebe Buffay,Naked alone time.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Phoebe Buffay,"So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, what about after I give you these candies?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay,Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, London 1..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys wait! Guys! This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!"
Phoebe Buffay,"For 99 cents, I'd eat you. Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! Oh! Look! Hi!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Phoebe Buffay,So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,Monica had lunch with Richard.
Phoebe Buffay,Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Phoebe Buffay,I love Vegas!
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler. I am so sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure! Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, you are so lucky! Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?"
Phoebe Buffay,But she just came up here!
Phoebe Buffay,I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Phoebe Buffay,Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her."
Phoebe Buffay,Good. I should really start wearing hats!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,You guys are here! Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila? and you're Bob Saget.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa, what kind of party was this?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ugh!
Phoebe Buffay,That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Phoebe Buffay,M-M-Mole people?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. What's a lurker?
Phoebe Buffay,Kills you?
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh!
Phoebe Buffay,How do you know about this?
Phoebe Buffay,Dance karate?
Phoebe Buffay,Get out of here you lurker! Go on! Get!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh! You made up!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, get a room."
Phoebe Buffay,I know. Use it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, lost again. That's it! You and me, outside!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Be cool! Okay lady, your lurking days are over!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?"
Phoebe Buffay,What time? Maybe we can share a cab!
Phoebe Buffay,I won! I won! I finally won!
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!
Phoebe Buffay,Sells drugs to kids.
Phoebe Buffay,She sells drugs to kids.
Phoebe Buffay,How about we talk about this over dinner?
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello. My name is Regina Phalange. I'm a businesswoman in town on business. Would you like to see my card? Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you threw out Phoebe. I'm Ms. Regina Phalange. Phalange!"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay! Okay! Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!"
Phoebe Buffay,"What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!-Eh! Well...
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?"
Phoebe Buffay,What about my cab?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back."
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, it's such a long trip."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute."
Phoebe Buffay,Well you don't.
Phoebe Buffay,Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh-oh, that's your thing."
Phoebe Buffay,You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Phoebe Buffay,Sing!!
Phoebe Buffay,"How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Do you like car games?
Phoebe Buffay,I love the license plate game!
Phoebe Buffay,No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court."
Phoebe Buffay,Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
Phoebe Buffay,You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Phoebe Buffay,Is it a meatball sub?
Phoebe Buffay,"No thanks, I've already seen one."
Phoebe Buffay,Always.
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Always.
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ross?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive."
Phoebe Buffay,"So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Rach!
Phoebe Buffay,"Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?"
Phoebe Buffay,Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, why?"
Phoebe Buffay,You're pregnant!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh! That's Good! Wow! But Now If You Were Pregnant, What Would You Name It? Hint Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,"Guys, I'm happy too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?"
Phoebe Buffay,Whatever! What about you Meg?
Phoebe Buffay,"She said, ""He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, bye!"
Phoebe Buffay,So? Did you get the annulment?
Phoebe Buffay,I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love."
Phoebe Buffay,I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh we do, but not just yet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids."
Phoebe Buffay,But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, what?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?"
Phoebe Buffay,My roommate.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, Denise. Denise!"
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?"
Phoebe Buffay,You didn't tell her did you?
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course not, because you're in love with her."
Phoebe Buffay,"What do you mean, comforted her?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!"
Phoebe Buffay,Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil."
Phoebe Buffay,It worked!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, no, look at this! ""Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..."" Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor."
Phoebe Buffay,I saw it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie."
Phoebe Buffay,"I found you in my bed! How'd you whined up there? You are a mystery! Little black curly hair! Little black curly hair! Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hair............"
Phoebe Buffay,"Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, I know what you're thinking."
Phoebe Buffay,"That she's gonna move in with you and maybe then she'll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you're already married, she'll just be happy. Y'know? You're just, you're very sad."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!!
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, Professor and Mrs."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Yeah, y'know you and Ross are still married."
Phoebe Buffay,Just kidding!
Phoebe Buffay,Saved your ass.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you know that psychic I see?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, she told me that I'm gonna die this week, so I'm kinda bummed about that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and I know you guys don't know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't-she said y'know that I'd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, 'cause she didn't tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I've only got a week left, y'know? I've really gotta start living now! , leans back, and starts reading.)"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is it. This what's gonna kill me."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, it's so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could-"
Phoebe Buffay,I was preparing you for my-didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y'know if you can."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Maybe you'll die!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, it'll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I'm not going die!"
Phoebe Buffay,Because my psychic is dead! She must've read the cards wrong!
Phoebe Buffay,"Eh, better her than me! Hey, let's bake cookies!"
Phoebe Buffay,Have you really done this before?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!"
Phoebe Buffay,Another lie. You have a sickness!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well I'll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they're not actually puppies, they're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see ya!"
Phoebe Buffay,Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I'm nervous 'cause I've never done that before by myself!
Phoebe Buffay,"What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don't have a roommate."
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe you could be my roommate!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, she said she'd be back December 26th."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Phoebe Buffay,"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies."
Phoebe Buffay,"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Phoebe Buffay,"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I can still do that."
Phoebe Buffay,How did that happen?!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun."
Phoebe Buffay,"What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!"
Phoebe Buffay,But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!
Phoebe Buffay,"But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Phoebe Buffay,"A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!"
Phoebe Buffay,How do you feel?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, the babies are asleep."
Phoebe Buffay,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Phoebe Buffay,So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how much do you think he needs?"
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Phoebe Buffay,"And also, my birthday."
Phoebe Buffay,What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Phoebe Buffay,"My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, what you're wearing is fine for that."
Phoebe Buffay,I have plans.
Phoebe Buffay,That's right.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!"
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, there's gotta be something."
Phoebe Buffay,Good! Great! You can go first.
Phoebe Buffay,"Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?"
Phoebe Buffay,Great! It worked! No one's sad.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! I call her!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I took it hard too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, how are you guys doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, deep-deep-deep down!"
Phoebe Buffay,Then keep running.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Phoebe Buffay,What else?
Phoebe Buffay,That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
Phoebe Buffay,Ready?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,it's...
Phoebe Buffay,and...
Phoebe Buffay,please...
Phoebe Buffay,leave...
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get ""it's,"" ""and"" oh I'm sorry, I have ""A."" Forget it."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, so let's switch."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi...
Phoebe Buffay,It's...
Phoebe Buffay,and...
Phoebe Buffay,"Please...wait, how did you do that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, let's go running!"
Phoebe Buffay,Let's run towards them!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Phoebe Buffay,"I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Why would you do that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself."
Phoebe Buffay,"Please Rachel, I am not an idiot."
Phoebe Buffay,Sure
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what should you have done?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-Huh, Which is...?"
Phoebe Buffay,So?
Phoebe Buffay,Why do you care?
Phoebe Buffay,But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel?
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God. What happened?
Phoebe Buffay,Well that's great! Congratulations!!
Phoebe Buffay,You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Phoebe Buffay,Totally.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know."
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,"What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh.
Phoebe Buffay,Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Phoebe Buffay,But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?"
Phoebe Buffay,Just for a second.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, sleep with Kenny."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, yes it would."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!"
Phoebe Buffay,And who else is going to be there?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know ""Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad"" and now he's he's ""Jack Geller, dream hunk."""
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk."
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, leave him alone!"
Phoebe Buffay,"So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Phoebe Buffay,I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack."
Phoebe Buffay,"I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen."
Phoebe Buffay,"Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman."
Phoebe Buffay,I love Jacques Cousteau!
Phoebe Buffay,That is nice and we're done. TADA!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, we do it every year!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us that wily minx."
Phoebe Buffay,But we have to!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well then, you should look with us."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that's it? A great idea!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, who's it for?"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, we never do that"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Look who I found!
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden."
Phoebe Buffay,"Or we could just follow your clever jokes &#150; any ideas? No! Didn't think so! Okay, c'mon guys, show us where the presents are!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, how about my azzz?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, don't look directly at them!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, no, we could look at them!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this one's for Chandler. Here."
Phoebe Buffay,And the big one's for me!
Phoebe Buffay,Hee hee!
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Will you get us better gifts?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless."
Phoebe Buffay,"She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, we'll see."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, a flea market?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium."
Phoebe Buffay,How much was it?
Phoebe Buffay,500 bucks at a flea market?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay,A dollar?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, what period is it from?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or..."
Phoebe Buffay,"White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sure!
Phoebe Buffay,"You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh sure! Noo!
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, where did you get this?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!"
Phoebe Buffay,Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that."
Phoebe Buffay,Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Phoebe Buffay,Ah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk."
Phoebe Buffay,No! I do want to!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!"
Phoebe Buffay,No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
Phoebe Buffay,That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
Phoebe Buffay,But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
Phoebe Buffay,But at least the apothecary table is real.
Phoebe Buffay,I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?"
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. Me neither.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,I guess it was kinda funny.
Phoebe Buffay,Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, you're not a pushover."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"That true, I am flaky."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, totally."
Phoebe Buffay,That's great. Good for you guys.
Phoebe Buffay,Who said you were?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything."
Phoebe Buffay,Really? I've heard better.
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! That is a bad audition.
Phoebe Buffay,"Rach, you're in my seat."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, I kinda thought."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah Joey that is so gross!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm pretty.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere."
Phoebe Buffay,Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
Phoebe Buffay,"Never mind, I got it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I like cards."
Phoebe Buffay,"Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea."
Phoebe Buffay,I would love that job!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, we went shopping!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sorry Jill.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know ""I want a job sweater."""
Phoebe Buffay,"And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you never heard of them?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay then.
Phoebe Buffay,"But great news about the apartment pants, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah me too.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, what's going on there?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh Chandler!
Phoebe Buffay,So that story doesn't make you cry?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Phoebe Buffay,It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God. So-so you're making porn movies.
Phoebe Buffay,You're making one right now!
Phoebe Buffay,And-and you're using my name!
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, I'm talking right now! You're-you mean her."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for."
Phoebe Buffay,No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
Phoebe Buffay,"Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,No! Barry and Mindy.
Phoebe Buffay,Which time?
Phoebe Buffay,What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks."
Phoebe Buffay,"Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name."
Phoebe Buffay,No-no!! No!!
Phoebe Buffay,"No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars."
Phoebe Buffay,"What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts."
Phoebe Buffay,"My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?"
Phoebe Buffay,Then yes that is what I'm having.
Phoebe Buffay,"Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan."
Phoebe Buffay,So what's going on with you?
Phoebe Buffay,Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Phoebe Buffay,How long has it been since you had sex?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's not so bad.
Phoebe Buffay,That is.
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, dirty talk, mnage trois, toys..."
Phoebe Buffay,Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects."
Phoebe Buffay,No! It's not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay! Okay! I'm so glad you're here.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, give it to me."
Phoebe Buffay,Give it!
Phoebe Buffay,Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Phoebe Buffay,Thank God.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!"
Phoebe Buffay,"What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!"
Phoebe Buffay,What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!"
Phoebe Buffay,I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
Phoebe Buffay,No. I've learned my lesson.
Phoebe Buffay,"Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder."
Phoebe Buffay,Surprise! Look who's back!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, I don't think so!"
Phoebe Buffay,Jack!! Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,Nu-uh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count-Anyway, I'll be in my office."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's all right, I'll work here. This is goo, next to this plant."
Phoebe Buffay,"You're in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, so this is all about money! Y'know it's bad enough that-Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm having another heart attack!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!
Phoebe Buffay,Dumbass!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, they fired me and I'm having heart attack."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see.../One of them won't do it, but the second one will set you free.../Tell all your hate and anger, it's time to say good-bye.../And that is just what I will do, soon as those bastards I work for die!/La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la......"
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, y'know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you've got y'know a little of this goin' on. Wow! I still have it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, we can kick anybody's ass!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah it is! It is! It's freshwater eel!
Phoebe Buffay,Come on Ross. We're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Phoebe Buffay,You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!"
Phoebe Buffay,You guys!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?"
Phoebe Buffay,What is that?
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! Oh for crying out loud!
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, it's you little bunny friend."
Phoebe Buffay,Ross!!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, you're a freak!!"
Phoebe Buffay,DANGER!!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Pat Sajak?
Phoebe Buffay,Alex Trebek?
Phoebe Buffay,Chuck Woolery?
Phoebe Buffay,Say we are unagi!
Phoebe Buffay,No Rachel! They got here first!
Phoebe Buffay,Why is Ross doing that?
Phoebe Buffay,We should help him!
Phoebe Buffay,What's a Movement class?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! How bad was it?
Phoebe Buffay,Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room."
Phoebe Buffay,What's that smell?
Phoebe Buffay,So did you sleep well last night?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
Phoebe Buffay,Gum!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't use a curling iron.
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,"What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here."
Phoebe Buffay,"I can smell it a little, bake the pie."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'll be out in a second."
Phoebe Buffay,That doesn't lock does it?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!"
Phoebe Buffay,No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
Phoebe Buffay,All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Phoebe Buffay,"God, what a mess."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, sly."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh that's good, I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo."
Phoebe Buffay,'Cause that's just your taste.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these"
Phoebe Buffay,A chin dimple!
Phoebe Buffay,Have you seen your guy's body?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He's a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, like there are police for that!"
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Chandler funny?"
Phoebe Buffay,My guy is well read.
Phoebe Buffay,My guy has great teeth!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,What did you do on yours?
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, what the hell is this?!"
Phoebe Buffay,You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Phoebe Buffay,"So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No reason, it's just I know a single guy that cares about other people."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, so do a lot of people."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, y'know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you'd like to take to a ball? ""Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?"" ""Uhh, okay-I gotta go!"""
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y'know you might even end up with someone really special if you pick my guy.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay sure!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, you can't tell her not to go. You just started dating."
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing, you just have to be cool with it."
Phoebe Buffay,This is Patrick.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, you're right! I am too late; they're sitting on the couch and talking! Come on! Rachel?"
Phoebe Buffay,This is Patrick.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Okay! Yeah, that's okay. Have a seat."
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel? Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay, let's talk it out."
Phoebe Buffay,Then why did she ask us to...
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, look! That's Elizabeth!"
Phoebe Buffay,You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God.
Phoebe Buffay,I am extremely talented!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I mean I was really acting my ass off."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me."
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! I'll do it without you! I don't need you or anybody else! I'm gonna make it on my own! You'll see!! You'll all see!!
Phoebe Buffay,I am.
Phoebe Buffay,Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until..."
Phoebe Buffay,And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's not that bad.
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!"
Phoebe Buffay,Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass."
Phoebe Buffay,I know! I know! I know!
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
Phoebe Buffay,"There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
Phoebe Buffay,"I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, ""Ooh, where'd Ross go?"""
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,He's holding us back.
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Joey, you're going to be great!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'll be waiting.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I'm just deciding which one to use-I'm gonna start writing another book!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut."
Phoebe Buffay,I want to see what he wants first.
Phoebe Buffay,"You're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Not looking for dates.
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, I'm sorry, could you please talk a little slower?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's about relationships. Y'know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!"
Phoebe Buffay,And how none of it matters when the people really love each other. And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, why don't you just get him fired?"
Phoebe Buffay,"""You wish."""
Phoebe Buffay,I'm not writing about you! I'm writing about other people.
Phoebe Buffay,Marcia and Chester.
Phoebe Buffay,I see what you're doing!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,I know what time you said.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said."
Phoebe Buffay,"Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up."
Phoebe Buffay,I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks! So are you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Mon... Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they're supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks it's at seven."
Phoebe Buffay,That's right.
Phoebe Buffay,Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, you guys."
Phoebe Buffay,Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Phoebe Buffay,No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay that's so generous!
Phoebe Buffay,Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!"
Phoebe Buffay,"So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, and then lunch."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list."
Phoebe Buffay,Me too!
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?"
Phoebe Buffay,Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Phoebe Buffay,Don't even get me started on yours!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,No! Why?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!"
Phoebe Buffay,What are you gonna do?
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel said that!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, ""Son of a bitch?"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, maybe ask this guy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, what did he do?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we should go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, did she buy it?"
Phoebe Buffay,So did Heldi show you the place?
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, have you told anyone else?"
Phoebe Buffay,You told me.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, coffeehouse."
Phoebe Buffay,So how are things going with Paul?
Phoebe Buffay,That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
Phoebe Buffay,No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Phoebe Buffay,Watch this.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Paul!
Phoebe Buffay,So how are things going with you?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! That was so weird, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Please, I think you know why."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper."
Phoebe Buffay,Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
Phoebe Buffay,Well then I think that's it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner."
Phoebe Buffay,Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Or not, whatever."
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?"
Phoebe Buffay,We will give you $10.
Phoebe Buffay,We stand firm at $10.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10."
Phoebe Buffay,I'll give you $1 for them.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!"
Phoebe Buffay,Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
Phoebe Buffay,The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring."
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe it was the guy.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Phoebe Buffay,Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
Phoebe Buffay,There he is!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call."
Phoebe Buffay,It is your office.
Phoebe Buffay,John?
Phoebe Buffay,Here he is.
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! I would trade.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity..."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"If she says no, can I have the ring?"
Phoebe Buffay,If!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Monica.
Phoebe Buffay,It's gone.
Phoebe Buffay,We're practically kissing.
Phoebe Buffay,Open bar?
Phoebe Buffay,I can do that for the kids.
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, you are 12 years older than her."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Oop!
Phoebe Buffay,Here.
Phoebe Buffay,So now what's going on here?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know what a silent is I meant, what's going on with your hair?"
Phoebe Buffay,No! It's nice!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hi."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey you guys! Look!
Phoebe Buffay,I got me some drinks!
Phoebe Buffay,Open bar!
Phoebe Buffay,You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
Phoebe Buffay,Forget her! You enjoy this!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, just buy the damn boat!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm just helping the kids!
Phoebe Buffay,"Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, en chante."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!"
Phoebe Buffay,I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Phoebe Buffay,"Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out."
Phoebe Buffay,What happened?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor..."
Phoebe Buffay,Good one! Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, they're gonna be so happy together."
Phoebe Buffay,Not that often!
Phoebe Buffay,Me too! So happy for them!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!"
Phoebe Buffay,Totally. I'm like 90/10.
Phoebe Buffay,Definitely!
Phoebe Buffay,What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay,You mean a backup?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah I got that."
Phoebe Buffay,Hm-mmm.
Phoebe Buffay,Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well hey, it's just a backup."
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm talking about massages.
Phoebe Buffay,Good!
Phoebe Buffay,Left! Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah absolutely!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, let her stay out there. It's sweet."
Phoebe Buffay,"So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh honey no, you ate it all."
Phoebe Buffay,"Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. ""First Time I Met Chandler, I Thought He Was Gay. But here I am singing on his wedding day!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though."
Phoebe Buffay,Why?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away."
Phoebe Buffay,Would she?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I see."
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, I don't really their permission."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes."
Phoebe Buffay,They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Phoebe Buffay,"""Whenever I get married, guess who won't get to sing? Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"""We thought Phoebe would leave, but she just stayed and stayed. That's right, I'm here all night, and Chandler will never get l..."""
Phoebe Buffay,Oh thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Now... ""Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning."
Phoebe Buffay,It starts?
Phoebe Buffay,That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,"I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?"
Phoebe Buffay,Nothing-Why?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Ross, hi."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, let's talk outside."
Phoebe Buffay,What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!"
Phoebe Buffay,My God! What did you order?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with."
Phoebe Buffay,Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Phoebe Buffay,"My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon."
Phoebe Buffay,He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!"
Phoebe Buffay,So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Phoebe Buffay,Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Phoebe Buffay,You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Phoebe Buffay,You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Phoebe Buffay,"Break my heart-Oh, all right."
Phoebe Buffay,"If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Your own boat?
Phoebe Buffay,I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Phoebe Buffay,"Because I'm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, here I wish you health and happiness."
Phoebe Buffay,"See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left."
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,You do?
Phoebe Buffay,That and arrogance.
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is this crumb. I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, it's not that big a deal!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but not as good as batch 17."
Phoebe Buffay,Are there anymore from the good batch? 'Cause we could just work off of those.
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that's not happening 'til October 15th, 2032."
Phoebe Buffay,That's what you think.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, y'know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse."
Phoebe Buffay,Nesele Toulouse.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!! Ohh.
Phoebe Buffay,I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why you're burning in hell!!
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I don't know. I can't lie to him again. Oh no I-no! I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, yeah that's right."
Phoebe Buffay,What? You mean behind my back?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don't hire an assistant because they're cute, you hire them because they're qualified."
Phoebe Buffay,"Let's see. Oh my God! Oh... But no! No! You can't-you can't hire him, because that-it's not professional. Umm, this is for me yes? Thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey-Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,What happened?
Phoebe Buffay,You! An actor?! That's madness!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,You must be Hilda.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number."
Phoebe Buffay,So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Phoebe Buffay,But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh Willie's still alive!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!"
Phoebe Buffay,He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
Phoebe Buffay,You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
Phoebe Buffay,So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Phoebe Buffay,I'm having a really good time!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, don't freak out. I'll go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?"
Phoebe Buffay,Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Ginger.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't have it!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, okay Sherlock!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Phoebe Buffay,Watching ballroom dancing?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!"
Phoebe Buffay,And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Phoebe Buffay,You're still gonna go out with her?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!"
Phoebe Buffay,No listen to me! She is crazy!
Phoebe Buffay,You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom."
Phoebe Buffay,You think he's emotionally unavailable?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997."
Phoebe Buffay,We want the last six years back!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh he knows! For the most part.
Phoebe Buffay,Both of you together?
Phoebe Buffay,What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh right, because you're so capable of change."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to."
Phoebe Buffay,"And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Potato, Potaato."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, let's see it!"
Phoebe Buffay,You guys make a very attractive couple.
Phoebe Buffay,I hope it's you.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!!! Oh!!
Phoebe Buffay,Still.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wh-why is that the best part?
Phoebe Buffay,"Aww, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Rachel?
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Well, if that's what you want..."
Phoebe Buffay,But why does it even matter?!
Phoebe Buffay,Because this one is now! And-and it's two of our best friends! Who knows what you're gonna marry!
Phoebe Buffay,"You wouldn't! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I've never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you've done it at least twice!"
Phoebe Buffay,"And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. Oh I guess that was it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you so much! Okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh I know.
Phoebe Buffay,See? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie!
Phoebe Buffay,"Na-uh, I am!"
Phoebe Buffay,Because I cared enough to lie!
Phoebe Buffay,What are you talking about?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's better than us deciding."
Phoebe Buffay,No! Coins hate me!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey there, you handsome thing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, what a kiss ass."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! Your honor?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! I won!
Phoebe Buffay,The coins have finally forgiven me!
Phoebe Buffay,"Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"That's ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. Oh, you mean today."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's so sweet thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh.
Phoebe Buffay,This stuff is great!
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor."
Phoebe Buffay,Because I think it means more to you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?"
Phoebe Buffay,Man alive!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,And call me!
Phoebe Buffay,We want you to marry her!
Phoebe Buffay,She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you always say that."
Phoebe Buffay,Whatever.
Phoebe Buffay,Secret affair!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay,A birthday party.
Phoebe Buffay,Allison's birthday party.
Phoebe Buffay,32.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?"
Phoebe Buffay,Didn't you sleep together?
Phoebe Buffay,Then change it back!
Phoebe Buffay,No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Phoebe Buffay,Does Joey have any idea?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and maybe that you're a real"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"So how was, how was your date?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery."
Phoebe Buffay,"Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's not!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, who's this?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, there's no dog here?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god! Where are you?
Phoebe Buffay,They're here already? How are they doing this?
Phoebe Buffay,There's no dog in here.
Phoebe Buffay,"No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?"
Phoebe Buffay,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you crazy?
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,You don't like ice cream?
Phoebe Buffay,All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'd say about a month."
Phoebe Buffay,"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know."
Phoebe Buffay,I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Where's Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,Wash your hands!!!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom."
Phoebe Buffay,"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, is Chandler here?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't."
Phoebe Buffay,"We have good news, look whose back!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?"
Phoebe Buffay,"His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!"
Phoebe Buffay,I never had a bike of my own.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on."
Phoebe Buffay,No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Phoebe Buffay,"Not really, I got to drag him around too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sure!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God Ross!!
Phoebe Buffay,I love it!!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Phoebe Buffay,Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, uh-huh so much!"
Phoebe Buffay,Of course!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. See?
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!"
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Why do I have to learn?
Phoebe Buffay,What kind of an emergency?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star."
Phoebe Buffay,You won't let go?
Phoebe Buffay,Swear?!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Well...
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Weee!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Phoebe Buffay,I am shocked! Shocked!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hello liar."
Phoebe Buffay,I could've been killed I hope you know!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects."
Phoebe Buffay,What?! What the hell?!
Phoebe Buffay,What?! Why?!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay Ross! Please don't die!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Haaaa... ... ahhhh!
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, it's my mom's."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it."
Phoebe Buffay,And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, you guys!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, why not?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?"
Phoebe Buffay,You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Phoebe Buffay,"Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y'know? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"" Y'know? You gotta take care of yourselves! In this world history teaches us nothing!"
Phoebe Buffay,"So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y'know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!"
Phoebe Buffay,That's fun.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums."
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe on some level.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Joey, I got you another present."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here."
Phoebe Buffay,Our apartment is ready.
Phoebe Buffay,Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe Buffay,Hm?
Phoebe Buffay,Fish!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here..."
Phoebe Buffay,"We did have fun, didn't we?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yay, okay!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they've made so many changes I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore-Ooh! New sconces!"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up."
Phoebe Buffay,There's a skylight?! Wow!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that."
Phoebe Buffay,"A little bit, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Phoebe Buffay,Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh me too.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I do not hear that."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?"
Phoebe Buffay,Absolutely!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys."
Phoebe Buffay,Duly noted.
Phoebe Buffay,Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
Phoebe Buffay,So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it does."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you wore me down."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! That's David!
Phoebe Buffay,"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around."
Phoebe Buffay,David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Phoebe Buffay,Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! Oh no!
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I have plans with Joey tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,"No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!"
Phoebe Buffay,Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli."
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm very wise. I know."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"God Joey, this is taking forever!"
Phoebe Buffay,W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
Phoebe Buffay,Well... It's a date.
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this."
Phoebe Buffay,"That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me."
Phoebe Buffay,She was?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I wouldn't miss this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...
Phoebe Buffay,That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
Phoebe Buffay,"That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else."
Phoebe Buffay,You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
Phoebe Buffay,I do too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow."
Phoebe Buffay,No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back."
Phoebe Buffay,"There it is! Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that's pretty amazing too."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!"
Phoebe Buffay,Shh! Get me out of here.
Phoebe Buffay,Please don't be a space ship. Please don't be a space ship. Oh thank God! How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can...
Phoebe Buffay,Don't interrupt me!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's not mine.
Phoebe Buffay,How do you know?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!"
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Phoebe Buffay,"There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!"
Phoebe Buffay,What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, I hate this year!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well okay, it's already February and I've only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that's right!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y'know, I probably wouldn't have to say spank as much."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, like you never called!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh okay. Umm, all right. Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh okay, well I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Yeah you're right, this is easy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, all right...um, no offense, but you were kind of rude."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"No. Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please? Earl, thanks. Hi Earl, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner."
Phoebe Buffay,May I ask why?
Phoebe Buffay,I surely do!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, is-is that because you're out of toner?"
Phoebe Buffay,No-no wait-wait! I can't just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?"
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,"No look, I-I'm sure that people know you exist!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Earl, you're not hearing me! All I'm saying is that you're not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right so Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there's gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh sorry, boyfriend!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, whatever! Anything!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, he's gotta go."
Phoebe Buffay,No! I'm not finished yet! Don't! Don't you dare hang up on me!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He's the supply manager around here.
Phoebe Buffay,Earl! I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, look it, you-you can't kill yourself."
Phoebe Buffay,No-no I can't! I can't let you do it!
Phoebe Buffay,Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Think about it okay? This isn't even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you're my first call! And-and somebody else might've hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,I'm not gonna give you tips! Look don't you see that this-this...this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's fate!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure! Umm, where are you from?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I've got-I've got goose bumps."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm."
Phoebe Buffay,"But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you."
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me."
Phoebe Buffay,"I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well get in line missy. So, can I have a ride stud?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, who's next?"
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! 'Cause y'know that hurts.
Phoebe Buffay,Least of all you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Okay, I'm gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right, here we go. Haul ass!!!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Happy thirtieth birthday! Here! It's for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!"
Phoebe Buffay,Because it's our thirtieth birthday.
Phoebe Buffay,Wait!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Nu-uh!
Phoebe Buffay,You have your birth certificate?
Phoebe Buffay,Our mom.
Phoebe Buffay,Do you have my birth certificate?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31."
Phoebe Buffay,I just lost a whole year of my life.
Phoebe Buffay,Your middle name is Pamela?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's my first name.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, what's going on?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother."
Phoebe Buffay,"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop."
Phoebe Buffay,Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!
Phoebe Buffay,Wooo!! Hoo!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay quick, help me get this off!"
Phoebe Buffay,I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!
Phoebe Buffay,"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I'll see you guys later. Thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,You did the right thing.
Phoebe Buffay,"Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah? Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, he left his cell phone."
Phoebe Buffay,Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Phoebe Buffay,"That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex."
Phoebe Buffay,No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Phoebe Buffay,Nice try.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know.
Phoebe Buffay,Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone."
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide."
Phoebe Buffay,Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you."
Phoebe Buffay,"So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Good.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, now you lost me."
Phoebe Buffay,No I didn't!
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,That is a different phone.
Phoebe Buffay,That is damning evidence.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone."
Phoebe Buffay,"Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide."
Phoebe Buffay,What?! That's the first time today!
Phoebe Buffay,Who is it?
Phoebe Buffay,Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Phoebe Buffay,Because it's my apartment!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Phoebe Buffay,"Could you-could you umm, give us one second?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wh-what do we do?
Phoebe Buffay,Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! You're such a great friend!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
Phoebe Buffay,Nice!
Phoebe Buffay,Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Phoebe Buffay,With what?
Phoebe Buffay,Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe Buffay,No! No! It's-it's uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!
Phoebe Buffay,What?! No! It was my idea!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, you've got to stop chattering!"
Phoebe Buffay,What is it?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, I don't believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,It's amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I love you Hexadrin! Oh look! It comes with a story!"
Phoebe Buffay,Say what?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache-Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don't recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I'm sorry, extra strength death capsules!"
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, then I must be disoriented."
Phoebe Buffay,I feel like my face is swelling. Is my face swelling?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!"
Phoebe Buffay,Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's totally meant to be. Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,I know! Robin is so gay!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two actually had hooked up."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's like huge weight has been lifted! 'Cause look, no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I'm just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria-Oh."
Phoebe Buffay,Since when are you into swing music?
Phoebe Buffay,What is your job?
Phoebe Buffay,Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!"
Phoebe Buffay,Got it.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm coming! I'm coming!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay! Hey! What do I do?!! What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Phoebe Buffay,Did you find the dress?
Phoebe Buffay,I-We gotta get Monica.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!! Excuse me! Excuse me!
Phoebe Buffay,I know. Hand me a tissue.
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Does that mean Carcass is available?
Phoebe Buffay,Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, swing music is so out."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go."
Phoebe Buffay,Good for you!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Phoebe Buffay,Go for it.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill."
Phoebe Buffay,"I did, but that was really fun."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck."
Phoebe Buffay,"All I could think of was y'know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself."
Phoebe Buffay,I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
Phoebe Buffay,You sound like a guy.
Phoebe Buffay,You'll have a last kiss.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay bye.
Phoebe Buffay,Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Phoebe Buffay,I miss you too!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,No. Why?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute."
Phoebe Buffay,No that is the last thing you want to do!
Phoebe Buffay,Because you're marrying him!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband."
Phoebe Buffay,"That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
Phoebe Buffay,Rach?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. It's just so unexpected! I...I uh...Boy I'll tell you it's just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y'know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in...
Phoebe Buffay,...in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon. Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words.
Phoebe Buffay,"Please, don't play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey! How was your audition?
Phoebe Buffay,What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! You got it?!
Phoebe Buffay,"The next, next?"
Phoebe Buffay,What's the matter?
Phoebe Buffay,Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Well when can we have this shower?
Phoebe Buffay,Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, calm down!"
Phoebe Buffay,Just calm down woman!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, here. What time?"
Phoebe Buffay,Finger sandwiches and tea.
Phoebe Buffay,And chili!
Phoebe Buffay,Both!
Phoebe Buffay,Neither.
Phoebe Buffay,Lusts of the flesh.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. A cowboy theme?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Hey Rach?
Phoebe Buffay,Who the hell are all these people?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know.
Phoebe Buffay,You were supposed to tell her!
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine, I'll go call her."
Phoebe Buffay,And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave."
Phoebe Buffay,We ruined everything.
Phoebe Buffay,Sur-surprise.
Phoebe Buffay,"Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! No problem! I...
Phoebe Buffay,Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Phoebe Buffay,I like our way. Oh! Chess!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?"
Phoebe Buffay,What is this? What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,Joey's!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm sure that happened."
Phoebe Buffay,Sure!
Phoebe Buffay,Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay! I just-I didn't know that you are a lesbian.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you're so-y'know so...vanilla."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,To Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel, it's okay. You don't have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa."
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Phoebe Buffay,I've had better.
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing."
Phoebe Buffay,Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Phoebe Buffay,CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Phoebe Buffay,YOU KNOW?!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Get in here!!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own"
Phoebe Buffay,Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!"
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!"
Phoebe Buffay,He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra."
Phoebe Buffay,You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh.
Phoebe Buffay,Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Phoebe Buffay,And why not?!
Phoebe Buffay,You're-you're what?!
Phoebe Buffay,"I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things."
Phoebe Buffay,"How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that's beautiful."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"I've never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I think I need to do some shopping."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey sweetie!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back."
Phoebe Buffay,What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,I know. They were mine.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm wearing his briefs right now.
Phoebe Buffay,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Phoebe Buffay,And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Phoebe Buffay,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.
Phoebe Buffay,I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay whatever.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Huh.
Phoebe Buffay,That's great Joe!
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Hmm?
Phoebe Buffay,I think it's important that you do.
Phoebe Buffay,Feel better?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I understand."
Phoebe Buffay,Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,What are they?
Phoebe Buffay,That play?
Phoebe Buffay,The movie?
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!"
Phoebe Buffay,Congratulations!
Phoebe Buffay,Go ahead.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes! Very good.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, please! My make-up!"
Phoebe Buffay,What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Phoebe Buffay,"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh man.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Well there's one down.
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
Phoebe Buffay,Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!"
Phoebe Buffay,No-no! I-I...I found one.
Phoebe Buffay,Sure. Do you need some floss?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh here's a whole bunch.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this."
Phoebe Buffay,Right.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it."
Phoebe Buffay,You told them he was missing?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. I'm going with you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?"
Phoebe Buffay,All right. Good luck.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Is that him?
Phoebe Buffay,"He could be in disguise, y'know."
Phoebe Buffay,What the hell are you doing?!
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?!
Phoebe Buffay,"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again..."
Phoebe Buffay,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,You know?!
Phoebe Buffay,What? You'll hi-ya?
Phoebe Buffay,Cigarettes?!!
Phoebe Buffay,Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?"
Phoebe Buffay,"We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't say.
Phoebe Buffay,I can't say because he's famous.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby."
Phoebe Buffay,What?! Well he never said that to me!
Phoebe Buffay,How about just the bridemaids?
Phoebe Buffay,It is.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Phoebe Buffay,Sneaky.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,"So, are you ready to talk about it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Now?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, we'll talk about something else then."
Phoebe Buffay,Who's the father?!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop."
Phoebe Buffay,"Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!"
Phoebe Buffay,Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, ""James, James Brolin, are you sure?"" James Brolin said..."
Phoebe Buffay,What?! Why bother?
Phoebe Buffay,Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
Phoebe Buffay,"When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure."
Phoebe Buffay,I'll run out and get you one.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, she won't tell us."
Phoebe Buffay,See? This is why you register.
Phoebe Buffay,30 seconds.
Phoebe Buffay,It's time.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, it's negative."
Phoebe Buffay,It's negative.
Phoebe Buffay,Here.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's positive."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's-it's not negative, it's positive."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well yeah, I lied before."
Phoebe Buffay,Now you know how you really feel about it.
Phoebe Buffay,With who?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. Y'know, it's probably this one."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah that's right Chandler does still think I'm pregnant. He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. After you of course."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?! I think he's cute.
Phoebe Buffay,Believe me I'm trying.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You're like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism."
Phoebe Buffay,"Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy doesn't have a clue! He's just walking down the street thinking, 'I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!' then bam! He's a father and everything's different."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he's walking around thinking, 'Do I want to be a dad?' and then bam!"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah. That's me.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby!"
Phoebe Buffay,You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
Phoebe Buffay,David Lynn.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank God, 'cause that hair on a baby..."
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,Bus?
Phoebe Buffay,Well-well but it is huge.
Phoebe Buffay,"You're thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It's like, it's like ripping off this Band-Aid. Quick and painless, watch. Oh mother of...See?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Hell yeah! I'll marry you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey lady, your day's over! It's my turn!"
Phoebe Buffay,I can and I will!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,It's Joey!
Phoebe Buffay,We don't know.
Phoebe Buffay,Who? Who is it?
Phoebe Buffay,Was that story over?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! I know who the father is...
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I may play the fool at times, but I'm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit. I believe this belongs to the father of your baby."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Phoebe Buffay,Really? Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, sorry. Yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or...poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,What?!!
Phoebe Buffay,No!!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't say that didn't hurt. But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
Phoebe Buffay,Wait you stole those from these people's wedding?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
Phoebe Buffay,"It was his sweater, but-Oh my God!"
Phoebe Buffay,Me too!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, bye."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon."
Phoebe Buffay,All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
Phoebe Buffay,What?! They took mine to give to you!
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe they don't trust us.
Phoebe Buffay,You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?
Phoebe Buffay,No you didn't.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!"
Phoebe Buffay,What stuff?
Phoebe Buffay,Did Rachel find you?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh she was looking for you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, she really wanted to talk to you now."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,And?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh sorry. And?!
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe it's something you ate?
Phoebe Buffay,Of course I do! And I'm gonna give it back to you as soon as they're done with it at the key shining place.
Phoebe Buffay,Well why don't you use your key?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! We could have done that.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? 'Cause y'know umm, they don't-they don't have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no.
Phoebe Buffay,Didn't you two already talk?
Phoebe Buffay,Holy mother of God!!!
Phoebe Buffay,That is brand new information!!
Phoebe Buffay,A little bit.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh hey hi, he's doing it. He's breaking down the door. Okay, we're in."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! So how was the doctor?
Phoebe Buffay,Good.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Come on in!
Phoebe Buffay,So how was the honeymoon?
Phoebe Buffay,That was the best part? Good honeymooning tiger.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! Hi Greg, I'm Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg."
Phoebe Buffay,You have got to be kidding me!
Phoebe Buffay,Monica! That's not right! Start with where.
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!
Phoebe Buffay,Greg and Jenny?
Phoebe Buffay,You got fake numbered.
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!"
Phoebe Buffay,"That's like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!"
Phoebe Buffay,Regina Philange.
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay fine! Fine! We'll just have to think of some other way to put the whole 'Who came onto who,' thing to rest! Come on now, think!!"
Phoebe Buffay,You're gonna get pregnant.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you came on to Ross!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Dinner was good!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well hello there."
Phoebe Buffay,I didn't see this on the menu.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, so you're Monica's boss?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! I sous stand.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you...you made pesto?
Phoebe Buffay,Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
Phoebe Buffay,I made it myself.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's no pesto."
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him."
Phoebe Buffay,But why?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two."
Phoebe Buffay,"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?"
Phoebe Buffay,"That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too."
Phoebe Buffay,Love it!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,But...
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today."
Phoebe Buffay,Because I'm dumping him today.
Phoebe Buffay,"He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Then he comes over! ""I'm so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!"
Phoebe Buffay,"You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself."
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy."
Phoebe Buffay,Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I...
Phoebe Buffay,Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
Phoebe Buffay,Monica!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm breaking up with you!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm, I'm breaking up with you."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm...I'm just not ready for a relationship right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too."
Phoebe Buffay,"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good!
Phoebe Buffay,Now wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ursula! Wait! Err-err, it's me! Phoebe!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a second! So, what's new with you?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Huh. Okay. Well, I'm really happy for you."
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Okay. Umm, y'know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you're marrying."
Phoebe Buffay,"By the way, it's a costume party."
Phoebe Buffay,No. But thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's me. Phoebe!"
Phoebe Buffay,That is so you!
Phoebe Buffay,No wonder your pregnant.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are."
Phoebe Buffay,Ursula's fiance?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,My mother killed herself.
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no! That's okay, we'll just start over. Okay? Hi! I'm Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Why are you looking at me like that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. So, what are you?"
Phoebe Buffay,No I-I meant your costume.
Phoebe Buffay,I love the second grade!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! It's so much better than first grade when you don't know what's going on and definitely better than third grade. Y'know with all the politics and mind games.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I'm a masseuse...by day."
Phoebe Buffay,No I'm having fun. I'm really-And I'm really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. Ursula's fiance is really sweet! He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y'know normally y'know, I don't like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,No I'm not! You are!
Phoebe Buffay,Hello handsome. Oh God. Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Phoebe Buffay,Two weeks? That's it?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh really?
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,"Peace Corps, really?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi liar!
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know the only reason he's marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Phoebe Buffay,But they're not!
Phoebe Buffay,Why are you lying to him?
Phoebe Buffay,You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Phoebe Buffay,Hmm?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure it does. Yeah, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm listen, I don't think...I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay I can't let you do this! She's lying to you.
Phoebe Buffay,"She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Yeah-Not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. Okay, here's the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here's her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I almost don't want to show this. Just remember I'm a minute younger."
Phoebe Buffay,"No. You're not, you're not stupid."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just...you did it with the wrong person. What?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you should."
Phoebe Buffay,Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
Phoebe Buffay,I never get calls!! Hello?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
Phoebe Buffay,Shhh! I'm talking.
Phoebe Buffay,Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
Phoebe Buffay,No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
Phoebe Buffay,"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours."
Phoebe Buffay,"I've got friends too. Okay, bye."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe this is too weird.
Phoebe Buffay,No don't tear out your eyes!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later."
Phoebe Buffay,Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,What sex?
Phoebe Buffay,We didn't have sex.
Phoebe Buffay,Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Phoebe Buffay,You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!
Phoebe Buffay,You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
Phoebe Buffay,So I guess this is it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, so do you."
Phoebe Buffay,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure. Yeah, he's kinda sexy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Oh well, I will be there!"
Phoebe Buffay,Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Phoebe Buffay,Your secret bachelorette party...
Phoebe Buffay,She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I-I don't eat meat."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I don't eat that either."
Phoebe Buffay,"He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss."
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel!
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?"
Phoebe Buffay,It's slang for pregnant.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah."
Phoebe Buffay,It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Phoebe Buffay,I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.
Phoebe Buffay,"That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a break!"" ""No we weren't!"" What happened to you two?!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, you told your dad the truth."
Phoebe Buffay,Wanna go see a movie?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,I brought you my old maternity clothes!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons."
Phoebe Buffay,"Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe Buffay,Anything I can do to help?
Phoebe Buffay,Sure!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,I don't believe you! That is...brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don't think I can help you after all, I didn't realize this game was on."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well normally I don't, but y'know......Green Bay is playing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well it's only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it's not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. Wow! Well done.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Green Bay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay...Mermen."
Phoebe Buffay,I think you do.
Phoebe Buffay,What?! What else did you do?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,"So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?"
Phoebe Buffay,I wanna join!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn't go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.
Phoebe Buffay,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Phoebe Buffay,Is there anything we can do for you?
Phoebe Buffay,How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can't wait to hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There's a trick."""
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Ross! Doesn't Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Phoebe Buffay,Sting has a son that goes there too!
Phoebe Buffay,You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Sting's son, seven years old and there's a picture."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it's New York magazine. It's an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, yeah that's too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it's totally sold out. I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I'll take you."
Phoebe Buffay,"There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That's why you have kids!"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! They're beautiful!
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Well then get your money back and return them!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,How come?!
Phoebe Buffay,Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!"
Phoebe Buffay,Your kid is seven?! He's really small. Please! Please get the tickets!
Phoebe Buffay,Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Phoebe Buffay,Rosssss can!
Phoebe Buffay,Rossss can!
Phoebe Buffay,Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, there you are Ben!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son."
Phoebe Buffay,"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers."
Phoebe Buffay,Him you're friends with.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, I'm with Ben."
Phoebe Buffay,"I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Why else would I be here?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during."
Phoebe Buffay,"Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you. Four would be great."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!
Phoebe Buffay,The Police? Here? A reunion?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oo, where are the seats?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?"
Phoebe Buffay,Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill."
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know she has a face Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,Bye.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?"
Phoebe Buffay,You wish.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Phoebe Buffay,Ugh! Women!
Phoebe Buffay,Give her a key to your apartment.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, we hate that."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
Phoebe Buffay,Where?!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger."
Phoebe Buffay,"So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, he's here to have sex with you."
Phoebe Buffay,You're welcome.
Phoebe Buffay,"It's okay, he's a virgin."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone."
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So... I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! I got you a present!!
Phoebe Buffay,"I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Phoebe Buffay,I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
Phoebe Buffay,Do you really like it?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh really? What was your first?
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before--Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!"
Phoebe Buffay,Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
Phoebe Buffay,I know!
Phoebe Buffay,Don't touch me!!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Phoebe Buffay,Me too!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, by Sandrine."
Phoebe Buffay,How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Phoebe Buffay,I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Phoebe Buffay,"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?"
Phoebe Buffay,You guys?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, just as well, I broke this one."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Fine.
Phoebe Buffay,Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
Phoebe Buffay,Is it Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, then tell him to stop staring!"
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! Joey?! You don't say.
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Joey, I know."
Phoebe Buffay,I knooow.
Phoebe Buffay,I know about your feelings.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare."
Phoebe Buffay,"For God sakes, it's Rachel!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush."
Phoebe Buffay,"Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us."
Phoebe Buffay,Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?"
Phoebe Buffay,Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Phoebe Buffay,We're in the bathroom!
Phoebe Buffay,Mazel tov.
Phoebe Buffay,Tell us what?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I left my guitar here again."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Great! Umm...
Phoebe Buffay,So do you want to hang out or something?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh are you and Chandler...
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
Phoebe Buffay,You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! You're getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
Phoebe Buffay,You told me you hate massages!
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe this! How long as this been going on?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it has a name?"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay-Oop! Too late! I'm leaving! Come on Chandler let's go!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? You!"
Phoebe Buffay,Why won't you let me massage you?
Phoebe Buffay,Monica! We lived together for years! I've seen you naked!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm curious about the human body.
Phoebe Buffay,"But I'm a professional! And I'm really good! Look, if you're uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?"
Phoebe Buffay,It does! How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
Phoebe Buffay,"Potato, potaato."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you under the sheet?
Phoebe Buffay,"Great, let's begin. How's the pressure?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right, you just enjoy."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, I got that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay but you should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour."
Phoebe Buffay,I mean $500.
Phoebe Buffay,600.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on."
Phoebe Buffay,Really? There's nothing sexual about this? Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. What are you looking at?! I mean hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well not clients, lovers. But let's just y'know, try it again. Come back and-and we'll work through it."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,"Great! Okay, if you'll just excuse me. So, did you hear something you liked?"
Phoebe Buffay,That's it. Just relax.
Phoebe Buffay,Come on more!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you like that don't you?"
Phoebe Buffay,You want it there? You take it there baby!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, say my name. Say it! And now I'm going to cover you back up, and umm we're never doing this again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Hey, Rach!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you, too."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?"
Phoebe Buffay,"So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Monica, grow up!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate."
Phoebe Buffay,He-hee!
Phoebe Buffay,"This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!"
Phoebe Buffay,How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Phoebe Buffay,"Taffy, really? I've never had any."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?"
Phoebe Buffay,"she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment."
Phoebe Buffay,He's miserable! What happened to him?
Phoebe Buffay,What stuff?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey you guys!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, and you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, good."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well last night, I met Monica's."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half."
Phoebe Buffay,Well he's tall.
Phoebe Buffay,He has brown hair.
Phoebe Buffay,He works with food!
Phoebe Buffay,"Obviously, and he's British."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don."
Phoebe Buffay,Soul mate.
Phoebe Buffay,Soul mate.
Phoebe Buffay,Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...
Phoebe Buffay,"They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't worry, we'll find you someone else."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don't know how you fight that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm... Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hello.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe we will. Oh!"
Phoebe Buffay,Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, witty banter. Well done."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place..."
Phoebe Buffay,"I-I-I like, I like parties."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah I guess, a little."
Phoebe Buffay,"So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm-Well since I was fourteen."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh stop it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Umm look, you're coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! You do?
Phoebe Buffay,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh there it is.
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store..."
Phoebe Buffay,A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, we both can. And we both will."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you didn't have to come in with me."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?"
Phoebe Buffay,A little. Now you're talking.
Phoebe Buffay,I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Phoebe Buffay,She must've left.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is..."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,I'll go with you
Phoebe Buffay,Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Phoebe Buffay,"So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hm huh, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, that's not necessary."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, actually I don't eat..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm...."
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you just try one?
Phoebe Buffay,Then you better do it now.
Phoebe Buffay,Because I'm going to kill him
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
Phoebe Buffay,He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
Phoebe Buffay,You think?
Phoebe Buffay,"You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person."
Phoebe Buffay,What's that now?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh look it's Parker!
Phoebe Buffay,Oooh I love it!
Phoebe Buffay,Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Phoebe Buffay,Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh thank God.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Let's try something else, let's play a game."
Phoebe Buffay,Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
Phoebe Buffay,"But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!"
Phoebe Buffay,You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
Phoebe Buffay,"No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!"
Phoebe Buffay,Much less happy!
Phoebe Buffay,So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Finally! Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?"
Phoebe Buffay,I was just being polite!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I...I just think you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Phoebe Buffay."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh okay, it's P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in 'Ello there mate!"
Phoebe Buffay,Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh.
Phoebe Buffay,"No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, tough call."
Phoebe Buffay,Ewwww!!
Phoebe Buffay,Ewwww!!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, please!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people..."
Phoebe Buffay,No. Neither is mine.
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. I know, what's her number?"
Phoebe Buffay,Isn't it at three?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?"
Phoebe Buffay,What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so glad you could make it.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
Phoebe Buffay,"No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it."
Phoebe Buffay,For how long?
Phoebe Buffay,She can't hear you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her."
Phoebe Buffay,I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
Phoebe Buffay,"How about you less important people, let's open your presents!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this is from your friend at work."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Phoebe Buffay,Not if you were here.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not a thing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up..."
Phoebe Buffay,You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
Phoebe Buffay,You should be!
Phoebe Buffay,You got it!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Well did she know you two weren't married?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sounds like you're a little jealous.
Phoebe Buffay,Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Chandler, why so fancy?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, I think I know someone who does that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, just don't get your hopes up."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, the interview..."
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you don't know.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, when I first met you, you were like, ""Blah, blah, blah."" I was like, shhh!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?"
Phoebe Buffay,I can't help you.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Bing, what an unusual name."
Phoebe Buffay,"Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do."
Phoebe Buffay,I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Phoebe Buffay,You gotta go!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, don't worry. You're ready."
Phoebe Buffay,Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
Phoebe Buffay,I started that!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh I know, I've been there. I remember toward the end..."
Phoebe Buffay,Or you can do volunteer work.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? Phoebe, Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Burrrrr!
Phoebe Buffay,"Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress."
Phoebe Buffay,"When she comes out, you hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just right out of her."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I-I think it's still gonna be a while.
Phoebe Buffay,You're on!
Phoebe Buffay,One hundred thousand dollars!
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
Phoebe Buffay,No one's here! Oh damnit!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you're still pregnant. Oh, I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y'know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?"
Phoebe Buffay,Fine! You're on!
Phoebe Buffay,"Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there."
Phoebe Buffay,Good God man don't anger it.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh I-I don't know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Is Rachel having the baby?
Phoebe Buffay,They're at the coffeehouse.
Phoebe Buffay,We know it's a girl!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you made it!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest."
Phoebe Buffay,Sure! What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is fun."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Why aren't you with Rachel?
Phoebe Buffay,But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Phoebe Buffay,Right. And with who again?
Phoebe Buffay,I know!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it ate your money?"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I'll see you downstairs then."
Phoebe Buffay,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
Phoebe Buffay,Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Phoebe Buffay,Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hands.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first."
Phoebe Buffay,"No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything."
Phoebe Buffay,"But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks."
Phoebe Buffay,What else? What else?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Ah-uh.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Enter Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?"
Phoebe Buffay,Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'll get it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Relax, it's not like we're forking."
Phoebe Buffay,Y'know what? This one is.
Phoebe Buffay,"Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet."
Phoebe Buffay,"Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now."
Phoebe Buffay,"You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot."
Phoebe Buffay,Can we come in?
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, she's so beautiful."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't."
Phoebe Buffay,Ohhh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,Is she in there?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it."
Phoebe Buffay,Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh and I need to talk to you.
Phoebe Buffay,To see if know what these guys are talking about.
Phoebe Buffay,"Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Are you all right?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! He did it?
Phoebe Buffay,Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Phoebe Buffay,"I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people."
Phoebe Buffay,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so."
Phoebe Buffay,Especially Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,"There he goes, your fiance."
Phoebe Buffay,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey! Wait up!
Phoebe Buffay,Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, me too. Should we wake her up?"
Phoebe Buffay,And so engaged.
Phoebe Buffay,Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,So whose ring is it?
Phoebe Buffay,Is it an engagement ring?
Phoebe Buffay,But you didn't give it to her?
Phoebe Buffay,But you were going to propose?
Phoebe Buffay,"Huh, I might be losing interest in this."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment."
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her."
Phoebe Buffay,"No they ran out of ""It's a girl"" but I can fix this one, See?"
Phoebe Buffay,Look at all the stuff people sent!
Phoebe Buffay,She's just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
Phoebe Buffay,Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
Phoebe Buffay,"I dunno, well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing really quickly."
Phoebe Buffay,You know that's... that's her.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby."
Phoebe Buffay,I can say I told you so but she's kinda doing that for me.
Phoebe Buffay,It really does... how long do you think we have to stay?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright you guys, we can't turn on each other, Okay? That's just what she wants."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh I'm kinda part of this.
Phoebe Buffay,I knew I should have married Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I'm just gonna go. No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, I'll try, fine! Yes, Okay!"
Phoebe Buffay,Shh! Nothing works with this child!
Phoebe Buffay,I have to go scream into a pillow.
Phoebe Buffay,Have I gone deaf?
Phoebe Buffay,You must be a fireball in bed.
Phoebe Buffay,I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again! I'm kidding.
Phoebe Buffay,Thankfully you don't need me at all so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let's give it six to eight months .
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,I call their apartment!!!
Phoebe Buffay,It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Phoebe Buffay,Look at you all grown up.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Done. Oh good, really?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,So how is this for our big double date tonight?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for."
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, give me something. What's his name?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours."
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so..."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you."
Phoebe Buffay,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Do you not know each other?
Phoebe Buffay,"Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?"
Phoebe Buffay,"You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose."
Phoebe Buffay,Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm out of here.
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,Why did you go along with that?
Phoebe Buffay,"That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?"
Phoebe Buffay,Prove it.
Phoebe Buffay,That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Phoebe Buffay,You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Phoebe Buffay,Uhuh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out."

Phoebe Buffay,Bye Chandler.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!"

Phoebe Buffay,"oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market."
Phoebe Buffay,yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Phoebe Buffay,"I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy well what about ok well there's gotta be someone."

Phoebe Buffay,"I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him."
Phoebe Buffay,yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,ok.
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh huh yeah there's just something umm, there's something you should know Vicrum just called."
Phoebe Buffay,".and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel."
Phoebe Buffay,yeah well yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Phoebe Buffay,I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,ok I can't do this.
Phoebe Buffay,"well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so. if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward You kissed me."
Phoebe Buffay,so you don't think I'm a total freak.
Phoebe Buffay,"I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers."
Phoebe Buffay,"you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh hey you guys, I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead."
Phoebe Buffay,So?
Phoebe Buffay,"No! It's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it's a little to soon to show my true colors."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Rachel!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yay!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven't been together the six of us in such a long time."

Phoebe Buffay,I'm gonna go.
Phoebe Buffay,Where is everyone? They're forty minutes late.
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing."
Phoebe Buffay,"Joseph! Thou needn't worry, they shan't be long."
Phoebe Buffay,One really does have a stick up one's ass. Doesn't one?
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?"
Phoebe Buffay,Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Phoebe Buffay,"Both it is, thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Phoebe Buffay,And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Phoebe Buffay,Wher-where have you been?
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order."
Phoebe Buffay,Aw ... what?
Phoebe Buffay,'s a good toast.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now."
Phoebe Buffay,"well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, that was Mike."
Phoebe Buffay,"Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna take off."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t-not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye."
Phoebe Buffay,I know!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe not, is it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, I want to."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go."
Phoebe Buffay,It really is.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! David!
Phoebe Buffay,"No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Who cares, it got you here."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow. Where is your luggage?
Phoebe Buffay,"A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good."
Phoebe Buffay,No...
Phoebe Buffay,I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Phoebe Buffay,He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible."
Phoebe Buffay,Really? Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night."
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am."
Phoebe Buffay,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny..."
Phoebe Buffay,Oof...
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, wait, wait!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I should have told you."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,I am happy.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do."
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate..."
Phoebe Buffay,I mean...
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no. No."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him..."
Phoebe Buffay,And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, yeah..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well... guys?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand."
Phoebe Buffay,Right! Never! Never! I swear!
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!
Phoebe Buffay,Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Phoebe Buffay,They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say ""neither""."
Phoebe Buffay,So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
Phoebe Buffay,That's she's like the daughter she never had. Listen!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm wearing pantyhose!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!"
Phoebe Buffay,Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Phoebe Buffay,And you... Your home is lovely.
Phoebe Buffay,Holy crap!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, try and stop me!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
Phoebe Buffay,Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?"
Phoebe Buffay,God! God! This is not going well.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?"
Phoebe Buffay,So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah I bet! Look out!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, are you okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so sorry!
Phoebe Buffay,"I really, really am sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave..."
Phoebe Buffay,"...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Pervert Parade?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God! Is that veal?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... Hmmm... yummy Hmmm..."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah... The woman you what?
Phoebe Buffay,I love you too...
Phoebe Buffay,YEAH...! How great is this...?
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And Here's Something Rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, what's going on Joe?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, what.. what was the work thing?"
Phoebe Buffay,"""Pick up grandma at the airport""?"
Phoebe Buffay,Phoe-Be.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying."
Phoebe Buffay,You are a terrific actor.
Phoebe Buffay,Thats a great movie.
Phoebe Buffay,PHOE-BE.
Phoebe Buffay,There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.
Phoebe Buffay,It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, what happened? Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's raccoon."
Phoebe Buffay,No! Nothing with a raccoon.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Phoebe Buffay,It's all right. You can mourn.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Broke them all, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,You gonna tell her?
Phoebe Buffay,No problem! Next week: stealing...
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! I love things. What happened?
Phoebe Buffay,Eye-contact?
Phoebe Buffay,I hope you were using protection.
Phoebe Buffay,Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes.
Phoebe Buffay,So? What if they do?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye-contact."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, you're giving your real number."
Phoebe Buffay,"Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?"
Phoebe Buffay,What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation."
Phoebe Buffay,"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough."
Phoebe Buffay,Better!
Phoebe Buffay,Really? You're moving on from Ross?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message."
Phoebe Buffay,"""Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone."" Dead on."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom.
Phoebe Buffay,"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"""
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I like my job."
Phoebe Buffay,"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. ""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along. Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"" Happy holidays, everybody!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, we do it every year!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, we have to!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well then, you should look with us."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, who's it for?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
Phoebe Buffay,You guuuyys.
Phoebe Buffay,Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Blah blargah, blar-blab."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!"
Phoebe Buffay,Aren't we done with that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
Phoebe Buffay,Now give me my real gift.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,You could do that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, really?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, now. What?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, that helps."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. So, what did he say?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor."
Phoebe Buffay,Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,Who dies?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, doctor."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, from the top, people!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
Phoebe Buffay,Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Phoebe Buffay,About what?
Phoebe Buffay,And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back."
Phoebe Buffay,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!"
Phoebe Buffay,What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, whew, no, that's Bob."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies."
Phoebe Buffay,What are those?
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
Phoebe Buffay,"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Mikey.
Phoebe Buffay,What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay,To kill Bob??
Phoebe Buffay,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
Phoebe Buffay,Suzie?
Phoebe Buffay,"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother."
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now."
Phoebe Buffay,Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Phoebe Buffay,"No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites."
Phoebe Buffay,You must think I'm crazy.
Phoebe Buffay,"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, I think I've left something here."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, maybe that's him!"
Phoebe Buffay,Well it depends.
Phoebe Buffay,On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Phoebe Buffay,Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! Talking about high maintenance.
Phoebe Buffay,I'm a woman!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?"
Phoebe Buffay,"But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Phoebe Buffay,OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
Phoebe Buffay,While drinking...
Phoebe Buffay,Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god.
Phoebe Buffay,"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"""No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" Thank you!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Phoebe Buffay,But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
Phoebe Buffay,All the time when you're cooking.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah you're always singing ""Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"""
Phoebe Buffay,OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Phoebe Buffay,"Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway."
Phoebe Buffay,Can you totally see through her shirt ?
Phoebe Buffay,Every little bit of you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but..."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, she gives the people what they want."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,What you got?
Phoebe Buffay,"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
Phoebe Buffay,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Phoebe Buffay,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh."""
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,A teacher?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,How do you even know a woman like that?
Phoebe Buffay,Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,So now what do we do?
Phoebe Buffay,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's..."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I think we killed it."
Phoebe Buffay,Hello?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Rach!"
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned."
Phoebe Buffay,Did he go out for a cigarette?
Phoebe Buffay,"My dear, sweet Rach."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone."
Phoebe Buffay,"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan."
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
Phoebe Buffay,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mexico! End credits.
Phoebe Buffay,What's your news?
Phoebe Buffay,"Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!"
Phoebe Buffay,That's great.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I hear divorce bells."
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Lowell, is that you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god!
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!"
Phoebe Buffay,Good for you!
Phoebe Buffay,Ouh...
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer."
Phoebe Buffay,She was a drug dealer!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,You were?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god.
Phoebe Buffay,"No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I think we have a problem here."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-"
Phoebe Buffay,I know... I mugged Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, how was class?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing, I really wanna know."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid."
Phoebe Buffay,"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, it was."
Phoebe Buffay,"""Gimme your money, punk!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say."
Phoebe Buffay,Really? Even more humiliating than.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?"
Phoebe Buffay,I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"""
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here."
Phoebe Buffay,"You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him."
Phoebe Buffay,Why??
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you."
Phoebe Buffay,I want you to stay.
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Phoebe Buffay,I'll miss you.
Phoebe Buffay,Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell yeah!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's gonna be fun!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news."
Phoebe Buffay,I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well you put down the toilet seat."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do."
Phoebe Buffay,I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! You bet roomy!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns."
Phoebe Buffay,China patterns!!!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
Phoebe Buffay,What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Wow.
Phoebe Buffay,Was it really that bad?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean."
Phoebe Buffay,But it's just...
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah I get that.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage."
Phoebe Buffay,No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Phoebe Buffay,Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Phoebe Buffay,Never.
Phoebe Buffay,"I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!"
Phoebe Buffay,That's not how you really feel is it?
Phoebe Buffay,Seriously? You divorce-o?
Phoebe Buffay,It's ok that's how you feel.
Phoebe Buffay,I do love Mike.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,It's not cooler.
Phoebe Buffay,Better.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you."
Phoebe Buffay,What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay,They are awfully boxy...
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
Phoebe Buffay,Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Phoebe Buffay,Someday.
Phoebe Buffay,I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
Phoebe Buffay,"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you."
Phoebe Buffay,"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen."
Phoebe Buffay,Are you gonna change yours?
Phoebe Buffay,Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't want it to end either.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said."
Phoebe Buffay,That was a test and you just failed.
Phoebe Buffay,"God, I wish Mike were here."
Phoebe Buffay,"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that."
Phoebe Buffay,Here.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time."
Phoebe Buffay,You can't have it.
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building."
Phoebe Buffay,Those are my shoes.
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
Phoebe Buffay,I ordered Chinese food.
Phoebe Buffay,What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him."
Phoebe Buffay,There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Phoebe Buffay,Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Phoebe Buffay,Sit down.
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks, you look good too."
Phoebe Buffay,So how's the piano playing going?
Phoebe Buffay,I've missed you too.
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I missed you so much!"
Phoebe Buffay,Who is this?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey will you get me tickets too?
Phoebe Buffay,You don't wanna win the lottery?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!"
Phoebe Buffay,I hope I win!
Phoebe Buffay,"One, two, three!"
Phoebe Buffay,Get a room!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh, I like that, ""daddy"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together."
Phoebe Buffay,OOOOOHHHHH!
Phoebe Buffay,"OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!"
Phoebe Buffay,"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! ."
Phoebe Buffay,Don't come any closer!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, what's more important, your friends or money?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl."
Phoebe Buffay,"What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?"
Phoebe Buffay,"As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do."
Phoebe Buffay,"Guys, the drawing is about to start!"
Phoebe Buffay,I'm still looking through mine...
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, what was the Powerball number again?"
Phoebe Buffay,We won.
Phoebe Buffay,We won!
Phoebe Buffay,Don't tear it.
Phoebe Buffay,"I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!"
Phoebe Buffay,It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Phoebe Buffay,I beg to differ .
Phoebe Buffay,"Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Sure!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips! Chandler: Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!"
Phoebe Buffay,And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Phoebe Buffay,"And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ole!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,But what?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, say no more."
Phoebe Buffay,": It wasn't just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! Classy, uh?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man."
Phoebe Buffay,"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work..."
Phoebe Buffay,My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Phoebe Buffay,Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it""!"
Phoebe Buffay,Well...it's not about quality.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What are people having, the garlic Martini?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall."
Phoebe Buffay,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
Phoebe Buffay,Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Phoebe Buffay,Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? ."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry too...
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Phoebe: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
Phoebe Buffay,What is it?
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah, ah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Phoebe Buffay,And that horrible museum tour!
Phoebe Buffay,We know about your party Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, What's the matter?"
Phoebe Buffay,Worse?
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd."
Phoebe Buffay,"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny..."
Phoebe Buffay,Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Phoebe Buffay,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
Phoebe Buffay,I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh... then I overpaid.
Phoebe Buffay,"What's up? Hey, Rachel!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, do you care about friendship?"
Phoebe Buffay,"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend."
Phoebe Buffay,Promise?
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?"
Phoebe Buffay,But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
Phoebe Buffay,'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, are they listening?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello ""ja"", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, then I'm Swedish..."
Phoebe Buffay,It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Phoebe Buffay,Ja!
Phoebe Buffay,Time for your scalp massage!
Phoebe Buffay,Is something wrong?
Phoebe Buffay,Uhm... Stockholm.
Phoebe Buffay,"""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Ja! Ja!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?"
Phoebe Buffay,Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
Phoebe Buffay,You know it's me?
Phoebe Buffay,How can you come here?
Phoebe Buffay,I don't have to tell you everything!
Phoebe Buffay,Tips not included.
Phoebe Buffay,"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!"
Phoebe Buffay,You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you."
Phoebe Buffay,Good morning receptionist.
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!"
Phoebe Buffay,Exactly!
Phoebe Buffay,"I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, that'll be great!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'll take some of that."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ok!
Phoebe Buffay,"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?"
Phoebe Buffay,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Who else?
Phoebe Buffay,You like Joey?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Sure!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me."
Phoebe Buffay,I didn't say anything yet!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face."
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! We have a problem.
Phoebe Buffay,Good plan.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""!"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Phoebe Buffay,"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture."
Phoebe Buffay,"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room."
Phoebe Buffay,David?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
Phoebe Buffay,What happened?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Good!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, good for you."
Phoebe Buffay,Mike and I broke up.
Phoebe Buffay,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!"
Phoebe Buffay,Well... no.
Phoebe Buffay,I'd love to.
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me."
Phoebe Buffay,I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there."
Phoebe Buffay,Mike?? Who's Mike?
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!"
Phoebe Buffay,Not Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you leaving ""The Supremes""?"
Phoebe Buffay,Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike, do you take Phoebe..."" You know, it's every girl's dream!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, ok, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, Mike!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, Mike's here."
Phoebe Buffay,"What are you, what are you doing here?"
Phoebe Buffay,No!
Phoebe Buffay,"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future."
Phoebe Buffay,"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!"
Phoebe Buffay,... and...?
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!"
Phoebe Buffay,Nobody wins!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm out."
Phoebe Buffay,"Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!"
Phoebe Buffay,No idea! I though he was soft like you!
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, you call it."
Phoebe Buffay,Tails!
Phoebe Buffay,He was a lawyer!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?"
Phoebe Buffay,"C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!"
Phoebe Buffay,I sleep with him!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back."
Phoebe Buffay,Mike wins?
Phoebe Buffay,You can't do that!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister."
Phoebe Buffay,It's like watching porn!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want..."
Phoebe Buffay,Is that Ross?
Phoebe Buffay,Sounds like he's with someone.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend."
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Phoebe Buffay,Get over here!
Phoebe Buffay,We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Phoebe Buffay,"You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!"
Phoebe Buffay,That's the door. He's gone...
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa..."
Phoebe Buffay,Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, what is this?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, have you guys seen Monica?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright..."
Phoebe Buffay,Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin..."
Phoebe Buffay,Aaah... you're not good at this...
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,You have a... You have a date? With who?
Phoebe Buffay,You have... have a girlfriend?
Phoebe Buffay,For how long?
Phoebe Buffay,"Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, Mike's place."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, that was fast."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I."
Phoebe Buffay,Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout."
Phoebe Buffay,I... I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,Enchante.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I don't..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love."
Phoebe Buffay,"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend."
Phoebe Buffay,You're welcome!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey guys!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, what's all this stuff?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, how does it work?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Good to see you.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing.."
Phoebe Buffay,"That's a, that's a long time."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!"
Phoebe Buffay,What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?"
Phoebe Buffay,Insane.
Phoebe Buffay,"Alice would never go for it, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?"
Phoebe Buffay,Frank Jr.Jr.?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, so that leaves Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together."
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Still, he had to find out sometime."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? ""Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!"" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I know! ""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel"". All right, who hasn't?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ugh, Let's just cut her out!"
Phoebe Buffay,Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, don't hold thy breath!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, why, why didn't you just say no!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!"
Phoebe Buffay,I did!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you kidding, I love it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Musty!
Phoebe Buffay,Well...kinda.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, in America you're just an ""ass""."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Please, Monica? In the hall?"
Phoebe Buffay,"It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill."
Phoebe Buffay,You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Phoebe Buffay,"Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, it's a birthday party."
Phoebe Buffay,So you're gonna... hit on her?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Phoebe Buffay,Separate performances.
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . ""Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot."
Phoebe Buffay,oh! Now it's a party!
Phoebe Buffay,"And you know, I have a massage client soon."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it did not."
Phoebe Buffay,Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Phoebe Buffay,"Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, lets just draw straws."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!! Let's do that!
Phoebe Buffay,Ok! I want the dolphin!
Phoebe Buffay,I'm too excited!
Phoebe Buffay,Go! Go!
Phoebe Buffay,Good job Alan!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, see you later!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh good, I didn't miss the party."
Phoebe Buffay,"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you made it into a bunny."
Phoebe Buffay,"Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard! end."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary."
Phoebe Buffay,YEAH!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room."
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they're in my seat. It's my anniversary. Here we are! . Can't believe it's been a whole year!"
Phoebe Buffay,ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Phoebe Buffay,YOU'RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh how lame... oh, it's so tacky, and impersonal."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's the worst way to propose!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, mine was worse than that."
Phoebe Buffay,"We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, that's what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don't think he's ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, do you think I should propose?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, ok, so how should I do it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two like that?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I've got work and then I'm proposing.."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhuh, uhuh..."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm not. I'm praying. Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! Where... where are you going?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think you should wait."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients."
Phoebe Buffay,Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
Phoebe Buffay,That's not very enlightened!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, hey! Boo us? Boo you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls."
Phoebe Buffay,"I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's in the cake, isn't it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Wait! Oh wait! Oh no!
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh!
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!
Phoebe Buffay,I love you more!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey...
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... HUGE engagement ring!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever."
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you! Oh, and I have something for you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated."
Phoebe Buffay,"I would, but you're the last one."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, my first love!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Dead. Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yes, they are."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?"
Phoebe Buffay,A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, you don't like her?"
Phoebe Buffay,Really? You think?
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi! Sorry, I'm late."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Gladys say hello to your new home!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster."
Phoebe Buffay,Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis.
Phoebe Buffay,I knew it!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!"
Phoebe Buffay,So what did you two do about it?
Phoebe Buffay,"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?"
Phoebe Buffay,Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one."
Phoebe Buffay,And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Phoebe Buffay,Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe Buffay,Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mhm... it's moist.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello, is this the creepy residence?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity."
Phoebe Buffay,"We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress."
Phoebe Buffay,City Hall.
Phoebe Buffay,"It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'll just ask for it back!"
Phoebe Buffay,"It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting."
Phoebe Buffay,"Gay, go."
Phoebe Buffay,"The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do."
Phoebe Buffay,"I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to ""kill me"" or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from."
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted."
Phoebe Buffay,"And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time."
Phoebe Buffay,We're back!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children."
Phoebe Buffay,"Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!"
Phoebe Buffay,But... but... but we're giving you this!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, this is very generous!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, is that you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break."
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch."
Phoebe Buffay,"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day."
Phoebe Buffay,You're not making the pies yourself?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Rach.
Phoebe Buffay,What's Emma doing today?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh... okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I was thinking..."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man."
Phoebe Buffay,"But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!"
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!"
Phoebe Buffay,Why not!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"No, we're late!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!"
Phoebe Buffay,And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, what are we gonna say?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!"
Phoebe Buffay,"We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? ."
Phoebe Buffay,It's locked.
Phoebe Buffay,What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, so sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,So bad.
Phoebe Buffay,"Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize . Here! ."
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving."
Phoebe Buffay,I'll pull you through.
Phoebe Buffay,I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Phoebe Buffay,"Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here."
Phoebe Buffay,I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, right! Your adoption interview!"
Phoebe Buffay,What are you gonna name the baby?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mandy.
Phoebe Buffay,No.
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine, I'll give you her number."
Phoebe Buffay,SARAH!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Phoebe Buffay,What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Phoebe Buffay,"That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank God you're here. Listen to this!
Phoebe Buffay,Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Phoebe Buffay,What? You know about the plate thing?
Phoebe Buffay,You wouldn't let her have a grape?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!"
Phoebe Buffay,This place is awesome!
Phoebe Buffay,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,What? They will be!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?"
Phoebe Buffay,"oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later."
Phoebe Buffay,"If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, how cute!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, she looks just like a little doll!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy! Look, there's Chandler."
Phoebe Buffay,OH! He's having an affair.
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, I'm always right about these things."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah? Well, let's see. Ok, duck down."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember""."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm..."
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye."
Phoebe Buffay,Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Phoebe Buffay,I got them!
Phoebe Buffay,"So, should we tell her?"
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Who'd you seen him with?
Phoebe Buffay,TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. . He is a good guy. You're right, he wouldn't cheat."
Phoebe Buffay,WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you."
Phoebe Buffay,They went in together. So sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Why do you have a realtor?
Phoebe Buffay,So you're gonna move?
Phoebe Buffay,"Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but so is this."
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
Phoebe Buffay,Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Phoebe Buffay,What else?
Phoebe Buffay,That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters."
Phoebe Buffay,You're gonna be okay?
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
Phoebe Buffay,Great!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing."
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you so much for this.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?"
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?"
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, God!"
Phoebe Buffay,Rachel?
Phoebe Buffay,Are you kidding?
Phoebe Buffay,How old is your phonebook?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!"
Phoebe Buffay,This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Phoebe Buffay,Shocking!
Phoebe Buffay,"Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!"
Phoebe Buffay,I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?"
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, it's fine. We'll pay you."
Phoebe Buffay,"Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch."
Phoebe Buffay,"There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?"
Phoebe Buffay,Finish it!
Phoebe Buffay,Your last dance. Do it for us.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no, no, don't stop!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom..."
Phoebe Buffay,So... what do you say?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I don't care, so you pick!"
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and..."
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Phoebe Buffay,What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Phoebe Buffay,She did? Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?"
Phoebe Buffay,Rehearse it!
Phoebe Buffay,So Rach.
Phoebe Buffay,Where is Emma?
Phoebe Buffay,What's up?
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut."
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Phoebe Buffay,I don't have a fax machine.
Phoebe Buffay,I decided to pee.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here..."
Phoebe Buffay,"And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done."
Phoebe Buffay,YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, happy my wedding day to you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, this is a lot!"
Phoebe Buffay,You won awards?
Phoebe Buffay,Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?"
Phoebe Buffay,Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Phoebe Buffay,"No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?"
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, what's it doing here?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?"
Phoebe Buffay,Help me.
Phoebe Buffay,I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
Phoebe Buffay,Please?
Phoebe Buffay,More than I wanna get married.
Phoebe Buffay,About what?
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,What do you think?
Phoebe Buffay,"Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay. Hi new dad."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,I love you guys.
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait, oh no. Wait."
Phoebe Buffay,I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,Na-ah.
Phoebe Buffay,"When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait, oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes."
Phoebe Buffay,I do.
Phoebe Buffay,"I got married! Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing."
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, why? What's up?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Oui, bien sur je parle Francais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is ""My name is Claude"", so, just repeat after me. ""Je m'appelle Claude""."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, just... let's try it again."
Phoebe Buffay,Je m'appelle Claude.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
Phoebe Buffay,"It does, really?"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, let just try it again. Really listen."
Phoebe Buffay,Je m'appelle Claude.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, mon Dieu!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Phoebe Buffay,Je m'appelle Claude.
Phoebe Buffay,"Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. ""je""."
Phoebe Buffay,m'ap.
Phoebe Buffay,pelle.
Phoebe Buffay,"Great, ok faster! ""je"""
Phoebe Buffay,m'ap.
Phoebe Buffay,pelle.
Phoebe Buffay,Je m'appelle!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!"
Phoebe Buffay,"I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Joey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again."
Phoebe Buffay,"Really, can I hear some of it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!"
Phoebe Buffay,How could you possibly think that?
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Regine Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estee Lauder."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ecoutez, je vais vous dire la verite. C'est mon petit frere. Il est un peu retarde."
Phoebe Buffay,"Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui..."
Phoebe Buffay,Merci. Au revoir.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, can you really tapdance?"
Phoebe Buffay,It's off the resume.
Phoebe Buffay,Archery?
Phoebe Buffay,Horseback riding?
Phoebe Buffay,You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Phoebe Buffay,Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Phoebe Buffay,Ready... GO!
Phoebe Buffay,You did it!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night."
Phoebe Buffay,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,"I do, he's been working on that all day!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Phoebe Buffay,Where did you go to do it?
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan."
Phoebe Buffay,"What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Good for you. That was really mature.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just..."
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here."
Phoebe Buffay,This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
Phoebe Buffay,"I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun."
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, not anything, I mean..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this could take a while."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, not anymore. I changed it today."
Phoebe Buffay,"Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock."
Phoebe Buffay,Uh! Princess Consuela.
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh!
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie."
Phoebe Buffay,"What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?"
Phoebe Buffay,Ross...
Phoebe Buffay,Can you?
Phoebe Buffay,And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God!
Phoebe Buffay,Welcome back!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, me too!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay."
Phoebe Buffay,Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
Phoebe Buffay,Nope.
Phoebe Buffay,Yep.
Phoebe Buffay,"Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it."
Phoebe Buffay,"Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mike Crap Bag?
Phoebe Buffay,"You're not serious, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it."
Phoebe Buffay,And I love Crap.
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you, mister Bag."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh hi Rita! Good! Oh, Rita's a massage client."
Phoebe Buffay,"Er, Rita, this is my husband."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?"
Phoebe Buffay,How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Phoebe Buffay,It's a funny word.
Phoebe Buffay,...Oh crap!
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, what's going on?"
Phoebe Buffay,Good for you!
Phoebe Buffay,Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey...
Phoebe Buffay,You okay with this?
Phoebe Buffay,Talking to Ross.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?"
Phoebe Buffay,She died.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, she was just an agent."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. Everything ok?
Phoebe Buffay,Estelle? Why?
Phoebe Buffay,I'm guessing she does.
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her."
Phoebe Buffay,Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, it's Estelle."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie."
Phoebe Buffay,I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?"
Phoebe Buffay,What are you saying?
Phoebe Buffay,"Man, tough week for Estelle!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might."
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you."
Phoebe Buffay,Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, it's Estelle."
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by..."
Phoebe Buffay,"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig."
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party."
Phoebe Buffay,You doing ok?
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-hmm.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!"
Phoebe Buffay,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you."
Phoebe Buffay,"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!"
Phoebe Buffay,I love you too. Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch!
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you're so screwed."
Phoebe Buffay,She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying."
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice."
Phoebe Buffay,Where do you think Mike really is?
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well."
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her."
Phoebe Buffay,Tell me about it.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, I think I'm gonna head out."
Phoebe Buffay,"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here."
Phoebe Buffay,How was your night?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you got to get to the hospital."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, ready?"
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, here it goes..."
Phoebe Buffay,Morning.
Phoebe Buffay,What's that?
Phoebe Buffay,It's a baby chick and duck!
Phoebe Buffay,I did not see that coming.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,"That is the rule, though."
Phoebe Buffay,Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl."
Phoebe Buffay,Have you seen him throw a ball?
Phoebe Buffay,What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Phoebe Buffay,But do you wanna get back together?
Phoebe Buffay,YAY!
Phoebe Buffay,Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! ""Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."""
Phoebe Buffay,Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Phoebe Buffay,"Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go."
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. ""Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."""
Phoebe Buffay,Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom."
Phoebe Buffay,Unbelievable!
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, what are you working on?"
Phoebe Buffay,"How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?"
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?"
Phoebe Buffay,What?
Phoebe Buffay,"How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, Joe?"
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!"
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! What do you have there?
Phoebe Buffay,"Honey, that's gorgeous!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard."
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? ""Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"""
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat."
Phoebe Buffay,One? How about a whole bunch?
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull."
Phoebe Buffay,"So, you just let her go?"
Phoebe Buffay,But now she'll never know how he feels!
Phoebe Buffay,Woo!
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!"
Phoebe Buffay,"You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport."
Phoebe Buffay,Hurry!
Phoebe Buffay,"That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car."
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,I - I don't take passengers.
Phoebe Buffay,"My medallion number is, ""Get out of the cab!"""
Phoebe Buffay,Get out of the cab!
Phoebe Buffay,You can open your eyes now.
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, she jumped right back up."
Phoebe Buffay,Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Phoebe Buffay,You should have thought of that before you got in!
Phoebe Buffay,Toll-booth.
Phoebe Buffay,Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Phoebe Buffay,Hurry!
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,"Damn, that window is clean."
Phoebe Buffay,"Ross, where are you going?"
Phoebe Buffay,What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Phoebe Buffay,You have to get a ticket to get past security.
Phoebe Buffay,"Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!"
Phoebe Buffay,"Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?"
Phoebe Buffay,We're on our honeymoon.
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so lucky I married you.
Phoebe Buffay,"No, did we miss it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, it's me. Here's Ross."
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I've never gone this fast before."
Phoebe Buffay,"She's got her cell, you could call her."
Phoebe Buffay,You don't have any other choice!
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?"
Phoebe Buffay,"For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, Rach, hang on."
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane."
Phoebe Buffay,I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
Phoebe Buffay,I don't see her.
Phoebe Buffay,There she is!
Phoebe Buffay,RACHEL!!
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, you're on."
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry.
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway."
Phoebe Buffay,He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?"
Phoebe Buffay,"So, I guess this is it."
