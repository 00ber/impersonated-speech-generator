speaker,transcript
Monica Geller,There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Monica Geller,"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
Monica Geller,And they weren't looking at you before?!
Monica Geller,"Are you okay, sweetie?"
Monica Geller,Carol moved her stuff out today.
Monica Geller,Let me get you some coffee.
Monica Geller,No you don't.
Monica Geller,"Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., ""I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren."" was what? A wrong number?"
Monica Geller,Rachel?!
Monica Geller,"De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
Monica Geller,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?"
Monica Geller,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Monica Geller,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it."
Monica Geller,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
Monica Geller,"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things..."
Monica Geller,"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing."
Monica Geller,"Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!"
Monica Geller,"Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!"
Monica Geller,Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,"Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
Monica Geller,"Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?"
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
Monica Geller,"Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah..."
Monica Geller,"Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds."
Monica Geller,"Shut up, Joey!"
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
Monica Geller,-leg?
Monica Geller,"You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
Monica Geller,That's right.
Monica Geller,"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?"
Monica Geller,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
Monica Geller,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Monica Geller,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Monica Geller,"...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
Monica Geller,"Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here."
Monica Geller,Stop!
Monica Geller,We'll talk later.
Monica Geller,"Shut up, and put my table back."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff."
Monica Geller,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park."
Monica Geller,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Monica Geller,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?"
Monica Geller,"Well, it's like that. With feelings."
Monica Geller,Big time!
Monica Geller,"I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
Monica Geller,What for?
Monica Geller,"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?"
Monica Geller,How do you do that?
Monica Geller,You know Paul?
Monica Geller,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Monica Geller,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?"
Monica Geller,I hate men! I hate men!
Monica Geller,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Monica Geller,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?"
Monica Geller,How'd you pay for them?
Monica Geller,And who pays for that?
Monica Geller,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life."
Monica Geller,"All right, you ready?"
Monica Geller,"You can, I know you can!"
Monica Geller,Rachel! That was a library card!
Monica Geller,Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Monica Geller,"Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?"
Monica Geller,You be okay?
Monica Geller,"That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody."
Monica Geller,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?"
Monica Geller,What? I-I said you had a-
Monica Geller,Would you stop?
Monica Geller,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt."
Monica Geller,"What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it."
Monica Geller,Absolutely.
Monica Geller,Are you through with that?
Monica Geller,Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Monica Geller,"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have."
Monica Geller,"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!"
Monica Geller,You didn't.
Monica Geller,I gave you one job!
Monica Geller,I just... can't do it.
Monica Geller,Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Monica Geller,W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Monica Geller,What does she mean by 'involved'?
Monica Geller,Curry.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?"
Monica Geller,"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant."
Monica Geller,"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?"
Monica Geller,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me."
Monica Geller,What's that supposed to mean?
Monica Geller,No it's not.
Monica Geller,"So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?"
Monica Geller,"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this."
Monica Geller,Mm-hmm.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Am not!
Monica Geller,Oh shut up!
Monica Geller,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'."
Monica Geller,"Uh, Ross."
Monica Geller,"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger."
Monica Geller,What did they do to you?
Monica Geller,We're with you. We got it.
Monica Geller,Hey. Whaddya doing?
Monica Geller,"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date."
Monica Geller,"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun."
Monica Geller,"Let's see, today's Monday... Never."
Monica Geller,No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Monica Geller,"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out."
Monica Geller,Nope. Schhorry.
Monica Geller,"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
Monica Geller,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
Monica Geller,Do you all promise?
Monica Geller,Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Monica Geller,Hey. It's him. Who is it?
Monica Geller,"Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me."
Monica Geller,"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan."
Monica Geller,"Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?"
Monica Geller,C'mon!
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Monica Geller,Really!
Monica Geller,Hi.. how was the game?
Monica Geller,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Monica Geller,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Monica Geller,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, why is it unfair?"
Monica Geller,Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Monica Geller,"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like."
Monica Geller,"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing."
Monica Geller,I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Monica Geller,"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about."
Monica Geller,Hey. Where's Joey?
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Monica Geller,Okay..
Monica Geller,"Please, guys, we have to talk."
Monica Geller,"Alright, we have to talk."
Monica Geller,"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan."
Monica Geller,"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change."
Monica Geller,"Look, I- I could go on pretending-"
Monica Geller,"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!"
Monica Geller,I'm sorry..
Monica Geller,I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Monica Geller,Are you guys gonna be okay?
Monica Geller,I understand.
Monica Geller,"I'm, I'm really sorry."
Monica Geller,Relieved?
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Oh, y'know.."
Monica Geller,He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Monica Geller,Alright. Phoebe?
Monica Geller,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
Monica Geller,..Excuse me?
Monica Geller,How does she do that?
Monica Geller,Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Monica Geller,What's going on with you?
Monica Geller,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember."
Monica Geller,"Wow, you worked in a mine?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, yeah."
Monica Geller,I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?"
Monica Geller,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
Monica Geller,"We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister..."
Monica Geller,"Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people."
Monica Geller,"Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
Monica Geller,"That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay."
Monica Geller,"Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
Monica Geller,You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Monica Geller,"Ah, the other Jack."
Monica Geller,"So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy."
Monica Geller,...Pheebs?
Monica Geller,"No, you were right. I don't have a plan."
Monica Geller,Phoebe?
Monica Geller,Do you have a plan?
Monica Geller,Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Monica Geller,"Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?"
Monica Geller,Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Monica Geller,Oh God.
Monica Geller,Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Monica Geller,I see pizza!
Monica Geller,"White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?"
Monica Geller,Please tell me it's his mother.
Monica Geller,"Oh, no..."
Monica Geller,Light still out?
Monica Geller,Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Monica Geller,Shut up!
Monica Geller,I think he's shy.
Monica Geller,Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Monica Geller,"Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?"
Monica Geller,"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
Monica Geller,What?! You slept with Jason?
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's nice!"
Monica Geller,Excuse me?!
Monica Geller,"Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
Monica Geller,Where?
Monica Geller,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
Monica Geller,"Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo."
Monica Geller,Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
Monica Geller,"Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?"
Monica Geller,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
Monica Geller,Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Monica Geller,"Oh, god help us."
Monica Geller,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Monica Geller,What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Monica Geller,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Monica Geller,Which?
Monica Geller,"You've never met Bob, have you?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
Monica Geller,...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Monica Geller,"He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?"
Monica Geller,"How, how did that happen?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
Monica Geller,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
Monica Geller,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Monica Geller,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
Monica Geller,Oh my god.
Monica Geller,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Monica Geller,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Monica Geller,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Monica Geller,Oh!
Monica Geller,I'm outta here.
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?"
Monica Geller,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
Monica Geller,You could do that!
Monica Geller,"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
Monica Geller,Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Monica Geller,"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?"
Monica Geller,What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Monica Geller,"Good for you, Joey."
Monica Geller,"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"
Monica Geller,...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Monica Geller,How-how did that happen?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
Monica Geller,"You guys, I am not that bad!"
Monica Geller,That is so unfair!
Monica Geller,"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,I could do that.
Monica Geller,Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Monica Geller,STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica Geller,"Well, what's the part?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God.
Monica Geller,"Alright, alright, alright..."
Monica Geller,For what?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
Monica Geller,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Monica Geller,I warned you...
Monica Geller,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
Monica Geller,"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that."
Monica Geller,"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?"
Monica Geller,Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys."
Monica Geller,Uh-huh!
Monica Geller,"Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever."
Monica Geller,"If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!"
Monica Geller,"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on."
Monica Geller,"Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK."
Monica Geller,Hello?
Monica Geller,It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,I have no idea what you just said.
Monica Geller,"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Monica Geller,You did not go!
Monica Geller,Outside.
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,And that would be?
Monica Geller,"Joey, what's going on?"
Monica Geller,About what?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! I love him!
Monica Geller,My surprise party!
Monica Geller,Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Monica Geller,"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
Monica Geller,This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"If you want, I'll do it."
Monica Geller,I did.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
Monica Geller,"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
Monica Geller,"Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
Monica Geller,"How-how are you, Mom?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Nothing.
Monica Geller,"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
Monica Geller,Oh God!
Monica Geller,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,"G'bye, Nana."
Monica Geller,Ross!
Monica Geller,We checked. A lot.
Monica Geller,Dad!
Monica Geller,You what?
Monica Geller,Define fun.
Monica Geller,"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
Monica Geller,That's probably what they'll say.
Monica Geller,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Monica Geller,Are these the shoes?
Monica Geller,It was a really beautiful service.
Monica Geller,"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
Monica Geller,"Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
Monica Geller,That sounds like Nana.
Monica Geller,...I can imagine.
Monica Geller,"That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
Monica Geller,"How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example."
Monica Geller,Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Monica Geller,Huh.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I think so."
Monica Geller,Thank you. They're yours.
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
Monica Geller,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
Monica Geller,"Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?"
Monica Geller,"Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them."
Monica Geller,I am not wrong.
Monica Geller,"No, I just talked to them."
Monica Geller,"Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?"
Monica Geller,"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's."
Monica Geller,"You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
Monica Geller,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
Monica Geller,"So you're free Thursday, then."
Monica Geller,"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
Monica Geller,"Rach, here's your mail."
Monica Geller,"No, here's your mail."
Monica Geller,Would you just open it?
Monica Geller,We all chipped in.
Monica Geller,You owe me 20 bucks.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
Monica Geller,"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What?"
Monica Geller,"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping."
Monica Geller,That's not a question.
Monica Geller,"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots."
Monica Geller,Ah!
Monica Geller,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
Monica Geller,Why would we do that?
Monica Geller,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
Monica Geller,Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Monica Geller,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?"
Monica Geller,No I don't.
Monica Geller,"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
Monica Geller,The oven is on.
Monica Geller,"Well then get it, get it!"
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,Can you go any faster with that?
Monica Geller,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Monica Geller,I swear you said you had the keys.
Monica Geller,Why would I have the keys?
Monica Geller,But I didn't.
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I..."
Monica Geller,"Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined."
Monica Geller,"No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
Monica Geller,"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?"
Monica Geller,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Monica Geller,"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
Monica Geller,Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Monica Geller,Make a wish?
Monica Geller,W-wait. What is that?
Monica Geller,"No, no, I don't."
Monica Geller,"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
Monica Geller,Why don't you just get a roommate?
Monica Geller,"So, how'd it go?"
Monica Geller,So what are you gonna be?
Monica Geller,I think it's romantic.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
Monica Geller,Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Monica Geller,Do you always have to bring him here?
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,What's the matter?
Monica Geller,Vividly.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,That thing is not coming in here.
Monica Geller,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Monica Geller,Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Monica Geller,"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
Monica Geller,Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Monica Geller,Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Monica Geller,So I'm kissing everyone?
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
Monica Geller,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,We are not going to whistle.
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,Woo-woo!
Monica Geller,"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
Monica Geller,"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
Monica Geller,"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!"
Monica Geller,I wish all guys could be like him.
Monica Geller,He doesn't have anyone.
Monica Geller,Last night.
Monica Geller,"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
Monica Geller,Nah... not-not special enough.
Monica Geller,Waaay too special.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,What are you guys doing here?
Monica Geller,...What did I ask?
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,What are you doing here?
Monica Geller,I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Monica Geller,How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
Monica Geller,Hello.
Monica Geller,"No, you?"
Monica Geller,You just asked me.
Monica Geller,Oh! You're awake!
Monica Geller,You look good!
Monica Geller,"Oh, sorry."
Monica Geller,I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Monica Geller,I got you the foot massager.
Monica Geller,I read to you.
Monica Geller,"Oh, my pleasure."
Monica Geller,"""See you around?"""
Monica Geller,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?"""
Monica Geller,"This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe."
Monica Geller,What's a 'niffle'?
Monica Geller,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
Monica Geller,"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?"
Monica Geller,"So, did I hear Poconos?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, that's a big step."
Monica Geller,And Monica knows...
Monica Geller,"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, what is it?"
Monica Geller,"Well, what happened?"
Monica Geller,Are you sure?
Monica Geller,Was it...?
Monica Geller,Oh!
Monica Geller,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
Monica Geller,Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Monica Geller,We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Monica Geller,"Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!"
Monica Geller,"Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're right."
Monica Geller,"Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
Monica Geller,Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Monica Geller,"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
Monica Geller,"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone."
Monica Geller,"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, how long are you in the city?"
Monica Geller,Hello?
Monica Geller,C'mon up.
Monica Geller,"Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing."
Monica Geller,Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Monica Geller,"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
Monica Geller,You're welcome.
Monica Geller,Hate that guy!
Monica Geller,Hi...May I help you?
Monica Geller,Okay...who are you?
Monica Geller,"Oh, c'mon in."
Monica Geller,How's it going?
Monica Geller,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
Monica Geller,"So you talked to your dad, huh."
Monica Geller,How's it going?
Monica Geller,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Monica Geller,"Hello, Joey."
Monica Geller,You can not do this.
Monica Geller,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Monica Geller,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
Monica Geller,Which one was Pete Carney?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once."
Monica Geller,I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Monica Geller,"There's more beer, right?"
Monica Geller,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
Monica Geller,Burning's good.
Monica Geller,"Oh, Chandler, sorry."
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
Monica Geller,"Rach, come see who's out here!"
Monica Geller,I'll be right back.
Monica Geller,"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call."
Monica Geller,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
Monica Geller,Can we just start throwing things in?
Monica Geller,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
Monica Geller,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
Monica Geller,They're nice guys.
Monica Geller,"Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?"
Monica Geller,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
Monica Geller,Um... hi there.
Monica Geller,"Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
Monica Geller,"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
Monica Geller,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
Monica Geller,I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Monica Geller,"OK, try this salmon mousse."
Monica Geller,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well, is that better?"
Monica Geller,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
Monica Geller,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Monica Geller,"Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
Monica Geller,Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Monica Geller,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
Monica Geller,"Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
Monica Geller,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Monica Geller,Ten dollars an hour.
Monica Geller,Twelve dollars an hour.
Monica Geller,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour."
Monica Geller,Hi Steve!
Monica Geller,This is Rachel.
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger."
Monica Geller,I'm so glad you liked them!
Monica Geller,"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
Monica Geller,You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Monica Geller,"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
Monica Geller,"No, we don't."
Monica Geller,Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Monica Geller,Give them to me.
Monica Geller,"No, give me the..."
Monica Geller,That's it! Dinner is over!
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
Monica Geller,"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
Monica Geller,"Okay, look, this could be a really long game."
Monica Geller,"Ross, thats my jacket."
Monica Geller,"Ross, your little creatures got the remote again."
Monica Geller,Great.
Monica Geller,"Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot."
Monica Geller,I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
Monica Geller,"Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument."
Monica Geller,I'll get it.
Monica Geller,"Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles."
Monica Geller,"Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly."
Monica Geller,Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I think I get how to do this."
Monica Geller,"okay, Pheebs, theyre gone."
Monica Geller,Are you alright?
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Hon, you gotta talk to Joey."
Monica Geller,"Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?"
Monica Geller,Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Monica Geller,"Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something."
Monica Geller,"Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?"
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?"
Monica Geller,you don't have insurance?
Monica Geller,"I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
Monica Geller,Well there's not much we can do.
Monica Geller,"Hah, no no no no no no no no no no."
Monica Geller,That's insurance fraud.
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay. I hate this."
Monica Geller,"Hi, um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms ."
Monica Geller,"I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, I put mine."
Monica Geller,"yep, that's me, I am that stupid ."
Monica Geller,"Yes? ..yes, she is."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,"Uh, you left out the stupid part."
Monica Geller,"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates."
Monica Geller,"Come on, she'll be here any minute."
Monica Geller,Oh...
Monica Geller,"Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses."
Monica Geller,"Rachel, the cute doctors are here."
Monica Geller,"Hi, come on in."
Monica Geller,"Hi, Geoffrey."
Monica Geller,It's uh...
Monica Geller,"..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle."
Monica Geller,It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Monica Geller,"A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?"
Monica Geller,"I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby."
Monica Geller,"Sure, every time, you're such a princess..."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,What!?
Monica Geller,What!!?
Monica Geller,"Yeah... ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar."
Monica Geller,"Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!"
Monica Geller,I used to wet my bed.
Monica Geller,We both do that!
Monica Geller,"Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you..."
Monica Geller,"Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed."
Monica Geller,"Ross, he's got the remote again."
Monica Geller,"Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?"
Monica Geller,I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Monica Geller,"Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you."
Monica Geller,We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um..."
Monica Geller,I am. I'm that stupid.
Monica Geller,What's goin' on?
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank you."
Monica Geller,Michael.
Monica Geller,Monica.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Oh, look, he's waking up!"
Monica Geller,A quin pidio el pollo General Tso?
Monica Geller,"Mira, Ross, Marcel se llevo el control remoto."
Monica Geller,"Hey, guys."
Monica Geller,Lots of responses.
Monica Geller,: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No.
Monica Geller,"Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
Monica Geller,"I mean, that's a typical guy response."
Monica Geller,"So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
Monica Geller,"Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites."
Monica Geller,"Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks..."
Monica Geller,"Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
Monica Geller,"Hell no, we'll pay!"
Monica Geller,And you know what? We want a rematch.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Monica Geller,"That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand."
Monica Geller,You're kidding! Where? Where?
Monica Geller,"Oh, Rachel!"
Monica Geller,"Well, what's the job?"
Monica Geller,"OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. Hi!"
Monica Geller,I don't think so.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
Monica Geller,"OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
Monica Geller,"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?"
Monica Geller,"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
Monica Geller,"OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?"
Monica Geller,"Excuse me, where are you going?"
Monica Geller,"Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
Monica Geller,"Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante."
Monica Geller,Me too.
Monica Geller,I hate this game!
Monica Geller,"Sorry, Rach."
Monica Geller,"Alright, check."
Monica Geller,"Rachel, there's nothing in it."
Monica Geller,"OK, here you go. Good luck."
Monica Geller,Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Monica Geller,"That, you get? That, you get?"
Monica Geller,"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
Monica Geller,Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Monica Geller,What is it?
Monica Geller,Barry who you almost...?
Monica Geller,"And Mindy, your maid of...?"
Monica Geller,"That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Wonderful!
Monica Geller,There was nudity!
Monica Geller,Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Monica Geller,"Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?"
Monica Geller,Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Monica Geller,Which ones?
Monica Geller,He- he pooped in my shoe.
Monica Geller,Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Monica Geller,"Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
Monica Geller,"Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you."
Monica Geller,"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?"
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Monica Geller,"Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel."
Monica Geller,"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?"
Monica Geller,"Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
Monica Geller,The Luisa from home room!
Monica Geller,"No, none at all."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
Monica Geller,"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?"
Monica Geller,Marcel?
Monica Geller,Whaaat!
Monica Geller,What is it?
Monica Geller,"Look, Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,What're you gonna do?
Monica Geller,"Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?"
Monica Geller,Oh gosh.
Monica Geller,This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Monica Geller,That's because I'm in front of them.
Monica Geller,"Well, high school was not my favourite time."
Monica Geller,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Monica Geller,So have you called her yet?
Monica Geller,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Monica Geller,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
Monica Geller,How'd it go?
Monica Geller,"Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?"
Monica Geller,That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Monica Geller,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
Monica Geller,"Great, now he's waving back."
Monica Geller,What kinda stuff?
Monica Geller,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone."
Monica Geller,"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
Monica Geller,"Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?"
Monica Geller,Uh huh.
Monica Geller,"You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?"
Monica Geller,Brrrrrrr!
Monica Geller,"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
Monica Geller,Why don't you just take it with you?
Monica Geller,Why don't you just call her?
Monica Geller,Do you?
Monica Geller,Don't you have to pee?
Monica Geller,Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Monica Geller,So she's a woman! So what?
Monica Geller,Joey!!
Monica Geller,The green dress? Really?
Monica Geller,Nooo!
Monica Geller,You okay?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,Aww...
Monica Geller,"Yeah, there you go!"
Monica Geller,I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Monica Geller,I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Monica Geller,That's me.
Monica Geller,"Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
Monica Geller,This woman's living my life.
Monica Geller,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't."
Monica Geller,"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
Monica Geller,Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Monica Geller,"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother."
Monica Geller,"Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
Monica Geller,"Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class."
Monica Geller,"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
Monica Geller,What d'you think?
Monica Geller,"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
Monica Geller,"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm not getting this!"
Monica Geller,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Monica Geller,Great. It's gym class all over again.
Monica Geller,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Monica Geller,Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Monica Geller,Yeah. It's Dutch.
Monica Geller,"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit."
Monica Geller,It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Monica Geller,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Monica Geller,'Scuse me?
Monica Geller,"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Monica Geller,Yo- hooo!
Monica Geller,Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Monica Geller,Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Monica Geller,Water rules!
Monica Geller,Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Monica Geller,"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
Monica Geller,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Monica Geller,They've arrested Monica.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,How are you?
Monica Geller,Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Monica Geller,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
Monica Geller,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!"
Monica Geller,"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?"
Monica Geller,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
Monica Geller,Not necessarily...
Monica Geller,"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
Monica Geller,In.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
Monica Geller,Tell him.
Monica Geller,Just...please tell him.
Monica Geller,"Look at you, you won't even look at him."
Monica Geller,"Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'"
Monica Geller,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,He's... our age.
Monica Geller,"Okay, he's a senior in college."
Monica Geller,"No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I can't pass for 22?"
Monica Geller,I am 26.
Monica Geller,"Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Did not.
Monica Geller,How was that possible?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Unless...
Monica Geller,"Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so..."
Monica Geller,"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'"
Monica Geller,Ethan?
Monica Geller,Are you a virgin?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,You keep saying that.
Monica Geller,"Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
Monica Geller,No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Monica Geller,"Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months."
Monica Geller,"But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are."
Monica Geller,You're not a senior?
Monica Geller,Ok...ay.
Monica Geller,"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial."
Monica Geller,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
Monica Geller,"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
Monica Geller,Don't say it.
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,"No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out."
Monica Geller,"Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?"
Monica Geller,Aren't you gonna...
Monica Geller,That was gonna be my opener.
Monica Geller,It was.
Monica Geller,"Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
Monica Geller,"This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really..."
Monica Geller,...love you.
Monica Geller,"I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew."
Monica Geller,I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Monica Geller,"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
Monica Geller,What's with the guitar?
Monica Geller,I want a baby.
Monica Geller,Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Monica Geller,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Monica Geller,Oh yeah? When?
Monica Geller,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica Geller,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
Monica Geller,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Monica Geller,Well?
Monica Geller,Did you go home and change?
Monica Geller,"No, I haven't seen him."
Monica Geller,"Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet."
Monica Geller,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Can we come in?
Monica Geller,"Ross, can I?"
Monica Geller,"Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."
Monica Geller,He is so amazing.
Monica Geller,"Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time."
Monica Geller,"OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns..."
Monica Geller,Ewww!
Monica Geller,"Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
Monica Geller,Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Monica Geller,Man's got a point.
Monica Geller,Joey... we always know what you mean.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,You're going to China?
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
Monica Geller,"You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
Monica Geller,"OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
Monica Geller,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, just be there for her."
Monica Geller,Think about it.
Monica Geller,I can't believe he did this.
Monica Geller,"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
Monica Geller,"No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes."
Monica Geller,From here to the airport?
Monica Geller,"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
Monica Geller,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?"
Monica Geller,Sure.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!"
Monica Geller,Another good point.
Monica Geller,Why isn't it working out?
Monica Geller,Is he not cute enough for you?
Monica Geller,Does he not make enough money?
Monica Geller,Is there? Is there someone else?
Monica Geller,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Monica Geller,"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, from who?"
Monica Geller,"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, why?"
Monica Geller,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
Monica Geller,"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise."
Monica Geller,Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Monica Geller,"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!"
Monica Geller,"Guys, you got your hair cut."
Monica Geller,"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?"
Monica Geller,It's an expression.
Monica Geller,"Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
Monica Geller,"No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
Monica Geller,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,No you're not.
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
Monica Geller,"Please, just a little bit off the back."
Monica Geller,"Rachel, how did this happen?"
Monica Geller,"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
Monica Geller,"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake."
Monica Geller,"You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter."
Monica Geller,I promise.
Monica Geller,What? I didn't say anything.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
Monica Geller,How who wears it?
Monica Geller,Demi Moore is not a he.
Monica Geller,That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!"
Monica Geller,I know!
Monica Geller,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Monica Geller,Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Monica Geller,"Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist."
Monica Geller,"Ok, um, I'll go with you."
Monica Geller,"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
Monica Geller,But I'm...
Monica Geller,"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
Monica Geller,You're welcome.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
Monica Geller,"We were shopping, and we had lunch."
Monica Geller,You had a salad.
Monica Geller,"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye."
Monica Geller,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
Monica Geller,"Hey, where is everybody?"
Monica Geller,"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Monica Geller,That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Monica Geller,Judy.
Monica Geller,Julie.
Monica Geller,Jody!
Monica Geller,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
Monica Geller,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
Monica Geller,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!"
Monica Geller,That is not true!
Monica Geller,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Monica Geller,"Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve."
Monica Geller,I don't know what else to say.
Monica Geller,"I feel terrible, I really do."
Monica Geller,"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?"
Monica Geller,It's that terrible?
Monica Geller,"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
Monica Geller,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
Monica Geller,I'd do anything for you.
Monica Geller,So how was Joan?
Monica Geller,How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Monica Geller,"Hello, Mr. Heckles."
Monica Geller,We're not doing anything.
Monica Geller,"Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down."
Monica Geller,"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
Monica Geller,Mr. Heckles.
Monica Geller,That's terrible.
Monica Geller,What can we do for you?
Monica Geller,"Well, what about his family?"
Monica Geller,"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!"
Monica Geller,"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
Monica Geller,It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Monica Geller,You don't have any stuff.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Mmmmm.
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?"
Monica Geller,Hide the Lamp.
Monica Geller,Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Monica Geller,"Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, tell her!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're not gonna die alone."
Monica Geller,You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Monica Geller,You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different."
Monica Geller,"No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone."
Monica Geller,You made it!
Monica Geller,"No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment."
Monica Geller,That's fine.
Monica Geller,"Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell."
Monica Geller,"I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything."
Monica Geller,"Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?"
Monica Geller,"Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger."
Monica Geller,"Well, didn't you?"
Monica Geller,I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Monica Geller,What have I not told you?
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat."
Monica Geller,"Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple."
Monica Geller,That is wild.
Monica Geller,"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
Monica Geller,"I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
Monica Geller,"Hell, I wanna see Joey."
Monica Geller,"All I say is, she better get the job."
Monica Geller,"You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
Monica Geller,"Rachel, that's all we do."
Monica Geller,"Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine."
Monica Geller,Oh my god.
Monica Geller,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
Monica Geller,"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice."
Monica Geller,Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Monica Geller,Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Monica Geller,"Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, sorry."
Monica Geller,"Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns."
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank you!"
Monica Geller,"All right, what's goin' on?"
Monica Geller,Ok.
Monica Geller,"If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift."
Monica Geller,All of us.
Monica Geller,"I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look."
Monica Geller,"Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you."
Monica Geller,"It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat."
Monica Geller,Like?
Monica Geller,Charity?
Monica Geller,"Guys, we bought the tickets."
Monica Geller,"Well, I guess now we can't go."
Monica Geller,You know what? You're right.
Monica Geller,All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Monica Geller,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Monica Geller,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
Monica Geller,That was amazing!
Monica Geller,Do I know you?
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?"
Monica Geller,You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Monica Geller,"Uh, wait, backstage?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?"
Monica Geller,"Uh, good."
Monica Geller,"No, I just, I fell down."
Monica Geller,"You know, a party, or--"
Monica Geller,That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Monica Geller,It's work.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page."
Monica Geller,"Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired."
Monica Geller,"Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?"
Monica Geller,Maye it's me.
Monica Geller,There's my little boy.
Monica Geller,He hates me. My nephew hates me.
Monica Geller,What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
Monica Geller,That is so funny. Let me see that.
Monica Geller,"Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--"
Monica Geller,"No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special."
Monica Geller,"No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god."
Monica Geller,Oh my god.
Monica Geller,Is your tongue swelling up?
Monica Geller,"All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot."
Monica Geller,Jacket now.
Monica Geller,"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
Monica Geller,"My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally."
Monica Geller,"That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?"
Monica Geller,"Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!"
Monica Geller,Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
Monica Geller,That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Monica Geller,"Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?"
Monica Geller,"Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?"
Monica Geller,No. But I remember people telling me about it.
Monica Geller,Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
Monica Geller,That was you?
Monica Geller,"Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you."
Monica Geller,Please.
Monica Geller,"Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before."
Monica Geller,C'mon give me five more. Five more.
Monica Geller,Five more and I'll flash you.
Monica Geller,"Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes."
Monica Geller,Only if you say his full name.
Monica Geller,Alright.
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,"OK, if you say stop, then we stop."
Monica Geller,"No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo."
Monica Geller,"No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'."
Monica Geller,"Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?"
Monica Geller,"Well, thanks."
Monica Geller,"Well, you know."
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,"Well no, but um."
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . ."
Monica Geller,Alright.
Monica Geller,OK. Just for a little while.
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
Monica Geller,Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Monica Geller,Ohhhh.
Monica Geller,There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Monica Geller,There's an ad for a naked chef?
Monica Geller,Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Monica Geller,We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Monica Geller,"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear."
Monica Geller,I'm sorry?
Monica Geller,Ohh.
Monica Geller,All right. Mmm-mmm.
Monica Geller,"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that."
Monica Geller,Mmm-mmm.
Monica Geller,Wow.
Monica Geller,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Monica Geller,Mmm.
Monica Geller,"Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate."
Monica Geller,"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas."
Monica Geller,How about Mockolate mousse?
Monica Geller,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
Monica Geller,We'll put buckles on it.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"No, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served."
Monica Geller,Oh my god good?
Monica Geller,"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,This was your idea?
Monica Geller,Yeah. You!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?"
Monica Geller,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"Well, uh, I ate some."
Monica Geller,Hello?
Monica Geller,"Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time."
Monica Geller,"Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash."
Monica Geller,Cat hair.
Monica Geller,"Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies."
Monica Geller,"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that."
Monica Geller,"Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy."
Monica Geller,"Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle."
Monica Geller,Cute.
Monica Geller,"Ross, that is gorgeous!"
Monica Geller,"Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy."
Monica Geller,"Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie."
Monica Geller,"Oh, wait a minute honey."
Monica Geller,Wow.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,I hope she's OK.
Monica Geller,How do you know exactly what she's going through?
Monica Geller,Just some stuff for the party.
Monica Geller,"You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?"
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough."
Monica Geller,"For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive."
Monica Geller,"Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?"
Monica Geller,"Ross, the heat!"
Monica Geller,Well put it back.
Monica Geller,"Here, let me try."
Monica Geller,"Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny."
Monica Geller,"No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party."
Monica Geller,"Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright."
Monica Geller,"Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next."
Monica Geller,"No, I will not cave."
Monica Geller,Ross.
Monica Geller,Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Monica Geller,Whatever.
Monica Geller,"So, wait, you really did like my cookies?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier."
Monica Geller,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,Maybe.
Monica Geller,You and me both.
Monica Geller,"OK, I'll see you later babe."
Monica Geller,"Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full."
Monica Geller,"And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend."
Monica Geller,Really? I only had two glasses.
Monica Geller,So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Monica Geller,"Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo."
Monica Geller,"Rach, does this have nonfat milk?"
Monica Geller,"Mmmm, no."
Monica Geller,You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Monica Geller,Bobby.
Monica Geller,"Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you."
Monica Geller,"So, what are you saying now?"
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,You have other friends?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,It's Fun Bobby.
Monica Geller,"Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason."
Monica Geller,"Alright, here you go, sweetie."
Monica Geller,"Oh God, yes!"
Monica Geller,"Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?"
Monica Geller,Oh.... my... God.
Monica Geller,Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Monica Geller,"But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me."
Monica Geller,"She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning."
Monica Geller,See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,Do you not see it?
Monica Geller,"Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you."
Monica Geller,"No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water."
Monica Geller,I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Monica Geller,Morning.
Monica Geller,"Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?"
Monica Geller,"Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing."
Monica Geller,Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
Monica Geller,Sure.
Monica Geller,"Oh God, you fell off the wagon."
Monica Geller,What about me?
Monica Geller,"What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes."
Monica Geller,Oh... shoot.
Monica Geller,OK.
Monica Geller,Take care.
Monica Geller,Well we... we kinda broke up.
Monica Geller,Does anybody want these?
Monica Geller,"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast."
Monica Geller,"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!"
Monica Geller,"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them."
Monica Geller,"Ross, I thought you were over this."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey."
Monica Geller,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck."
Monica Geller,"All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts."
Monica Geller,Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Monica Geller,"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you."
Monica Geller,"Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?"
Monica Geller,"Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it."
Monica Geller,If you want.
Monica Geller,"All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food."
Monica Geller,"I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything."
Monica Geller,"All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!"
Monica Geller,"Joey, speed it up!"
Monica Geller,Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Monica Geller,"All right, you!"
Monica Geller,"All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Monica Geller,"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish."
Monica Geller,So we're back on?
Monica Geller,"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes."
Monica Geller,Would you look at them?
Monica Geller,"Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?"
Monica Geller,"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion."
Monica Geller,And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Monica Geller,"'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'"
Monica Geller,"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building."
Monica Geller,"I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this."
Monica Geller,Excellent!
Monica Geller,"Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon."
Monica Geller,"And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't."
Monica Geller,"Ross, there he is."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
Monica Geller,"Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot."
Monica Geller,"The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?"
Monica Geller,"Rachel, he like, totally changed time."
Monica Geller,"Oh, yeah."
Monica Geller,He could hear me.
Monica Geller,"Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook."
Monica Geller,So what'd he say?
Monica Geller,"Well, thanks anyway."
Monica Geller,"Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do..."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself."
Monica Geller,What did you say?
Monica Geller,"Ya know, you had no right to go out with him."
Monica Geller,You sold me out.
Monica Geller,Yes you did. Absolutely.
Monica Geller,Did you just flick me?
Monica Geller,Quit flicking
Monica Geller,You flicked me first.
Monica Geller,Ow. Ow. Ow.
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,OK.
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,"Fine,"
Monica Geller,"I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?"
Monica Geller,"This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date."
Monica Geller,"Well, what made you make the exception for me?"
Monica Geller,Say you're sorry.
Monica Geller,Say it.
Monica Geller,"Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it."
Monica Geller,Say you're sorry.
Monica Geller,What're you gonna do?
Monica Geller,You don't have the guts.
Monica Geller,I'll help you fix your sweater.
Monica Geller,I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Monica Geller,I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves
Monica Geller,"Well, bye for me too."
Monica Geller,OK.
Monica Geller,"Oh, no no no no no."
Monica Geller,No no no no.
Monica Geller,But no. Maybe if I were baking.
Monica Geller,Bye-bye.
Monica Geller,Great.
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing."
Monica Geller,"A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like."
Monica Geller,You got it.
Monica Geller,"Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce."
Monica Geller,"Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it."
Monica Geller,That's your call.
Monica Geller,"Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos."
Monica Geller,They'r alright.
Monica Geller,"No really, they're OK."
Monica Geller,"Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne."
Monica Geller,I'm outa here.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent."
Monica Geller,"No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you."
Monica Geller,"Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"So, what's this."
Monica Geller,"Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, God forbid."
Monica Geller,Where have you been?
Monica Geller,"No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet."
Monica Geller,"Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it."
Monica Geller,Because they made me.
Monica Geller,In the bank.
Monica Geller,Anything larger back there?
Monica Geller,You have dinosaur checks?
Monica Geller,"Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful."
Monica Geller,"Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then."
Monica Geller,"Hey, you got me, put it in."
Monica Geller,"You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom."
Monica Geller,Over here dad.
Monica Geller,"Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds."
Monica Geller,"Oh, you look so great."
Monica Geller,Oops.
Monica Geller,"Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, dad, turn it off."
Monica Geller,"Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?"
Monica Geller,"Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper."
Monica Geller,I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
Monica Geller,If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Monica Geller,I can't believe you did that.
Monica Geller,"Mom, I'm hungry."
Monica Geller,Alright.
Monica Geller,"Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?"
Monica Geller,Tonight?
Monica Geller,What's tonight?
Monica Geller,"Uh, hello."
Monica Geller,"Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?"
Monica Geller,Yes but my mom got me this job.
Monica Geller,"Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing."
Monica Geller,Sorry we're late.
Monica Geller,"Dr. Burke, it, it's me."
Monica Geller,Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight.
Monica Geller,"I've been great, just great. How have you been?"
Monica Geller,The head tilt?
Monica Geller,I'm sorry.
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's too bad."
Monica Geller,"You've got to get back out there, it's your party."

Monica Geller,"Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency."
Monica Geller,I am not.
Monica Geller,"Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me."
Monica Geller,"Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment."

Monica Geller,"Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke."

Monica Geller,"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up."
Monica Geller,Happy birthday dad.

Monica Geller,Are we still on that?
Monica Geller,I'm a twinkie.

Monica Geller,"God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean."
Monica Geller,Alright.
Monica Geller,You remember that video I found of mom and dad?

Monica Geller,"Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man."
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,"Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier."
Monica Geller,Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Monica Geller,"So, are you sorry that I told them?"
Monica Geller,Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.

Monica Geller,"Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again ."
Monica Geller,GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Monica Geller,I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.

Monica Geller,"I promise you, he would definitely want you back."
Monica Geller,I was.
Monica Geller,Did she leave a number?
Monica Geller,"I don't have her number, butt-munch."
Monica Geller,"I'm not a baby, you're the baby."
Monica Geller,You wanna get out of my face?
Monica Geller,Give me that.
Monica Geller,"Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom."
Monica Geller,I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Monica Geller,I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Monica Geller,It's my TV.
Monica Geller,Bite me.
Monica Geller,"Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me."
Monica Geller,"OK, what're we gonna do about this?"
Monica Geller,"Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here."
Monica Geller,I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Monica Geller,"Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?"
Monica Geller,"Ross, I hated you when we were kids."
Monica Geller,"Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts."
Monica Geller,"Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way."
Monica Geller,Duh-huh!
Monica Geller,Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Monica Geller,Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.

Monica Geller,"Yeah, thanks. You know what?"
Monica Geller,"If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can."
Monica Geller,So what're you gonna do?
Monica Geller,Sure.
Monica Geller,They won't take you to the vet.
Monica Geller,Joey.
Monica Geller,"We, we just wanna see the end."
Monica Geller,"Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place."
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe you don't need them."
Monica Geller,"Shut up, I'm happy."
Monica Geller,"Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy."
Monica Geller,"Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage."
Monica Geller,"Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with."
Monica Geller,"Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?"
Monica Geller,"Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth."
Monica Geller,"Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark."
Monica Geller,Well yeah.
Monica Geller,You really ok with it?
Monica Geller,"Oh, yay. Ok about that two."
Monica Geller,"Well, it just seems like a really small number."
Monica Geller,"And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?"
Monica Geller,But you've only slept with two people.
Monica Geller,"Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right."
Monica Geller,Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.

Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,One two three.
Monica Geller,"Fine, go have sex."
Monica Geller,"It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow."
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,"Wait, he's not here yet."
Monica Geller,Alright.
Monica Geller,Did they just kill off Joey?
Monica Geller,And some of us really have to pee.
Monica Geller,Sorry Joey
Monica Geller,"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,A mirror?
Monica Geller,"Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood."
Monica Geller,Cache? Jaunty?
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, it was incredible."
Monica Geller,Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Monica Geller,"It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard."
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Yes. But all the other ones.
Monica Geller,Isn't it.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Monica Geller,Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!

Monica Geller,One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Monica Geller,We didn't order cake.
Monica Geller,You're right.
Monica Geller,We're good.
Monica Geller,Are you sure this time?
Monica Geller,There is no alley behind Macy's.
Monica Geller,"So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?"
Monica Geller,Nice.
Monica Geller,What about the part where he has rabies?
Monica Geller,"Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves."
Monica Geller,"Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing."
Monica Geller,"Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look."
Monica Geller,"Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?"
Monica Geller,"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?"
Monica Geller,C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Monica Geller,"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag."
Monica Geller,"Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay."
Monica Geller,"Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?"
Monica Geller,So'd you guys have fun?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?"
Monica Geller,Ross.
Monica Geller,"Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?"
Monica Geller,"You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard."
Monica Geller,"So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?"
Monica Geller,You're meeting Richard?
Monica Geller,"Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys."
Monica Geller,With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Monica Geller,So you watched the movies huh?
Monica Geller,"Alright, you wanna feel better?"
Monica Geller,"Ok, here, watch this."
Monica Geller,"So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in."
Monica Geller,There's a game?
Monica Geller,"Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other."
Monica Geller,"Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks."
Monica Geller,"Oh, then go Vassar."
Monica Geller,"Ok, then just go."
Monica Geller,"Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them."
Monica Geller,"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?"
Monica Geller,I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Monica Geller,"Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles."
Monica Geller,Did you like it?
Monica Geller,"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?"
Monica Geller,"Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table."
Monica Geller,Score! Now can we go?
Monica Geller,Um-hmm.
Monica Geller,Nighty-nite.
Monica Geller,So are you ok?
Monica Geller,"Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well they suck too."
Monica Geller,"'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting."
Monica Geller,Really.
Monica Geller,His indian name?
Monica Geller,Wow.
Monica Geller,"Weird, weird."
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
Monica Geller,How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
Monica Geller,I don't want a beer.
Monica Geller,"Hey, I went up."
Monica Geller,"My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it."
Monica Geller,Put all my money in me.

Monica Geller,I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
Monica Geller,"Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?"
Monica Geller,"Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY."
Monica Geller,"Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy."
Monica Geller,"MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down."
Monica Geller,DON'T...be too long with the phone.
Monica Geller,I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Monica Geller,"Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks."
Monica Geller,I've gotta get back in the game.
Monica Geller,"I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it."
Monica Geller,"Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?"
Monica Geller,"But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs."
Monica Geller,"So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Monica Geller,"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want."
Monica Geller,"Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk."
Monica Geller,"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper."
Monica Geller,Joey that is horriable.
Monica Geller,So what happened?
Monica Geller,"Well, how bout just her mom?"
Monica Geller,Cause I already invited her.
Monica Geller,"Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan."
Monica Geller,It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Monica Geller,Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
Monica Geller,"No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye."
Monica Geller,"No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey."
Monica Geller,Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
Monica Geller,"Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
Monica Geller,"So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place."
Monica Geller,Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
Monica Geller,Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
Monica Geller,"Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall."
Monica Geller,"Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now."
Monica Geller,Just go.
Monica Geller,"Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out."
Monica Geller,"Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?"
Monica Geller,"No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker."
Monica Geller,"Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny."
Monica Geller,What? I don't see anything.
Monica Geller,"Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament."
Monica Geller,"You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?"
Monica Geller,Phoebe.
Monica Geller,"Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance..."
Monica Geller,"Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun."
Monica Geller,Ok will do. So glad you came.
Monica Geller,"Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye."
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,"Ok everybody, it's time for flan."
Monica Geller,"Ok, that's enough."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I ordered mine first."
Monica Geller,Give it to me.
Monica Geller,Give it to me.
Monica Geller,"There you go, enjoy your coffee."
Monica Geller,"Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow."
Monica Geller,That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Monica Geller,Had it.
Monica Geller,"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp."
Monica Geller,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Monica Geller,Just waiting for you sweetie.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
Monica Geller,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
Monica Geller,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
Monica Geller,I'm just easing you in.
Monica Geller,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you."
Monica Geller,"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point."
Monica Geller,"You look fabulous honey, you really do."
Monica Geller,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
Monica Geller,This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
Monica Geller,It's for their own good.
Monica Geller,"Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?"
Monica Geller,Very good.
Monica Geller,You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
Monica Geller,I'm gonna set them to my time.
Monica Geller,"No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?"
Monica Geller,"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now."
Monica Geller,No. See you don't understand.
Monica Geller,No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
Monica Geller,Oh yeah.
Monica Geller,"Alright, well tell me one of yours."
Monica Geller,What if they get mixed up?
Monica Geller,"You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing."
Monica Geller,What's up?
Monica Geller,Yeah?
Monica Geller,No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Monica Geller,"No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed."
Monica Geller,"Alright, go on."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, you're a freak."
Monica Geller,Then what's the problem?
Monica Geller,"What, forget it!"
Monica Geller,"Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him."
Monica Geller,"Woo-hoo, stuud!"
Monica Geller,"Woo-hoo, geeek!"
Monica Geller,Please!
Monica Geller,"Bye sweetie, I love you."
Monica Geller,What are you talking about? What wedding?
Monica Geller,"Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'"
Monica Geller,Could not be more terrified.
Monica Geller,"Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is."
Monica Geller,"Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure."
Monica Geller,"Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, am I in it?"
Monica Geller,"Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky."
Monica Geller,Keep talkin'.
Monica Geller,"Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?"
Monica Geller,"Not a basset, a bassinet."
Monica Geller,"Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future."
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,"That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet."
Monica Geller,Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
Monica Geller,"So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them."
Monica Geller,"Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about."
Monica Geller,"Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will."
Monica Geller,"You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do."
Monica Geller,You'll do what?
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one."
Monica Geller,I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Monica Geller,"God, look what I found in the drain."
Monica Geller,It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Monica Geller,"It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!"
Monica Geller,"God, what is wrong with me."
Monica Geller,I need to get some Richard.
Monica Geller,"I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"
Monica Geller,What are you the memory woman?
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Oh, they-they sent me home."
Monica Geller,Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Monica Geller,I know I do.
Monica Geller,"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
Monica Geller,"All right, I'll try not to."
Monica Geller,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Monica Geller,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
Monica Geller,"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
Monica Geller,"So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War."
Monica Geller,"Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away."
Monica Geller,"Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
Monica Geller,"I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?"
Monica Geller,What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,"I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
Monica Geller,"No, I really, really do."
Monica Geller,Really!
Monica Geller,You're not just saying that are you?
Monica Geller,Was he crying?
Monica Geller,"Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
Monica Geller,I think so.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!"
Monica Geller,"Ooh, are you gonna do magic?"
Monica Geller,Hang on a second I just got in.
Monica Geller,Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Monica Geller,"Rach, did you check the machine?"
Monica Geller,Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
Monica Geller,"What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?"
Monica Geller,Huh?
Monica Geller,"If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?"
Monica Geller,"So, should I call him back?"
Monica Geller,I called him.
Monica Geller,"Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?"
Monica Geller,"Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough."
Monica Geller,I know the code to his answering machine.
Monica Geller,"""Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."""
Monica Geller,He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Monica Geller,"Well, who's voice was that?"
Monica Geller,"Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?"
Monica Geller,It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Monica Geller,"Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to."
Monica Geller,Okay. That was her right?
Monica Geller,"See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now."
Monica Geller,"Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that...."
Monica Geller,"Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back."
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine."
Monica Geller,Not any more!
Monica Geller,"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye."
Monica Geller,"Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!"
Monica Geller,"""Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."" Nooo!!"
Monica Geller,I don't know!
Monica Geller,Noooo!!!!
Monica Geller,Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Monica Geller,"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning."
Monica Geller,Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Monica Geller,"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot."
Monica Geller,Hey guys.
Monica Geller,"Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin."
Monica Geller,"Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch."
Monica Geller,"I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies."
Monica Geller,I'm talking about me having a baby.
Monica Geller,"Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan."
Monica Geller,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
Monica Geller,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff."
Monica Geller,"Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis."
Monica Geller,You're gonna what?
Monica Geller,What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Monica Geller,"Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'"
Monica Geller,"Joey, this is you!"
Monica Geller,"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here."
Monica Geller,"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,To the bank.
Monica Geller,Sperm.
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135."
Monica Geller,"'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Really? Why?
Monica Geller,Hoyt?
Monica Geller,"Really, is he a swimmer?"
Monica Geller,I like that. What?
Monica Geller,We do not have one of those signs.
Monica Geller,Two girls and a boy?
Monica Geller,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back."
Monica Geller,"See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere."
Monica Geller,"Oh, now you want a pad."
Monica Geller,I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Monica Geller,"There it is. Joey, what are you doing?"
Monica Geller,"What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you."
Monica Geller,Uff.
Monica Geller,That is never good.
Monica Geller,Ohh!
Monica Geller,Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Monica Geller,"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat."
Monica Geller,"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control."
Monica Geller,Nooo!
Monica Geller,She has to know that your not ready.
Monica Geller,"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
Monica Geller,"You know what, everything's gonna be okay."
Monica Geller,If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Monica Geller,"Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy."
Monica Geller,"Aw, it's soo unfair."
Monica Geller,"What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman."
Monica Geller,"Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
Monica Geller,"The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag."
Monica Geller,How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Monica Geller,Wasn't there a little song?
Monica Geller,'I am Bea.'
Monica Geller,'I drink tea.'
Monica Geller,"'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '"
Monica Geller,A-ha!!!
Monica Geller,Ross!!!
Monica Geller,"No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox."
Monica Geller,"So, Chandler, who's on your list?"
Monica Geller,"First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list."
Monica Geller,Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?
Monica Geller,"Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?"
Monica Geller,I highly doubt that.
Monica Geller,I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Monica Geller,That's a little more than I wanted to see.
Monica Geller,I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Monica Geller,"You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!"
Monica Geller,What kind of karate is that?
Monica Geller,So how's it going with you guys?
Monica Geller,"Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head."
Monica Geller,"Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game."
Monica Geller,"Oh, how do you play the shadow game?"
Monica Geller,I just asked you.
Monica Geller,"No, that is what the game is."
Monica Geller,What's the matter?
Monica Geller,He's retiling my floor.
Monica Geller,"Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it."
Monica Geller,It's beautiful! It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was. Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Monica Geller,And who laminated it?
Monica Geller,Are you serious? Oh my God.
Monica Geller,Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
Monica Geller,"Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?"
Monica Geller,What?!!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone."
Monica Geller,"Oh, then it must've been you. Bye."
Monica Geller,"Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Monica Geller,Chris says they're closing down the bar.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, apparently they're turning it into some kinda coffee place."
Monica Geller,Got me.
Monica Geller,"Hey, did you pick a roommate?"
Monica Geller,Is it the Italian guy?
Monica Geller,He's so cute.
Monica Geller,"Oh look, the pool table's free. Rack 'em up. I'll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, I went to high school with her. Rachel! Hi!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, you can't even see where the Titanic hit it."
Monica Geller,"Awww, just like you always wanted. Congratulations"
Monica Geller,"Aww, not right now."
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,"So, I'll get-get back to my friend."
Monica Geller,"Oh, that'd be great."
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,"Bye! Ten bucks says, I never see that woman again in my life."
Monica Geller,What are you doing with the lamp?
Monica Geller,"Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week."
Monica Geller,"Hi, again."
Monica Geller,"Thank you soo, much."
Monica Geller,You want some help with that?
Monica Geller,Whoa! Are you okay?
Monica Geller,It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Monica Geller,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Monica Geller,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Monica Geller,"This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, here's your penis!"
Monica Geller,Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Monica Geller,So?!
Monica Geller,Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Monica Geller,"I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?"
Monica Geller,"It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it."
Monica Geller,Pheebs?
Monica Geller,Where's your bed?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,Everybody knows!
Monica Geller,"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
Monica Geller,What?!?!
Monica Geller,You can spill. In the sink.
Monica Geller,"I love you, too."
Monica Geller,What? I'm just said.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,Help yourself.
Monica Geller,Phoebe moved out.
Monica Geller,"I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?"
Monica Geller,"Well, I think so."
Monica Geller,"I know, it is isn't it?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
Monica Geller,"Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can."
Monica Geller,I know. Thanks.
Monica Geller,"Hey, are you okay?"
Monica Geller,"Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?"
Monica Geller,I was always Joanne.
Monica Geller,"I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way."
Monica Geller,What's the part?
Monica Geller,Not at these prices.
Monica Geller,"Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy."
Monica Geller,What's this?
Monica Geller,This is not the bed I ordered!
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,Why is this car in my bedroom?
Monica Geller,When did I sign for it?
Monica Geller,Did you make brownies today?
Monica Geller,"Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed."
Monica Geller,Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Monica Geller,"Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed."
Monica Geller,"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
Monica Geller,"So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?"
Monica Geller,"Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!"
Monica Geller,"Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave."
Monica Geller,"He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him."
Monica Geller,No we're not.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Monica Geller,"Okay, we're gonna need a distraction."
Monica Geller,I got it!
Monica Geller,"The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!"
Monica Geller,A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Monica Geller,Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Monica Geller,"Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!"
Monica Geller,Give it. Give it.
Monica Geller,Oh!!
Monica Geller,It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Monica Geller,"Besides, it takes the focus off the hat."
Monica Geller,"Sure, we have no money, go ahead."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Monica Geller,Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
Monica Geller,"Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?"
Monica Geller,You okay?
Monica Geller,"Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident."
Monica Geller,"Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded."
Monica Geller,"All right, we should call somebody."
Monica Geller,How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,No. Why?
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!"
Monica Geller,You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Monica Geller,"And yet, we're still poking him."
Monica Geller,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
Monica Geller,Every year.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the 'Geller Bowl.'"
Monica Geller,"Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind've competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross's nose."
Monica Geller,"To score the winning touchdown, by the way."
Monica Geller,I won the game.
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, I think we should play a game. I mean come on, it's been twelve years."
Monica Geller,Once!!
Monica Geller,Okay. Let's bring it in.
Monica Geller,"Well, why don't we just bunny up."
Monica Geller,Bunny!
Monica Geller,"Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey."
Monica Geller,Phoebe.
Monica Geller,"All right people listen, I've got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again."
Monica Geller,Huddle up.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Okay, Phoebe you know what you're doing right?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, Joey's gonna catch it, and you and I are gonna block."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, I thought you said you know what you're doing?"
Monica Geller,Break.
Monica Geller,Score!! 7 to nothing!
Monica Geller,Losers walk!
Monica Geller,"Come on guys! Let's go! Come on, it's second down."
Monica Geller,"No it's not, it's second."
Monica Geller,"Wow, what?"
Monica Geller,Pulling what? It's second down.
Monica Geller,I heard that!
Monica Geller,"All right, come on guys, let's go! Tie score, and we're runnin' out of time. Forty-two!! Thirty-eight!! Hike!"
Monica Geller,"Run, Phoebe, run!"
Monica Geller,After the snap!
Monica Geller,Does so count!
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, that's fine, maybe you haven't grown up, but I have."
Monica Geller,Dead leg!!
Monica Geller,"No! Listen, I'm not gonna go through this with you again, okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can't blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let's just call this, tie score and it's halftime."
Monica Geller,Y'know what? I'll think you'll play.
Monica Geller,Because the winner gets this!
Monica Geller,"When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out."
Monica Geller,"No it's not! You want it, you're gonna have to win it!"
Monica Geller,"Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game."
Monica Geller,"All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?"
Monica Geller,"All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest."
Monica Geller,Break!
Monica Geller,"Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don't see that everyday, do ya?"
Monica Geller,What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Monica Geller,"Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!"
Monica Geller,"You're so pathetic! Why can't you just accept it, we're winning because I'm better than you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I'll prove it to you, okay. I'll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I'll still win the game."
Monica Geller,"Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls."
Monica Geller,"Come on Rach, come on. Let's see what's it like to be on a winning team for a change."
Monica Geller,All right then.
Monica Geller,Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Monica Geller,"We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you're making out..."
Monica Geller,"Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let's kill 'um!"
Monica Geller,"All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we're down by two points. Two points.... Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long."
Monica Geller,"Honey, there's a reason."
Monica Geller,"All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I'll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break."
Monica Geller,Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
Monica Geller,No! I'm not okay!
Monica Geller,Come on! Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time! Huddle up!
Monica Geller,"All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long."
Monica Geller,Break!
Monica Geller,Let go! I'm a tiny little woman!!
Monica Geller,Ow!!
Monica Geller,Let go!
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Monica Geller,Let go!
Monica Geller,You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Monica Geller,"Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk..."
Monica Geller,"All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this."
Monica Geller,Oh God! I gotta go!
Monica Geller,"Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!"
Monica Geller,Oh God!
Monica Geller,Christmas cookie?
Monica Geller,"Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree."
Monica Geller,Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Monica Geller,"Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?"
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,Um-mm.
Monica Geller,"Wow. Joey, how do you do it?"
Monica Geller,"He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything."
Monica Geller,"I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him."
Monica Geller,"All right, be my guest."
Monica Geller,"Honey, what's the matter?"
Monica Geller,It's Joey's birthday.
Monica Geller,Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Monica Geller,"I know honey, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
Monica Geller,Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Monica Geller,"I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him."
Monica Geller,"Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?"
Monica Geller,Stick out your tongue.
Monica Geller,Oh my!!
Monica Geller,"How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Isn't that great?
Monica Geller,"Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'"
Monica Geller,How ya feelin'?
Monica Geller,What is the worse part?
Monica Geller,"Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead."
Monica Geller,"I mean, was it Gina?"
Monica Geller,"No, no, no, that's Dina."
Monica Geller,That was me.
Monica Geller,That's okay.
Monica Geller,Y'know which one was she again?
Monica Geller,"No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet."
Monica Geller,I guess they're back from their date.
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,I am good. I finished my book.
Monica Geller,I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen."
Monica Geller,"Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number."
Monica Geller,Yay!
Monica Geller,"Oh, that is amazing!"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Are you crazy?!
Monica Geller,"What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?"
Monica Geller,I mean don't you trust her?
Monica Geller,Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Monica Geller,"So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I do know."
Monica Geller,"Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you."
Monica Geller,"Please, I'm not going for anything."
Monica Geller,Would you please go?
Monica Geller,"Look Julio, someone left their book here."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, what are you reading?"
Monica Geller,"Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?"
Monica Geller,Your a poet and don't know it.
Monica Geller,"Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?"
Monica Geller,Mine? Right here?
Monica Geller,"How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it."
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem."
Monica Geller,"Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out."
Monica Geller,"Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work."
Monica Geller,"All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh-ho, look what I got Julio."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, just like the one in the poem."
Monica Geller,What do you mean?
Monica Geller,"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me."
Monica Geller,You don't even know me...
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
Monica Geller,Oh yeah.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Six? I just had it for one night. It's three.
Monica Geller,"Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three."
Monica Geller,Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Monica Geller,"Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks."
Monica Geller,Right.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity."
Monica Geller,It's good to see you too.
Monica Geller,"You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Me too.
Monica Geller,"Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea."
Monica Geller,"No, I just I think that it's too soon."
Monica Geller,Morning.
Monica Geller,"Yeah well, I ran into Richard."
Monica Geller,"Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger."
Monica Geller,Tomorrow night.
Monica Geller,"It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has."
Monica Geller,"We're not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children and I still do, so that's why we're just gonna be friends."
Monica Geller,"You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes."
Monica Geller,You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Monica Geller,Oops.
Monica Geller,Gotta keep squishing.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt."
Monica Geller,"Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be....."
Monica Geller,"Umm, you've got some on your pants."
Monica Geller,"So, how'd the lasagne go over? Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about you too. I know. It's hard this whole platonic thing. It's a word!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart. Yes, I'm sure."
Monica Geller,I'll call you back.
Monica Geller,So we can be friends who sleep together.
Monica Geller,"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,No! No!
Monica Geller,"'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire."
Monica Geller,What are you smiling at?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, right."
Monica Geller,I love this friend thing!
Monica Geller,Ow!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"So um, who was she?"
Monica Geller,"Did you like her? And I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this."
Monica Geller,"Okay, y'know what, I'm not fine, I'm not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... Y'know what, what if we're friends who don't see other people?"
Monica Geller,"Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever."
Monica Geller,"That's not true, you don't have a moustache."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, I've got to walk out of here right now, 'cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don't think I could do it again."
Monica Geller,How 'bout one last game of racquetball?
Monica Geller,Watch the thorns!
Monica Geller,Look at you. All jealous.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, sure."
Monica Geller,Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Monica Geller,"Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, Ginger something."
Monica Geller,"No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'"
Monica Geller,"Well, what did you do?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way."
Monica Geller,You gave her food poisoning!?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?"
Monica Geller,Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Monica Geller,Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Monica Geller,"Well, don't 'cha wanna?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, well I do know you."
Monica Geller,Well so?
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad."
Monica Geller,"So umm, how was your date with Ginger?"
Monica Geller,"Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package."
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,"Sorry, Pheebs."
Monica Geller,We'd love too.
Monica Geller,Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
Monica Geller,"I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95."
Monica Geller,Why? Do you have a report due?
Monica Geller,"Okay, let's start with the free messages outside the UN."
Monica Geller,Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Monica Geller,Where's that?
Monica Geller,I don't have an atlas.
Monica Geller,"Oh, but wait I do have a globe."
Monica Geller,Hold on.
Monica Geller,"'Kay, here you go."
Monica Geller,"It's a globe and, a pencil sharpener."
Monica Geller,"Oh, no thanks."
Monica Geller,"Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?"
Monica Geller,Wow! It's small.
Monica Geller,"So you had fun, huh?"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her."
Monica Geller,"All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel."
Monica Geller,"Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Monica Geller,I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Monica Geller,"Well, I was having a conversation."
Monica Geller,What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Monica Geller,Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Monica Geller,"Hey, the man's dog just died."
Monica Geller,It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,How's the big anniversary dinner?
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, nice."
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!"
Monica Geller,Oh no!!
Monica Geller,"Rachel, you and Mark?!"
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh, there's banana on it."
Monica Geller,So then you know?
Monica Geller,"Oh, good. Thanks."
Monica Geller,"Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing...."
Monica Geller,Yes! Have you seen it?
Monica Geller,I know!!
Monica Geller,Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Monica Geller,Did that!
Monica Geller,Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Monica Geller,"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
Monica Geller,"That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest."
Monica Geller,"Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?"
Monica Geller,Ow!
Monica Geller,Ow!! Ow!!
Monica Geller,Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Monica Geller,"It's okay, it's okay."
Monica Geller,We were just waxing our legs.
Monica Geller,That's right.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Rachel said everything was okay.
Monica Geller,Oh my God.
Monica Geller,Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Monica Geller,"What, what are you doing? You can't go out there."
Monica Geller,Because they'll know we've been listening.
Monica Geller,What if they don't?
Monica Geller,Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Monica Geller,Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Monica Geller,No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Monica Geller,It's never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Monica Geller,"Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!"
Monica Geller,Let's get the show on it!
Monica Geller,"Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it's sooo close."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,We're sorry honey.
Monica Geller,Very bad.
Monica Geller,Chandler!!
Monica Geller,Weren't you nine?!
Monica Geller,"We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first."
Monica Geller,Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
Monica Geller,No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Monica Geller,Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Monica Geller,No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Ow!
Monica Geller,"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
Monica Geller,"So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Please!!
Monica Geller,"These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it's gotta be Rachel."
Monica Geller,"All right then, your bra would still be big."
Monica Geller,Chandler!!
Monica Geller,"Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
Monica Geller,"Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
Monica Geller,So the going for help went well?
Monica Geller,Then why are you smoking?
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up."
Monica Geller,What's 'pleh'?
Monica Geller,Huh. What's doofus spelled backwards?
Monica Geller,"I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?"
Monica Geller,"Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?"
Monica Geller,Here we go again.
Monica Geller,I don't know.
Monica Geller,"What I said was, was that I understood. Joey's the one who agreed with you!"
Monica Geller,"All right, we'll call you when we get back."
Monica Geller,What's so funny?
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?"
Monica Geller,"So, um, how-how did you guys meet?"
Monica Geller,"And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game."
Monica Geller,"Pete, can I get you something else?"
Monica Geller,Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Monica Geller,"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
Monica Geller,"I mean really, think about it."
Monica Geller,"Nah, he doesn't do anything for me."
Monica Geller,"Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Uh, yeah."
Monica Geller,Here you go.
Monica Geller,"As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him."
Monica Geller,That's Bill Clinton.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
Monica Geller,I'm not gonna go out with him.
Monica Geller,Or incredibly offensive.
Monica Geller,What the hell is this?
Monica Geller,"Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?"
Monica Geller,"You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Okay, umm, you're a loon."
Monica Geller,I don't know.
Monica Geller,'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Monica Geller,"Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?"
Monica Geller,I know!!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye."
Monica Geller,"So, where do you want to go?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's sounds great."
Monica Geller,"Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?"
Monica Geller,"Why, how much is that?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, this is so great."
Monica Geller,All right then. Bye.
Monica Geller,"Hello, people who do not live here."
Monica Geller,I gave you a key for emergencies!
Monica Geller,"He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!"
Monica Geller,"Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
Monica Geller,Two.
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,"Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!"
Monica Geller,Sure.
Monica Geller,"Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo."
Monica Geller,"Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
Monica Geller,"So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?"
Monica Geller,I so wanna be attracted to you.
Monica Geller,I'm sorry.
Monica Geller,It's not?
Monica Geller,"Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too."
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
Monica Geller,"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
Monica Geller,Something wrong?
Monica Geller,"Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?"
Monica Geller,"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
Monica Geller,I get the dollhouse!
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
Monica Geller,"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
Monica Geller,"Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!"
Monica Geller,I know!!!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,What's this?
Monica Geller,Not one that can pee on the roof.
Monica Geller,I don't want a ghost.
Monica Geller,"Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go."
Monica Geller,"It's very interesting, Phoebe."
Monica Geller,"Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
Monica Geller,You're kidding?! That's great!
Monica Geller,Oh my.
Monica Geller,"Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?"
Monica Geller,"Hmm, bite me."
Monica Geller,I'm in the shower!
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager."
Monica Geller,I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Monica Geller,"Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate."
Monica Geller,"Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
Monica Geller,That was you?!
Monica Geller,"Hi! Hey, Pete you're back! Hey, check this out."
Monica Geller,Wow! You're a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you're trip?
Monica Geller,"Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?"
Monica Geller,Regular or decaf?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,So what did you do today Pete?
Monica Geller,What?! Oh.
Monica Geller,Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Monica Geller,"I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me."
Monica Geller,"Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
Monica Geller,"Oh, please."
Monica Geller,What? Honey.
Monica Geller,"Oh God, I'm so sorry."
Monica Geller,Oh God!
Monica Geller,Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
Monica Geller,What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Monica Geller,Okay. Here's the thing.
Monica Geller,"I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me...."
Monica Geller,Huh?
Monica Geller,Oh?
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!"
Monica Geller,Okay. Can you give me a little push?
Monica Geller,I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight."
Monica Geller,I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
Monica Geller,Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Monica Geller,Does it have to do with Joey?
Monica Geller,Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Monica Geller,Does it involve travel?
Monica Geller,Does it involve clogs?
Monica Geller,Clogs.
Monica Geller,Claws?!
Monica Geller,"Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?"
Monica Geller,What is it?! What about Pete?
Monica Geller,"Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I gotta go."
Monica Geller,"Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?"
Monica Geller,"I don't believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It's gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I'd be cold, but I'm always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners."
Monica Geller,"Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much."
Monica Geller,Did you just smell my hair?
Monica Geller,Oh God.
Monica Geller,You still have feelings for me don't you?
Monica Geller,Pete.
Monica Geller,"No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice."
Monica Geller,"You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job."
Monica Geller,"And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"Okay, bye."
Monica Geller,"All right shut up for a second and let me just see something. Oh, wow!"
Monica Geller,I need two. I'm bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!
Monica Geller,Really? Who's number two?
Monica Geller,Bye-bye!
Monica Geller,"Joey, what are you doing?! It's never gonna happen, she's seeing somebody."
Monica Geller,Here you go. You can wear this.
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,Phoebe?
Monica Geller,"All right. Honey, that's-that's a sleeve. Okay?"
Monica Geller,And! We also have speaker phone.
Monica Geller,"Okay, wait, you gotta hang up 'cause we're gonna be late."
Monica Geller,Of course not.
Monica Geller,There's our star!
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Yeah. Where were you?
Monica Geller,You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Monica Geller,"Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy."
Monica Geller,Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?
Monica Geller,"Anyway, how did it go with Kate?"
Monica Geller,"Joey, you had the night!"
Monica Geller,"When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!"
Monica Geller,Did you like learn about her family?
Monica Geller,Yes!!
Monica Geller,Oh!
Monica Geller,One.
Monica Geller,We're kidding!
Monica Geller,"Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's been two days."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,Pete's breaking up with me.
Monica Geller,"I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk."
Monica Geller,Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,"I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
Monica Geller,Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Monica Geller,"Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command."
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything."
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,"Joey, put that down! Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay, get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone!"
Monica Geller,I guess that's how.
Monica Geller,"Oh it's umm, good! It's umm, it's good, just here watering the plants."
Monica Geller,"Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news."
Monica Geller,"Oh no-no-no, it's still me."
Monica Geller,"Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon."
Monica Geller,I love you.
Monica Geller,"Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news."
Monica Geller,Oh my.
Monica Geller,And that's Pete's Mom.
Monica Geller,"Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose."
Monica Geller,"Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy."
Monica Geller,"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
Monica Geller,Brides magazines?
Monica Geller,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
Monica Geller,I know. I need more pie.
Monica Geller,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
Monica Geller,"Ooh, nice."
Monica Geller,"Oh, right! I completely forgot about that."
Monica Geller,Yeah?
Monica Geller,Wow.
Monica Geller,What's that?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,You wanna what?!
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Monica Geller,My parents will be so happy.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over..."
Monica Geller,"So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm..."
Monica Geller,I...
Monica Geller,Forget it.
Monica Geller,I have no idea.
Monica Geller,He didn't ask me to marry him.
Monica Geller,He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Monica Geller,I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but without the costumes."
Monica Geller,"So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?"
Monica Geller,What's fish hooking?
Monica Geller,"I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy."
Monica Geller,"Okay, can we please go eat?"
Monica Geller,Anything but stew.
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you."
Monica Geller,Promise me you'll be careful.
Monica Geller,"Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own..."
Monica Geller,How 'bout just a boom?
Monica Geller,"God Ross, what is that?"
Monica Geller,"I love you, Pete!!!"
Monica Geller,Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Monica Geller,Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Monica Geller,"I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets."
Monica Geller,"Well, you're not gonna get going are you?"
Monica Geller,"Well, no. But..."
Monica Geller,That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Monica Geller,You didn't know that already?
Monica Geller,"Okay, just get a lot better. Fast."
Monica Geller,Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
Monica Geller,"Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you."
Monica Geller,Please tell me you're stopping now.
Monica Geller,You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Monica Geller,"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!"
Monica Geller,"Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me."
Monica Geller,Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Monica Geller,Yes?
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,"Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in."
Monica Geller,Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Monica Geller,Thanks!
Monica Geller,Yeah right.
Monica Geller,You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Monica Geller,"Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!"
Monica Geller,Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Monica Geller,"Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!"
Monica Geller,"Seriously, where did you get the hat?"
Monica Geller,What's with all this sand?
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,What are you crazy?!
Monica Geller,"Aww, thank you."
Monica Geller,So what's Phoebe like?
Monica Geller,"Ah no, the other Phoebe, the one you went to go see."
Monica Geller,"Oh well, where is he?!"
Monica Geller,Totally familiar.
Monica Geller,"Well, why would she lie to you?"
Monica Geller,Strip Happy Days Game?
Monica Geller,I think I'll help her out. What is going on here?
Monica Geller,You painting his toenails?
Monica Geller,Chasing him all around the room?
Monica Geller,He's totally flirting with you too.
Monica Geller,Huh?
Monica Geller,You didn't even take off your pants.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Like a log.
Monica Geller,That's that weird voice again.
Monica Geller,Shoot! We're out of soda.
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,"Sweety, what are you talking about?"
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,Ennnh.
Monica Geller,Ow!! Ow!!!
Monica Geller,"Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!"
Monica Geller,It's like two miles!
Monica Geller,Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Monica Geller,What?! What is it?!
Monica Geller,What?!! Gross!!
Monica Geller,Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!
Monica Geller,"Nothing, I don't know."
Monica Geller,Nothing. I'm gonna take a shower.
Monica Geller,"Pass the cheese, please."
Monica Geller,"My God, you can't even look at me! Can you?"
Monica Geller,"What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me."
Monica Geller,"No! Joey, we swore we'd never tell!"
Monica Geller,All right!! All right. I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn't stand. I-I couldn't walk.
Monica Geller,I was in too much pain.
Monica Geller,"You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So..."
Monica Geller,You bet.
Monica Geller,Hey!!
Monica Geller,Gin.
Monica Geller,Will you stop!
Monica Geller,"Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me."
Monica Geller,Gin.
Monica Geller,Will you stop!
Monica Geller,"Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me."
Monica Geller,Yesss!!
Monica Geller,Shhh!
Monica Geller,"Chip, is Chip Matthews."
Monica Geller,"'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
Monica Geller,"I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Monica Geller,"What, that little thing at the prom?"
Monica Geller,"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
Monica Geller,"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
Monica Geller,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made."
Monica Geller,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Monica Geller,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat."
Monica Geller,"Oh, really?!"
Monica Geller,I'll try.
Monica Geller,Why can't you use the phone in here?
Monica Geller,"Ross, don't start."
Monica Geller,"Oh, but it's made her so happy."
Monica Geller,"He is right, isn't he?"
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Monica Geller,Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Monica Geller,"That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind."
Monica Geller,Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Monica Geller,"Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?"
Monica Geller,Is that all?
Monica Geller,"Ohh, how is he?"
Monica Geller,Isn't he an architect now?
Monica Geller,"Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?"
Monica Geller,I do?
Monica Geller,You still work at the multiplex?
Monica Geller,"Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God! What happened?
Monica Geller,"Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?"
Monica Geller,"Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school."
Monica Geller,"No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews."
Monica Geller,I know!
Monica Geller,"Hey, we can take her back with you if you want."
Monica Geller,Me too.
Monica Geller,How desperate am I?
Monica Geller,I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Monica Geller,"Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect."
Monica Geller,You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Monica Geller,"Doing great, the quiches are coming along."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I thought it was cute."
Monica Geller,Let me ask you a question.
Monica Geller,Why did you hire me?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good."
Monica Geller,...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put... Oh my God! It's in the quiche! Oh My God!"
Monica Geller,"Okay ah, please don't freak out. Umm, but ah, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there's no way to know which one."
Monica Geller,Then why are you laughing?
Monica Geller,What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Monica Geller,Frozen lasagnas?
Monica Geller,You bet that I'd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
Monica Geller,"You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase."
Monica Geller,"That's right. My Mom doesn't have any faith in me! Oh, that's hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."
Monica Geller,No! You have lasagnas!
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change."
Monica Geller,"Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make."
Monica Geller,Well?
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,Yes!!
Monica Geller,And you?
Monica Geller,"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you..."
Monica Geller,"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
Monica Geller,Wow!
Monica Geller,"That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails."
Monica Geller,"Hello, Chandler."
Monica Geller,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Monica Geller,Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Monica Geller,Rachel!
Monica Geller,You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Monica Geller,Have you ever taken out the trash?
Monica Geller,Third door on the left.
Monica Geller,God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Monica Geller,"Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it."
Monica Geller,My God! Is this a gym card?
Monica Geller,What's the matter?
Monica Geller,So do them for free.
Monica Geller,Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Monica Geller,You're gonna do some feet flirtin'!
Monica Geller,"What a minute, what did he say?"
Monica Geller,I told you not to go down there!
Monica Geller,Rachel always cries!
Monica Geller,"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!"
Monica Geller,His dancing partner?!
Monica Geller,"Oh, would you let it go already?! You're fine!"
Monica Geller,"Wait, now so you joined the gym?"
Monica Geller,"Well, you could actually go to the gym."
Monica Geller,"Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself."
Monica Geller,"Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?"
Monica Geller,Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Monica Geller,You know the words! You are so into this!
Monica Geller,"All right, then show me some manly moves."
Monica Geller,So you didn't leave the bank?
Monica Geller,Oh my Gosh!
Monica Geller,"Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there."
Monica Geller,"Just be yourself. But, not too much."
Monica Geller,That cold makes you sound so great.
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, I like Kathy."
Monica Geller,"Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!"
Monica Geller,"Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Rachel's not here.
Monica Geller,How's it going with her?
Monica Geller,"Hi, Josh."
Monica Geller,"So, did you play in college? sweatshirt he's wearing.)"
Monica Geller,Very!
Monica Geller,"It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother."
Monica Geller,Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia."
Monica Geller,"Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold."
Monica Geller,Ross isn't here.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,Thank you so much Phoebe.
Monica Geller,What are you doing with those?!
Monica Geller,"Sorry, Phoebe."
Monica Geller,Umm.
Monica Geller,Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Monica Geller,"No, sorry."
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
Monica Geller,"Ross, cough drops, please?"
Monica Geller,You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Monica Geller,"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
Monica Geller,"That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!"
Monica Geller,"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people."
Monica Geller,Sixty guests.
Monica Geller,Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Monica Geller,I don't know.
Monica Geller,Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Monica Geller,"Well, you're not working either."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!"
Monica Geller,"Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!"
Monica Geller,"Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Oh, is everything in the car?"
Monica Geller,No. I hate this part.
Monica Geller,"No, that's not mine."
Monica Geller,"Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen."
Monica Geller,"Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of..."
Monica Geller,Just the matter of ...payment?
Monica Geller,"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me."
Monica Geller,"Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!"
Monica Geller,I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's great! Congratulations!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did."
Monica Geller,And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!"
Monica Geller,I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Monica Geller,"Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister."
Monica Geller,"Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?"
Monica Geller,No?
Monica Geller,"Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound."
Monica Geller,"He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, ""The Sound."""
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific."
Monica Geller,Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Monica Geller,"Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down."
Monica Geller,"Hey, aren't you up next?"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, Ross sucks!"
Monica Geller,"Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too."
Monica Geller,Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Monica Geller,Are you serious?
Monica Geller,You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Monica Geller,He loves you.
Monica Geller,I remember you did.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
Monica Geller,We haven't eaten yet!
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller."
Monica Geller,Who cares? He works in a museum!
Monica Geller,What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills."
Monica Geller,"No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!"
Monica Geller,Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
Monica Geller,Yes!!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Monica Geller,"Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now."
Monica Geller,I was probably waiting for it to open.
Monica Geller,You look great too.
Monica Geller,So how does it look?
Monica Geller,Like a pirate?!
Monica Geller,"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him."
Monica Geller,Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Monica Geller,No way!
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,"Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?"
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,Why is it sick?
Monica Geller,"Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?"
Monica Geller,Me going out with Richard's son.
Monica Geller,"Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!"
Monica Geller,"I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim."
Monica Geller,"Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe."
Monica Geller,And Joey.
Monica Geller,"My brother, Ross."
Monica Geller,And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
Monica Geller,"Umm, well, he's..."
Monica Geller,"All right everybody, this turkey is ready!"
Monica Geller,"Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap."
Monica Geller,See he's nice. Right?
Monica Geller,I saved you a seat.
Monica Geller,"Oh-ho-ho, we've got company."
Monica Geller,"Ooh, this always happens."
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Monica Geller,"I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing."
Monica Geller,We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Monica Geller,Nothing. Nothing.
Monica Geller,"No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss..."
Monica Geller,Don't say it!
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,I know!
Monica Geller,"Oh, he's catching up to her!"
Monica Geller,"Come on, no peeking!"
Monica Geller,"All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though."
Monica Geller,Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Monica Geller,"Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter."
Monica Geller,"Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people."
Monica Geller,"Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners."
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,"All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?"
Monica Geller,Hey! My first review is out!
Monica Geller,"All right, look at my on the back page."
Monica Geller,"Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends."
Monica Geller,Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Monica Geller,Haven't we made this decision?
Monica Geller,Bye!
Monica Geller,Who is it?
Monica Geller,Oh my God.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!"
Monica Geller,"Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away."
Monica Geller,No! Phoebe!
Monica Geller,"I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books."
Monica Geller,The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Monica Geller,"All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Monica Geller,"Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them."
Monica Geller,"Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!"
Monica Geller,Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Monica Geller,You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
Monica Geller,"Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering."
Monica Geller,"I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?"
Monica Geller,I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
Monica Geller,"It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business."
Monica Geller,"All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, wait a minute!"
Monica Geller,"Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out."
Monica Geller,"I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person."
Monica Geller,Or! A bakery delivery person.
Monica Geller,Pizza?!
Monica Geller,"All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver."
Monica Geller,"Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, let's do the catering business."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun."
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,"Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?"
Monica Geller,"Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me."
Monica Geller,"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat."
Monica Geller,I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Monica Geller,"I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life."
Monica Geller,"I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation."
Monica Geller,"That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?"
Monica Geller,"All right, you're hired!"
Monica Geller,Didn't your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Monica Geller,"All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?"
Monica Geller,You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Monica Geller,"You bet your ass, I'm gonna fire you! Thank you."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?!
Monica Geller,Thanks. I think you got it!
Monica Geller,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
Monica Geller,"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?"
Monica Geller,Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Monica Geller,"Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere..."
Monica Geller,"A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!"
Monica Geller,What the hell happened?!
Monica Geller,"Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!"
Monica Geller,What kinda things have you been saying?
Monica Geller,I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Monica Geller,You did a minute ago!
Monica Geller,Fine!
Monica Geller,"Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!"
Monica Geller,That's not funny.
Monica Geller,"I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is..."
Monica Geller,You do?
Monica Geller,Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Monica Geller,You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Monica Geller,How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
Monica Geller,"Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!"
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,Enough!
Monica Geller,"No, you messed it up. You're stupid."
Monica Geller,Are you serious?
Monica Geller,What did you tell them?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, like you're gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant."
Monica Geller,We just want you to think it through.
Monica Geller,I am so jealous.
Monica Geller,In the beginning where y'know it's all sex and talking and sex and talking and...
Monica Geller,And the sex?
Monica Geller,Then what is it?
Monica Geller,"So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed."
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you should."
Monica Geller,Go on.
Monica Geller,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"So, did you do it?"
Monica Geller,"Uh-oh, it was bad?"
Monica Geller,"Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time."
Monica Geller,"All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know. Rach, give me that pad, please? All right. Now..."
Monica Geller,"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!"
Monica Geller,It's kind of an important one!
Monica Geller,"Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp."
Monica Geller,"All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit 'em all, and you mix 'em up. You gotta keep them on their toes."
Monica Geller,"All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I never saw that."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,It's gonna be so great.
Monica Geller,Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Monica Geller,What if I asked?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Boy, you are really not a morning person."
Monica Geller,What kind of changes?
Monica Geller,"Oh, good luck."
Monica Geller,That is sooo not true!
Monica Geller,I just-I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Deal!
Monica Geller,Ha-ha!
Monica Geller,"Aww, man!"
Monica Geller,"That does not mean you know us better, I-I want a rematch."
Monica Geller,Yeah! And the winner gets a hundred bucks.
Monica Geller,Are you scared?
Monica Geller,Ross will do it.
Monica Geller,"You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?"
Monica Geller,Same category?
Monica Geller,"Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!"
Monica Geller,No!!
Monica Geller,I knew that! Rachel! Use you're head!
Monica Geller,Viva Las Gaygas!
Monica Geller,"You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds."
Monica Geller,"Huh, wanna bet?"
Monica Geller,"How about we play for more money, say 150?"
Monica Geller,You're doing it again.
Monica Geller,We won't. 300?
Monica Geller,I'm just trying to spice it up!
Monica Geller,"I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?"
Monica Geller,Deal!
Monica Geller,"Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand."
Monica Geller,"No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me."
Monica Geller,Come on!
Monica Geller,Come on!
Monica Geller,Sandwiches!

Monica Geller,"It's umm, it has something to do with transponding."
Monica Geller,That's not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Monica Geller,NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Monica Geller,"Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something."
Monica Geller,Yeah. I bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are? I'll bet the apartment!
Monica Geller,How do you feel?
Monica Geller,Really?! How much?!
Monica Geller,"Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would've made them get rid of the birds. Right?"
Monica Geller,"All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, it's all your fault."
Monica Geller,"Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!"
Monica Geller,Well?
Monica Geller,"It's only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time."
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?"
Monica Geller,I'll take care of it.
Monica Geller,I lost our mattresses.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, don't mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop."
Monica Geller,"Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!"
Monica Geller,I can't find garbage bags!
Monica Geller,What is it?!
Monica Geller,I can't believe we're living here!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
Monica Geller,"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
Monica Geller,"If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,You made pancakes?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game."
Monica Geller,The players.
Monica Geller,"Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is."
Monica Geller,Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Monica Geller,"Please, have some!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I've just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it's just something I picked up."
Monica Geller,Wait! Wait! This isn't take-out!
Monica Geller,"No, wait, please don't go! I've got porn for you too!"
Monica Geller,People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Monica Geller,"I'm the hostess! Not those guys! I'm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air."
Monica Geller,"'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I'm-I'm done now. They've suffered enough."
Monica Geller,"All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!"
Monica Geller,Are you sure?
Monica Geller,"Nah, I got it."
Monica Geller,"Okay, it's ready. Come on."
Monica Geller,Just come.
Monica Geller,"Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?"
Monica Geller,You used to have carpet.
Monica Geller,"So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I'm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit."
Monica Geller,"Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I'm always the hostess."
Monica Geller,"Hey umm, what's this?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?"
Monica Geller,What's Phase Two?
Monica Geller,You stink!
Monica Geller,"Uh-oh, what's the matter?"
Monica Geller,I don't know sweetie.
Monica Geller,I can't! I have to work!
Monica Geller,"No, Chandler's still in Phase One, and Joey's that thing you smell."
Monica Geller,I think she's here.
Monica Geller,"Ohh, she's looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you? Hello!"
Monica Geller,I-I-I think you look great.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah. Run ten blocks, that'll help the smell."
Monica Geller,So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,So you hit her in the face?
Monica Geller,Hey! You're wearing pants!
Monica Geller,It's 9:30 in the morning!
Monica Geller,"Hello. Oh, hey Ross!"
Monica Geller,"Oh-oh, my God!"
Monica Geller,"Shh!! Wait, what?"
Monica Geller,He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Monica Geller,"He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard."
Monica Geller,Why do you care so much anyway?
Monica Geller,"Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail."
Monica Geller,A couple of days.
Monica Geller,What are you doing?! Chandler! You can't just go back a phase!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, come on, we can be guys!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I've got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?"
Monica Geller,"Very good, so good."
Monica Geller,"When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
Monica Geller,Oh! And don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Monica Geller,I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Monica Geller,"So, we did okay at the strip club, right?"
Monica Geller,"What, he doesn't like Josh?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah. And y'know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too."
Monica Geller,Come on! Chandler!
Monica Geller,"They really were pretty, weren't they?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I think if I were going to be with a woman. It'd, it'd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite."
Monica Geller,"Oh, Chantal!"
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,That's-that's not Phase Three.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Wait, now, what am I doing again?"
Monica Geller,Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Monica Geller,Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Monica Geller,They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
Monica Geller,Janice?!
Monica Geller,How have you been?
Monica Geller,Done?
Monica Geller,"This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?"
Monica Geller,He asked you out?!
Monica Geller,Saucy!
Monica Geller,Electrical plans for the building.
Monica Geller,"I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours."
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?"
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, no!"
Monica Geller,"I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture."
Monica Geller,"Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!"
Monica Geller,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Monica Geller,"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs."
Monica Geller,But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Monica Geller,All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Monica Geller,"I guess Joey was right, it does nothing."
Monica Geller,What is it hon?
Monica Geller,"Aww, honey I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff."
Monica Geller,"Oh no, two days, you must be bummed."
Monica Geller,You changed?
Monica Geller,"And lucky means, more cleavage?"
Monica Geller,"Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe."
Monica Geller,Or Spin the Bottle?
Monica Geller,Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Monica Geller,"Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens."
Monica Geller,I think you're done.
Monica Geller,"Well at least, I'm going to mute it."
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Monica Geller,You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Monica Geller,"Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?"
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again."
Monica Geller,Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Monica Geller,"No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together."
Monica Geller,"Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!"
Monica Geller,Do you love her?
Monica Geller,You love her!
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And she's gonna say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud."
Monica Geller,"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn."
Monica Geller,Where ya going?
Monica Geller,How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Monica Geller,Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Monica Geller,"And well, what did she say?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?"
Monica Geller,It is not over! You're over!
Monica Geller,You know!
Monica Geller,"It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?"
Monica Geller,Are you sure?
Monica Geller,"This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy."
Monica Geller,Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Monica Geller,You have to go to London!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
Monica Geller,"When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?"
Monica Geller,"You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?"
Monica Geller,"All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!"
Monica Geller,Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Monica Geller,All right.
Monica Geller,"Okay, good luck!"
Monica Geller,"That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?"
Monica Geller,Hello.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?"
Monica Geller,"All right. When is, when is the next flight out?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home."
Monica Geller,What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?"
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Monica Geller,Um-hmm.
Monica Geller,"Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke."
Monica Geller,"So, you wore your nightie to dinner?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, no!"
Monica Geller,Emily's straight.
Monica Geller,This totally makes sense!
Monica Geller,"Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!"
Monica Geller,This is so much fun!
Monica Geller,"Look, all we're trying to say is, don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily."
Monica Geller,"Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Shut up! This place is a hole!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, apparently, they're pretty good seats."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?"
Monica Geller,What do you say?
Monica Geller,Have you even had a girl up here?
Monica Geller,"All right boys, last chance for the tickets!"
Monica Geller,"All right, so what do you say?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, just do it!!"
Monica Geller,They're green?
Monica Geller,That's not even a game!
Monica Geller,"You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, good."
Monica Geller,Okay. Four.
Monica Geller,Because we won our apartment back!
Monica Geller,"No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!"
Monica Geller,"But, we pick again! We pick again!"
Monica Geller,I don't know!
Monica Geller,"We'll discuss it, in the morning!"
Monica Geller,"No, we're not! We're not leaving!"
Monica Geller,"As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute."
Monica Geller,Men are such idiots.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true."
Monica Geller,What-what's going on?
Monica Geller,"When, when did-how, how did you..."
Monica Geller,I can't believe you're getting married!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!"
Monica Geller,He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
Monica Geller,"Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over..."
Monica Geller,He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Monica Geller,Have you guys picked a date yet?
Monica Geller,"Ugh, she's upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I'm not doing them this time! I don't care if those dishes sit in the sink until they're all covered with-I'll do them when I get home!"
Monica Geller,I'll pick it up for you!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It's so beautiful!
Monica Geller,"Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold."
Monica Geller,Emily Waltham.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"I am, aren't I?"
Monica Geller,Yes?
Monica Geller,All right.
Monica Geller,Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does.
Monica Geller,"Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming. Uh, just a second!"
Monica Geller,Phoebe?
Monica Geller,Can you just hold on for one minute?
Monica Geller,Are you alone?
Monica Geller,All right.
Monica Geller,"Okay, ready?"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Congratulations!
Monica Geller,Okay! My turn! My turn!
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,That was a terrible throw!!
Monica Geller,"Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?"
Monica Geller,This isn't even my dress.
Monica Geller,I'm changing out of this.
Monica Geller,In like a half-hour?
Monica Geller,"Okay, throw it straight this time."
Monica Geller,I'm getting married next!!
Monica Geller,"Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?"
Monica Geller,Oh God.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?"
Monica Geller,"No, seriously."
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!"
Monica Geller,"Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again."
Monica Geller,Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be."
Monica Geller,Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Monica Geller,"No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!"
Monica Geller,Rachel?!
Monica Geller,"Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
Monica Geller,"Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,I never knew that either.
Monica Geller,We're hanging out.
Monica Geller,I'm sorry honey.
Monica Geller,"Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?"
Monica Geller,"You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?"
Monica Geller,I can't believe he did this.
Monica Geller,"You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom."
Monica Geller,"Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds."
Monica Geller,"Oh, dad, turn it off."
Monica Geller,If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Monica Geller,I can't believe you did that.
Monica Geller,Nooooo. You're really not going?
Monica Geller,You don't have a car. And your license expired.
Monica Geller,That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,I thought that was a good thing.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet."
Monica Geller,Why do you need it?
Monica Geller,"What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?"
Monica Geller,Sooo?
Monica Geller,Nooo!
Monica Geller,The baby shower for Phoebe!
Monica Geller,Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Monica Geller,"Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite."
Monica Geller,I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Monica Geller,Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila."
Monica Geller,"Oh, she's gonna love that!"
Monica Geller,Hi Phoebe.
Monica Geller,Hormones.
Monica Geller,"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?"
Monica Geller,Here's your tea Phoebe.
Monica Geller,I'm so glad you liked it.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!"
Monica Geller,"Rachel, get the book! The book!"
Monica Geller,The Bible?!
Monica Geller,How do you feel?
Monica Geller,Some moms do that.
Monica Geller,"Aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything. You're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better."
Monica Geller,"I mean, you're the one they're gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Oh, sweetie!"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!"
Monica Geller,"Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!"
Monica Geller,"Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Yep! You got the tickets?
Monica Geller,"Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator..."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, okay, give that a try!"
Monica Geller,"All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!"
Monica Geller,Chicken Kiev?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!"
Monica Geller,It's nice.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened."
Monica Geller,They tore it down a few days early.
Monica Geller,Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Monica Geller,Oowww!!
Monica Geller,"You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!"
Monica Geller,"But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me."
Monica Geller,"Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Yes, I did! And you are welcome!"
Monica Geller,Umm...
Monica Geller,She said that?!
Monica Geller,Why?!
Monica Geller,Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
Monica Geller,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?"
Monica Geller,"Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was."
Monica Geller,Sometimes we were.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,You'll see.
Monica Geller,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go."
Monica Geller,Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!"
Monica Geller,"Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries."
Monica Geller,And I'm going to go get drunk.
Monica Geller,I was laughing.
Monica Geller,Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Monica Geller,"My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that."
Monica Geller,"Well, thanks, we like him."
Monica Geller,Then why would he say it?
Monica Geller,"Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married."
Monica Geller,"Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!"
Monica Geller,Do you think he knew I was here?
Monica Geller,Nope.
Monica Geller,"Yep, yep...You?"
Monica Geller,Well...I'd better get going.
Monica Geller,Could you not look?
Monica Geller,"Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good."
Monica Geller,You can let some of them go by!
Monica Geller,Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Monica Geller,Stupid.
Monica Geller,What were we thinking?
Monica Geller,Oh yeah. Definitely.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,I know. How could we have let this happen?
Monica Geller,"Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away..."
Monica Geller,I blame London.
Monica Geller,"So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?"
Monica Geller,Only here.
Monica Geller,I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Monica Geller,Now?
Monica Geller,"Oh, I-I don't know."
Monica Geller,"Just uh, do the right thing."
Monica Geller,Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
Monica Geller,"Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you."
Monica Geller,Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Monica Geller,Why?!
Monica Geller,"Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!"
Monica Geller,That's true.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!"
Monica Geller,How did you get in here?
Monica Geller,"Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?"
Monica Geller,Fifteen minutes.
Monica Geller,Great...
Monica Geller,But my clothes are-ohh!
Monica Geller,No time for that!
Monica Geller,"Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!"
Monica Geller,You really think this is okay?
Monica Geller,"Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this."
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,You didn't find her?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I think you should keep looking!"
Monica Geller,Or 45.
Monica Geller,"Well, it's getting late."
Monica Geller,"Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
Monica Geller,"I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again."
Monica Geller,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?"
Monica Geller,I know!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, I did not have sex."
Monica Geller,"Well, we certainly are alone."
Monica Geller,"Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother..."
Monica Geller,"Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks."
Monica Geller,That's okay.
Monica Geller,And you're cute too.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,That counts!
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,I know. How could we have let this happen?
Monica Geller,"Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away..."
Monica Geller,I blame London.
Monica Geller,"So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?"
Monica Geller,Only here.
Monica Geller,I'll meet you there in two minutes.

Monica Geller,That's okay.
Monica Geller,And you're cute too.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,That counts!
Monica Geller,You look cute in bubbles.
Monica Geller,Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Monica Geller,"Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?"
Monica Geller,Bodington's!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now."
Monica Geller,"No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece."
Monica Geller,"Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!"
Monica Geller,I'll do it!
Monica Geller,"Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception."
Monica Geller,"Honey, sweetie, by the edges."
Monica Geller,Ohh.
Monica Geller,Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Monica Geller,"Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me."
Monica Geller,"If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute."
Monica Geller,"Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time."
Monica Geller,"You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him."
Monica Geller,We got out pictures back from London. Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Monica Geller,What happened?
Monica Geller,"See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!"
Monica Geller,What took you so long?
Monica Geller,"Oh, good."
Monica Geller,"Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London."
Monica Geller,Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Monica Geller,What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Monica Geller,"I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?"
Monica Geller,What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Monica Geller,"I make the decisions, and I say no."
Monica Geller,"You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, ""I'm not fired!"" Ha!"
Monica Geller,Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Monica Geller,Rachel locked the door.
Monica Geller,Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Monica Geller,"Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?"
Monica Geller,I really need to talk to you.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?"
Monica Geller,"Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting."
Monica Geller,"All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't."
Monica Geller,Please!
Monica Geller,"Joey, I'm in!"
Monica Geller,"Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!"
Monica Geller,Makes me wanna puke!
Monica Geller,"Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?"
Monica Geller,"Come on Rach, let's go."
Monica Geller,"No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him."
Monica Geller,"Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?"
Monica Geller,Okay. I-I can't watch.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! You're water broke!
Monica Geller,I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Monica Geller,Do you know anything about women?
Monica Geller,That's all right.
Monica Geller,"Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket."
Monica Geller,Oh man! I did it again!
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,That's what it sounded like.
Monica Geller,Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Monica Geller,"Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true."
Monica Geller,Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Monica Geller,"Umm, listen there's something I think you should know."
Monica Geller,"Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him."
Monica Geller,Feeling a little better sweetie?
Monica Geller,Me too.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,How are you doing?
Monica Geller,"Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!"
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,"So, why wait 'til Saturday, are you free tomorrow?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, great!"
Monica Geller,Bye Dan!
Monica Geller,Great!
Monica Geller,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him."
Monica Geller,I think you're better than you think you are.
Monica Geller,Know when to stop.
Monica Geller,"Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance."
Monica Geller,I think you're my favorite.
Monica Geller,I don't care.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!"
Monica Geller,Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap."
Monica Geller,"Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!"
Monica Geller,"Uh-huh, that one!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross."
Monica Geller,But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Monica Geller,"Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?"
Monica Geller,Oh that's great!
Monica Geller,What's wrong with PBS?
Monica Geller,"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
Monica Geller,I might've said that. Why is that funny?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,That's great!
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,But you live here! You know that.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife."
Monica Geller,Sure!
Monica Geller,"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend."
Monica Geller,Great!
Monica Geller,What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
Monica Geller,"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife."
Monica Geller,"No, you cannot."
Monica Geller,Hello.
Monica Geller,"Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?"
Monica Geller,You're not on TV.
Monica Geller,Hi Chandler.
Monica Geller,"Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day."
Monica Geller,"William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, so?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass."
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!"
Monica Geller,"All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me."
Monica Geller,Keep talking.
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?"
Monica Geller,"But, I just cleaned the bathroom."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Ow!
Monica Geller,I know!
Monica Geller,Never done that before.
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like."
Monica Geller,I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Monica Geller,All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Monica Geller,"Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!"
Monica Geller,Wait! What about Joey?
Monica Geller,"Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey."
Monica Geller,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"No, she's out shopping."
Monica Geller,"Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?"
Monica Geller,"Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles..."
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry."
Monica Geller,"Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!"
Monica Geller,"Come here. Okay, be right back."
Monica Geller,We're switching rooms.
Monica Geller,"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?"
Monica Geller,We're switching rooms again.
Monica Geller,"This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room."
Monica Geller,"Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?"
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,"Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, this one I like!"
Monica Geller,Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Monica Geller,"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!"
Monica Geller,"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!"
Monica Geller,"We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?"
Monica Geller,What did you say?
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food."
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half."
Monica Geller,300 dollars?!
Monica Geller,Urghh!!
Monica Geller,Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Monica Geller,Maybe I could do it.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,You're not gonna be phased out!
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it did."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Why, exactly?"
Monica Geller,Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
Monica Geller,"You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about."
Monica Geller,"Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!"
Monica Geller,I'm afraid so.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator."
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine."
Monica Geller,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
Monica Geller,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell."
Monica Geller,"I know, it's great!"
Monica Geller,"Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count."
Monica Geller,Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Monica Geller,"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!"
Monica Geller,"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Sorry.
Monica Geller,Rachel's at work.
Monica Geller,"Hey, what's that?"
Monica Geller,What is that?
Monica Geller,This is all of your things.
Monica Geller,"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale."
Monica Geller,Now calm down Joey.
Monica Geller,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?"
Monica Geller,"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron."
Monica Geller,"All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Monica Geller,"We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!"
Monica Geller,"And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!"
Monica Geller,"Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!"
Monica Geller,We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Wow! That guy is so rude!
Monica Geller,Well you did a little bit.
Monica Geller,I totally forgive you!
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Monica Geller,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated."
Monica Geller,"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy."
Monica Geller,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross."
Monica Geller,"Whatever you decide, whatever you do."
Monica Geller,Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Monica Geller,"Hey, look at you! Where have you been?"
Monica Geller,How did that happen?
Monica Geller,"I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready."
Monica Geller,"Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together."
Monica Geller,"I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second."
Monica Geller,How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Monica Geller,"Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering."
Monica Geller,"Oh, Larry."
Monica Geller,"Okay, knock yourself out, Larry."
Monica Geller,Larry?
Monica Geller,"Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen."
Monica Geller,"It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it."
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,Hmm?
Monica Geller,"He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try..."
Monica Geller,"Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married."
Monica Geller,Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Monica Geller,"Ohh, fun!"
Monica Geller,"Well, I guess we won't be warming his house."
Monica Geller,And you're not gonna do that.
Monica Geller,So-so there is no party.
Monica Geller,"I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by."
Monica Geller,You are?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Monica Geller,Great. So the ball is in his court?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"I don't know, clean places?"
Monica Geller,It's Danny.
Monica Geller,We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
Monica Geller,The fake kind!
Monica Geller,We have a ladle.
Monica Geller,"Okay, great!"
Monica Geller,Just go over and say hi.
Monica Geller,"Hey, Danny!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, it's a great party! Great food. Y'know, most parties it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. So umm, what's this?"
Monica Geller,Ooooh! And-and-and what-what's this?
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,I thought there wasn't a ball?
Monica Geller,I think I need a drink.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you have to lift it and point."
Monica Geller,That's very nice.
Monica Geller,Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Monica Geller,"Oh, let's not tell this story."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?"
Monica Geller,What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Monica Geller,"Well, get it off now!"
Monica Geller,"Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!"
Monica Geller,That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Monica Geller,"Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story."
Monica Geller,"Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!"
Monica Geller,I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
Monica Geller,"Oh, why? Why? What happened?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower."
Monica Geller,Ross!
Monica Geller,"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
Monica Geller,"Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner."
Monica Geller,dammit!
Monica Geller,I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Monica Geller,Call them mom and dad you loser!
Monica Geller,Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Oh that's so great!
Monica Geller,"Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything."
Monica Geller,"I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!"
Monica Geller,"No. No, thank you!"
Monica Geller,"Well, I do."
Monica Geller,"Yes, it was!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!"
Monica Geller,"Hi, Chandler."
Monica Geller,"What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?"
Monica Geller,"So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner."
Monica Geller,Well it didn't!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!"
Monica Geller,How?
Monica Geller,"What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!"
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Monica Geller,"Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?"
Monica Geller,What do you mean?
Monica Geller,I can do that!
Monica Geller,"Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek."
Monica Geller,"Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that-"
Monica Geller,"Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!"
Monica Geller,What?! What is it?
Monica Geller,"God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!"
Monica Geller,"Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!"
Monica Geller,I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Monica Geller,I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I said I was sorry."
Monica Geller,"Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?"
Monica Geller,"Wait, wait, wait!"
Monica Geller,Look!
Monica Geller,I bet this will work!
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Monica Geller,"Yes, you did!"
Monica Geller,You love me!
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"Thank you Joey, thank you so much!"
Monica Geller,"Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot."
Monica Geller,"We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret."
Monica Geller,We are! Help us!
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you are a bad ass!"
Monica Geller,Phoebe?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller."
Monica Geller,We're so sorry.
Monica Geller,"Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time."
Monica Geller,"Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview."
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,"Ross, are you okay?"
Monica Geller,Why?!
Monica Geller,A pill?
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?"
Monica Geller,I know! I know! I know!
Monica Geller,Give me that!
Monica Geller,It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Monica Geller,Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Monica Geller,Oh no!
Monica Geller,Yes it's true.
Monica Geller,I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
Monica Geller,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Monica Geller,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Monica Geller,All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Monica Geller,Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah! We should have essay questions!!
Monica Geller,"You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular."
Monica Geller,"Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?"
Monica Geller,Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Monica Geller,Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,I just wanted to see how it's going.
Monica Geller,"Well good, here let me help you out."
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Yeah. I guess.
Monica Geller,"Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, what's up?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,You had no relationship!!
Monica Geller,"Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl."
Monica Geller,"Come on, hurry!"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Eww!!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Sure.
Monica Geller,"All the time. In fact, I was undefeated."
Monica Geller,"Still, I was quick as a cat."
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're kidding."
Monica Geller,"We don't, we don't wrestle now."
Monica Geller,Too strong for me?
Monica Geller,"You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?"
Monica Geller,Ready? Wrestle!
Monica Geller,That was unbelievable!
Monica Geller,"Hi, how are you doing Kelly?"
Monica Geller,It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Monica Geller,This is disgusting!
Monica Geller,"Oh no, wait! Joey!"
Monica Geller,Happy New Year.
Monica Geller,She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less."
Monica Geller,"Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would."
Monica Geller,Hi Ben!
Monica Geller,I like 'em.
Monica Geller,I like them a lot.
Monica Geller,It's my New Year's resolution!
Monica Geller,No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Monica Geller,"Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big..."
Monica Geller,"We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry."
Monica Geller,"Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you! Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!"
Monica Geller,"See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something."
Monica Geller,"Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry."
Monica Geller,"Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?"
Monica Geller,I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Monica Geller,"Ooh, and I can do this."
Monica Geller,"Hi, nice to meet you!"
Monica Geller,What was that?
Monica Geller,That noise you just made?
Monica Geller,Really? Your work laugh?
Monica Geller,"All right, check me out."
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Hey, I thought you already had one."
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Monica Geller,"Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good."
Monica Geller,Okay. Umm...
Monica Geller,"Okay, what's going on with you?"
Monica Geller,"Well, I-I-there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore."
Monica Geller,"Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?"
Monica Geller,Game!
Monica Geller,"Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!"
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said."
Monica Geller,"Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills."
Monica Geller,They have racquets don't they?!
Monica Geller,I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Monica Geller,I got it!
Monica Geller,I got it!!
Monica Geller,I can't believe you let them win!
Monica Geller,I was frustrated.
Monica Geller,I was frustrated with you!
Monica Geller,"Y'know what really bothers me? Is-it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the ""I'll see you around, Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first, Doug!"" I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up."
Monica Geller,"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Where the hell have you been?!!
Monica Geller,My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Monica Geller,"Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big......ot."
Monica Geller,Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Monica Geller,Me and Chandler?!
Monica Geller,"Oh, none for me. Thanks."
Monica Geller,How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things."
Monica Geller,I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Monica Geller,"Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke."
Monica Geller,"Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?"
Monica Geller,I thought you could use the help.
Monica Geller,Sorry! I'm just-I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Monica Geller,I know! It's just that...ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Monica Geller,"Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!"
Monica Geller,Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Monica Geller,Okay great!
Monica Geller,"Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!"
Monica Geller,"Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,I'll get back to my new job.
Monica Geller,I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Monica Geller,That was a half an hour?
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!"
Monica Geller,"It's so good, isn't it?"
Monica Geller,Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Monica Geller,Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Monica Geller,"Ohh my God, I'm so sorry."
Monica Geller,"Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?"
Monica Geller,What?! What honey?
Monica Geller,"Oh, did you catch him?!"
Monica Geller,"All right, let's go say good-bye."
Monica Geller,"Well, at least you scared someone."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you."
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
Monica Geller,No he's not!
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Monica Geller,But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, ""I don't like your massages."""
Monica Geller,See? It's no big deal.
Monica Geller,I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Monica Geller,My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Monica Geller,I'm crying here!!
Monica Geller,"Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?"
Monica Geller,"So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?"
Monica Geller,Okay. I suck!
Monica Geller,"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag."
Monica Geller,You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Monica Geller,"Okay, now you're even cuter!!"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,That's not possible!
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way."
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her."
Monica Geller,This bicep?
Monica Geller,"Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry."
Monica Geller,"Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Monica Geller,"Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?"
Monica Geller,Well what did you send?
Monica Geller,Bye!
Monica Geller,"Actually, I did!"
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
Monica Geller,Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Monica Geller,Them?! Who's them?
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,Unless...
Monica Geller,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So..."
Monica Geller,"All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!"
Monica Geller,"Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!"
Monica Geller,Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Monica Geller,Just go get some! Go!
Monica Geller,She's bluffing!
Monica Geller,You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Monica Geller,Of course.
Monica Geller,I love you too Chandler.
Monica Geller,"Well actually, Ross doesn't."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?!
Monica Geller,"Come on Chandler, come on, I can handle Ross. Hold on! Hey Ross. What's up bro?"
Monica Geller,"I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but it's true, I love him too."
Monica Geller,"Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us."
Monica Geller,But what?
Monica Geller,"In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?"
Monica Geller,"I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?"
Monica Geller,Isn't this great?
Monica Geller,Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Monica Geller,Are you okay?
Monica Geller,What-what are you doing?
Monica Geller,"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!"
Monica Geller,Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Monica Geller,Oh and you know what I want!
Monica Geller,I do not have baby fever!
Monica Geller,"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!"
Monica Geller,You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!
Monica Geller,"Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?"
Monica Geller,I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one."
Monica Geller,I'm Monica.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica Geller,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, why are you doing this?"
Monica Geller,Chandler.
Monica Geller,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds."
Monica Geller,Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Monica Geller,Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?"
Monica Geller,"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Yes, you are so smart!"
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!"
Monica Geller,"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but..."
Monica Geller,Yes! You are so smart! I love you.
Monica Geller,Wow!
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?"
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you."
Monica Geller,Are you saying I smell bad?
Monica Geller,What's with him?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!"
Monica Geller,"Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this."
Monica Geller,What is going on with you?
Monica Geller,What was the dream about?
Monica Geller,"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!"
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too."
Monica Geller,Um-hmm.
Monica Geller,"Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!"
Monica Geller,You become friends after?
Monica Geller,That's right.
Monica Geller,"Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!"
Monica Geller,What about the closeness?
Monica Geller,Who is it?
Monica Geller,Let me try.
Monica Geller,Did I squeeze it too hard?
Monica Geller,Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Monica Geller,"Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!"
Monica Geller,"Wow! She is pretty, huh?"
Monica Geller,What happened?
Monica Geller,"No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?"
Monica Geller,I know it is the best.
Monica Geller,What? It's still going on.
Monica Geller,"I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time."
Monica Geller,What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Monica Geller,"Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!"
Monica Geller,You are so cute.
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!"
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,A kiss? What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?"
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,"Oh, we're not seeing a movie!"
Monica Geller,"Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?"
Monica Geller,Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Monica Geller,Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Monica Geller,"'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!"
Monica Geller,So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Monica Geller,Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Monica Geller,We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Monica Geller,"No, you're the best."
Monica Geller,I am the best.
Monica Geller,Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,"What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!"
Monica Geller,"No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong."
Monica Geller,"You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair."
Monica Geller,You didn't!
Monica Geller,The park huh? A public place.
Monica Geller,I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Monica Geller,Hi Chandler.
Monica Geller,Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Monica Geller,"Come on, we can't let them win!"
Monica Geller,Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Monica Geller,I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
Monica Geller,Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Did not.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I freaked out a little."
Monica Geller,Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Monica Geller,"Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me."
Monica Geller,"I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends."
Monica Geller,I would love to do it together!
Monica Geller,It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Monica Geller,That doesn't seem fair.
Monica Geller,"Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, me too!"
Monica Geller,"All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food."
Monica Geller,"Oh, we're not doing that. Okay..."
Monica Geller,"What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!"
Monica Geller,Cups.
Monica Geller,And ice!
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant..."
Monica Geller,Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's ""Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"""
Monica Geller,You got a callback too didn't you?
Monica Geller,How did work go?
Monica Geller,You stink!
Monica Geller,"No, I'm-I'm serious!"
Monica Geller,That's so gross!
Monica Geller,"Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding."
Monica Geller,Why don't you just go out with her!
Monica Geller,Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Monica Geller,Y'know...go! Go! Right there!
Monica Geller,That's the surprise!
Monica Geller,Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Monica Geller,"So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London..."
Monica Geller,Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Monica Geller,That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Monica Geller,That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Monica Geller,You have got to go home!
Monica Geller,You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Monica Geller,Great!
Monica Geller,Rach? What are you doing?
Monica Geller,It's a diaper commercial.
Monica Geller,What's goin' on?
Monica Geller,"It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine."
Monica Geller,"It's no big deal, I do it all the time."
Monica Geller,Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this actually bothers you?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over."
Monica Geller,No you didn't.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it's good."
Monica Geller,"Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me."
Monica Geller,"Go on, teach me something about men and women."
Monica Geller,No way!
Monica Geller,Well that's pathetic!
Monica Geller,And this goes for all guys?
Monica Geller,No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, what is it?"
Monica Geller,"Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it."
Monica Geller,"All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose."
Monica Geller,Look at you! Come here! Feel better?
Monica Geller,"That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!! Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!"
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,What about these? These look the same?
Monica Geller,Not as each other!
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier."
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, the earrings..."
Monica Geller,My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Monica Geller,"Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?"
Monica Geller,"You can also find him under umm, dog and dead."
Monica Geller,"All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one."
Monica Geller,I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Monica Geller,"All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash."
Monica Geller,"Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around..."
Monica Geller,"What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!"
Monica Geller,Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Monica Geller,"I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila."
Monica Geller,See if he has ice.
Monica Geller,Nooo!
Monica Geller,"Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!"
Monica Geller,"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?"
Monica Geller,"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?"
Monica Geller,"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him."
Monica Geller,"All right, I guess we should go."
Monica Geller,Oh yeah right!
Monica Geller,There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Monica Geller,"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it."
Monica Geller,Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Monica Geller,"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys."
Monica Geller,No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Monica Geller,"So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Monica Geller,"I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral..."
Monica Geller,Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Monica Geller,"He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!"
Monica Geller,Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Monica Geller,Ohhhh!
Monica Geller,That is so sweet!
Monica Geller,Hey guys!
Monica Geller,"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?"
Monica Geller,"All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!"
Monica Geller,"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,"I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not."
Monica Geller,Rach?
Monica Geller,"You have scratches all over you, what happened?"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,I don't want a cat!
Monica Geller,What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Monica Geller,No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Monica Geller,He's a dropper!
Monica Geller,Oh my-Oh good God!
Monica Geller,"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?"
Monica Geller,"Rach, why won't they take it back?"
Monica Geller,"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close."
Monica Geller,So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Monica Geller,"Why, do you write him a lot?"
Monica Geller,Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Monica Geller,Please! I made this game what it is.
Monica Geller,"All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?"
Monica Geller,"All right! Let's go! Let's go Team Monica! All right, we can work out the name later."
Monica Geller,Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Monica Geller,Wow! You made a profit!
Monica Geller,"All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!"
Monica Geller,"It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!"
Monica Geller,"Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!"
Monica Geller,Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Monica Geller,"Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!"
Monica Geller,It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, remember that great song, Me, Myself, and I?"
Monica Geller,Bye!
Monica Geller,Why are so mad at him?
Monica Geller,"Well, it just seems that..."
Monica Geller,Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. You can go.
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!"
Monica Geller,"No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! Chandler!!!!"
Monica Geller,Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Monica Geller,I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Monica Geller,"A small puff of air, now come on!"
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
Monica Geller,I sure do! And you don't get one!
Monica Geller,They're still in my coat.
Monica Geller,I love you.
Monica Geller,I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Monica Geller,"Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!"
Monica Geller,Chandler! What are you doing here?
Monica Geller,Not even close.
Monica Geller,Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Monica Geller,Sit down.
Monica Geller,Put your head back.
Monica Geller,All right.
Monica Geller,"Now, open your eyes."
Monica Geller,How many fingers am I holding up?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, I was thinking four."
Monica Geller,"Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?"
Monica Geller,No drops!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"On three, 1...2...3! Now my pillow's all wet!"
Monica Geller,Then why did you move?!
Monica Geller,"All right, come here!"
Monica Geller,I am going... I'm going--Turn it over! I'm... I am going to get these drops in your eyes.
Monica Geller,Damn! It's empty!
Monica Geller,Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Monica Geller,What did you do to his sweater vests?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second."
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry."
Monica Geller,Hello?
Monica Geller,"Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!"
Monica Geller,"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?"
Monica Geller,Go!!
Monica Geller,Okay! Okay! Okay! We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe? Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard."
Monica Geller,The Richard.
Monica Geller,"Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?"
Monica Geller,"It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him."
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!"
Monica Geller,Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,It's almost our anniversary!
Monica Geller,I got you a present!
Monica Geller,"I know, but you have to open it today!"
Monica Geller,Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Monica Geller,"For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary."
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!"
Monica Geller,"But we can go, right?"
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,"Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!"
Monica Geller,Aww! I love you!
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,"I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!"
Monica Geller,"Oh that's okay. Don't worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary."
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,Great!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you don't eat animals."
Monica Geller,Who are you talking too?
Monica Geller,I'm so sorry.
Monica Geller,I knew you were not okay with that.
Monica Geller,"It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?"
Monica Geller,You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Monica Geller,"I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you."
Monica Geller,"I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!"
Monica Geller,"Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you."
Monica Geller,Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Monica Geller,No it is not!
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Monica Geller,"This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again."
Monica Geller,Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Monica Geller,Anybody lose this?
Monica Geller,Hmm.
Monica Geller,"All right baby, come on! Yes! Yes! I am on fire!"
Monica Geller,"Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!"
Monica Geller,"What? Wait! Why? Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I'm sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!"
Monica Geller,Not any more.
Monica Geller,"Really! All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. Okay, this is empty."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long."
Monica Geller,We have one.
Monica Geller,A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! Yes!
Monica Geller,"That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?"
Monica Geller,Pick a number! That is your only job!
Monica Geller,Thank you!
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?
Monica Geller,"Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich-Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?"
Monica Geller,Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!
Monica Geller,Shut up!! It just got interesting!
Monica Geller,What did you just say?
Monica Geller,Are you serious?!
Monica Geller,I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,"Nobody move! Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!"
Monica Geller,That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
Monica Geller,I think so too.
Monica Geller,"Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
Monica Geller,You're so efficient. I love you!
Monica Geller,No-no-no! We need something old!
Monica Geller,That'll work!
Monica Geller,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
Monica Geller,That's stealing!
Monica Geller,Ohh.
Monica Geller,"Yep, we wanna get married!"
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,"No, only because that's the graduation song."
Monica Geller,Are you sure you wanna do this?
Monica Geller,Are you sure you wanna do this?
Monica Geller,Whoa!
Monica Geller,What are you guys doing here?
Monica Geller,Why else would we be here?
Monica Geller,This is insane!
Monica Geller,What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore."
Monica Geller,Yes I do!
Monica Geller,"Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon."
Monica Geller,Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
Monica Geller,What are you guys gonna do?
Monica Geller,"So, what do you think we should do?"
Monica Geller,I know I love you!
Monica Geller,"That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!"
Monica Geller,"All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Ready?
Monica Geller,Come on eight.
Monica Geller,Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
Monica Geller,Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Monica Geller,I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
Monica Geller,"Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign."
Monica Geller,That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Monica Geller,He took my snack!
Monica Geller,"Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad."
Monica Geller,"This doesn't mean anything, does it?"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"No, don't say it! Don't even think it!"
Monica Geller,"I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!"
Monica Geller,I don't want things to change! Do you?
Monica Geller,"All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!"
Monica Geller,Then all your stuff would be here.
Monica Geller,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense."
Monica Geller,Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Monica Geller,YES!!!!!!!!
Monica Geller,Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Monica Geller,Here's your key
Monica Geller,"Here's your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!"
Monica Geller,Ready!
Monica Geller,Wait! Oh my God! I can't get out!
Monica Geller,"No, it's not a sign! It's a very old key!"
Monica Geller,Oh my God it's old!
Monica Geller,I love you!
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
Monica Geller,"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it."
Monica Geller,Pretty much.
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Joey, we have something to tell you."
Monica Geller,Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Monica Geller,Hey Pheebs!
Monica Geller,"Hey, have you seen Rachel?"
Monica Geller,I have some pretty exciting news!
Monica Geller,No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together."
Monica Geller,"Okay, come here!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?"
Monica Geller,"Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!"
Monica Geller,"I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here."
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,"Yes, we are."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, he's gonna work on that."
Monica Geller,We'll be waiting for you...
Monica Geller,"Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!"
Monica Geller,I'm not your best friend?
Monica Geller,"All right, all right, at least I'm prepared."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,These aren't for you! Are you upset?
Monica Geller,"Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you."
Monica Geller,"No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before."
Monica Geller,"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together."
Monica Geller,"Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush."
Monica Geller,Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
Monica Geller,"Maybe, do you need a tissue?"
Monica Geller,I made them!
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us."
Monica Geller,"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad."
Monica Geller,"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!"
Monica Geller,"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff."
Monica Geller,"Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore."
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!"
Monica Geller,"I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate."
Monica Geller,Something to remember me by!
Monica Geller,"But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!"
Monica Geller,"I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era."
Monica Geller,"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!"
Monica Geller,What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
Monica Geller,What's hard to believe?
Monica Geller,"Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
Monica Geller,"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, sweetie."
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,I'm gonna miss you!
Monica Geller,I know!
Monica Geller,Who's Denise?
Monica Geller,"Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much."
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no."
Monica Geller,I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Monica Geller,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Monica Geller,Are you mocking me?
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.
Monica Geller,Yeah! Oh yes!
Monica Geller,"Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together."
Monica Geller,Totally!
Monica Geller,Oh good.
Monica Geller,Changes?
Monica Geller,You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Monica Geller,"Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together."
Monica Geller,See now-now you're taking them away from their home.
Monica Geller,"Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!"
Monica Geller,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Monica Geller,"Ross, we can handle this."
Monica Geller,Love is the best medicine.
Monica Geller,Why do you do it?
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,That's very funny!
Monica Geller,"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, no, me neither."
Monica Geller,You still want to move in together right?
Monica Geller,Ross didn't scare you?
Monica Geller,"Come here, I want to show you something!"
Monica Geller,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! I love that!
Monica Geller,"Uh, no!!"
Monica Geller,This bottle opener.
Monica Geller,And it's a magnet!
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, aren't these candlesticks mine?"
Monica Geller,"Ohh! Yeah, I forgot."
Monica Geller,That you're a liar.
Monica Geller,"Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Phoebe that's crazy!
Monica Geller,Hmm?
Monica Geller,"No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself."
Monica Geller,I loved them!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,How'd the lecture go?
Monica Geller,That you're not funny or sexy?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but y'know we could sneak in and watch."
Monica Geller,What the hell are you doing?!
Monica Geller,Monica Gellerrr.
Monica Geller,"Oh, you can have an accent and I can't?! Top 'O the morning to ya laddies!"
Monica Geller,Gimme 'em!
Monica Geller,You stole them from me!
Monica Geller,Gimme them!
Monica Geller,You just wanna each take one?
Monica Geller,"Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you're, y'know, that you're adjusting to life in America."
Monica Geller,I think you look fine.
Monica Geller,"Okay, come on, do it one more time!"
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,You're kidding!
Monica Geller,Ross!
Monica Geller,"Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!"
Monica Geller,"Don't worry about it Phoebe, we'll absolutely do it."
Monica Geller,"Come on Chandler, come on! It'll give us great practice for when--people with babies come to visit."
Monica Geller,"Pheebs, how's it going?"
Monica Geller,"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler."
Monica Geller,What do you mean?
Monica Geller,This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound."
Monica Geller,"I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it."
Monica Geller,And six others.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!"
Monica Geller,Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Monica Geller,How are you still single?!
Monica Geller,Good. What made you change your mind?
Monica Geller,"Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!"
Monica Geller,And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?
Monica Geller,"Joey, you know you don't actually have one."
Monica Geller,"All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room."
Monica Geller,"The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!"
Monica Geller,"He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital."
Monica Geller,Oh my God.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!"
Monica Geller,But my apartment!
Monica Geller,But the mess!
Monica Geller,"You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe."
Monica Geller,It's not your birthday.
Monica Geller,You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Monica Geller,"Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed."
Monica Geller,"Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?"
Monica Geller,You're plans were with us.
Monica Geller,"All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!"
Monica Geller,"Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!"
Monica Geller,"Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with..."
Monica Geller,I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Monica Geller,"Okay fine, now Ross..."
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,"It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?"
Monica Geller,Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Monica Geller,"All right, sorry."
Monica Geller,Oh God!
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,I'm gonna miss you so much.
Monica Geller,I don't think there's anything.
Monica Geller,"Nope, she's perfect."
Monica Geller,"Aw, sometimes. Always, actually."
Monica Geller,Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch."
Monica Geller,"Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!"
Monica Geller,What's up?
Monica Geller,"Oh, put him on!"
Monica Geller,"""Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"""
Monica Geller,"""Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"""
Monica Geller,I'm not talking to her!
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!"
Monica Geller,"Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Monica Geller,Because it's my apartment!
Monica Geller,"How about, you're moving!!"
Monica Geller,I am not!
Monica Geller,No Phoebe I am mad!
Monica Geller,"Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"""
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate."
Monica Geller,"Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots..."
Monica Geller,She lets you borrow them.
Monica Geller,"Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like."
Monica Geller,"When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror."
Monica Geller,"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket."
Monica Geller,"And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!"
Monica Geller,Kinda. Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Monica Geller,I'm really gonna miss you.
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,She really left.
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Can I ask you a question?
Monica Geller,What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, So you can move them!"
Monica Geller,It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Monica Geller,"Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?"
Monica Geller,"Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, so you like her too Chandler?"
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated."
Monica Geller,"Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble."
Monica Geller,"Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt."
Monica Geller,"Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?"
Monica Geller,"So, Phoebe runs weird huh?"
Monica Geller,Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Monica Geller,I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Monica Geller,We'll see.
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight."
Monica Geller,It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Monica Geller,"Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Why is Ross naked?
Monica Geller,Naked?
Monica Geller,Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Monica Geller,"Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!"
Monica Geller,Is it okay for me to come in now?
Monica Geller,Why is everything different?
Monica Geller,"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets."
Monica Geller,"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?"
Monica Geller,"Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that."
Monica Geller,Of course!
Monica Geller,"All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?"
Monica Geller,Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Monica Geller,Hey guys.
Monica Geller,It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way."
Monica Geller,I don't think mine likes me either.
Monica Geller,We should go.
Monica Geller,What happened to your teeth.
Monica Geller,"Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them."
Monica Geller,"Ross they're really, really, really white."
Monica Geller,How much longer?
Monica Geller,Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Monica Geller,She will be after tonight.
Monica Geller,Oh my god.
Monica Geller,"My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, please, come on. Look at him."
Monica Geller,"Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple."
Monica Geller,"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright."
Monica Geller,"I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you."
Monica Geller,Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Monica Geller,Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Monica Geller,"All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see."
Monica Geller,Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
Monica Geller,"Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer."
Monica Geller,"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Monica Geller,"When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip."
Monica Geller,"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter."
Monica Geller,"Okay, great! Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?"
Monica Geller,"I miss Rachel. No, my parents."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four."
Monica Geller,Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
Monica Geller,"Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't."
Monica Geller,So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
Monica Geller,"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch."
Monica Geller,"Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,You really think that'll work?
Monica Geller,I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
Monica Geller,Nothing.
Monica Geller,"No, sweetie, I-I trust you."
Monica Geller,You're not gonna mess it up.
Monica Geller,"Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that."
Monica Geller,Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
Monica Geller,"Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?"
Monica Geller,"You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!"
Monica Geller,"Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!"
Monica Geller,"Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke."
Monica Geller,"Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!"
Monica Geller,"Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
Monica Geller,"Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!"
Monica Geller,You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
Monica Geller,"Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-"
Monica Geller,"Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!"
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Mmmm! It's good!
Monica Geller,"It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross."
Monica Geller,"I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it."
Monica Geller,Ross? Let's go.
Monica Geller,"Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance."
Monica Geller,Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Monica Geller,"And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!"
Monica Geller,Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
Monica Geller,Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Monica Geller,"Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom."
Monica Geller,Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It's about being with the people that you love.
Monica Geller,"Oh, here."
Monica Geller,"Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way."
Monica Geller,Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Monica Geller,We are there!
Monica Geller,What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Monica Geller,We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,'Scuse us
Monica Geller,"Okay, here comes another camera."
Monica Geller,"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day."
Monica Geller,Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Monica Geller,"Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him."
Monica Geller,"Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren't wearing underpants?"
Monica Geller,"Man, this sucks! Y'know if Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who's gonna be the losers then?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school."
Monica Geller,Was it really that good?
Monica Geller,"Okay, let's do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!"
Monica Geller,5 6 7 8!
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,"I know! Hey, you haven't been practising the routine, have you?"
Monica Geller,Me too!
Monica Geller,"Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don't wanna look stupid!"
Monica Geller,"Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?"
Monica Geller,"We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled 'CUT!'"
Monica Geller,"Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit. Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!"
Monica Geller,What? We could do it!
Monica Geller,"I can do it, okay? Come on, let's go."
Monica Geller,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8"
Monica Geller,I can't do it!
Monica Geller,"Honey, we have been through this before!"
Monica Geller,You serious?!
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,I am so glad you said cooks.
Monica Geller,You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Monica Geller,"Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it."
Monica Geller,"It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?"
Monica Geller,I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
Monica Geller,"I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!"
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Monica Geller,"Joey, you don't have too!"
Monica Geller,Tomorrow!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Monica Geller,What happened to Janine?
Monica Geller,Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Monica Geller,What?!! What?
Monica Geller,"Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!"
Monica Geller,"Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner."
Monica Geller,I do not like that woman!
Monica Geller,I am loud!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?"
Monica Geller,I know!!!
Monica Geller,"Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go."
Monica Geller,We owe you?!
Monica Geller,We didn't give you any money!
Monica Geller,Don't worry about it.
Monica Geller,Absolutely!
Monica Geller,Good night!
Monica Geller,"I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!"
Monica Geller,All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
Monica Geller,You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
Monica Geller,What did I tell you about the hall?!
Monica Geller,"Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too."
Monica Geller,"Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,That's it big girl! Come on!
Monica Geller,You'd better run!
Monica Geller,I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Monica Geller,"That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us."
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Well, you tell a lot of jokes!"
Monica Geller,It's only you.
Monica Geller,"So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?"
Monica Geller,"Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?"
Monica Geller,Me neither.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel."
Monica Geller,It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Monica Geller,That's a good idea.
Monica Geller,Do you know what's a bad idea?
Monica Geller,That's right. Did you hear something?
Monica Geller,It's coming from the living room.
Monica Geller,"Hey, you guys."
Monica Geller,"Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple."
Monica Geller,"Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny."
Monica Geller,It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?
Monica Geller,"That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!"
Monica Geller,You start working on that list.
Monica Geller,I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Monica Geller,I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.
Monica Geller,All right.
Monica Geller,"No, thank you."
Monica Geller,"Joey, what are you doing?"
Monica Geller,"Joey, do you work here?"
Monica Geller,"Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?"
Monica Geller,"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?"
Monica Geller,Hah!
Monica Geller,"Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance."
Monica Geller,I am not high maintenance!
Monica Geller,You did!
Monica Geller,Why do I have to decide?
Monica Geller,I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.
Monica Geller,"Okay, Chandler, you go first."
Monica Geller,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?"
Monica Geller,Do you want me to pick you?!
Monica Geller,Continue.
Monica Geller,"All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision."
Monica Geller,"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!"
Monica Geller,"Hi, Chandler. There you are."
Monica Geller,"Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?"
Monica Geller,"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler."
Monica Geller,"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!"
Monica Geller,Ahhh! You are on my list.
Monica Geller,I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend."
Monica Geller,"I pick you, Phoebe."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick."
Monica Geller,I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Monica Geller,I have not been sick in over three years!
Monica Geller,I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
Monica Geller,"I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say."
Monica Geller,Rach?
Monica Geller,You bought a boat?
Monica Geller,"Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me."
Monica Geller,Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Monica Geller,Come on.
Monica Geller,"I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe."
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,"Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed."
Monica Geller,How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Monica Geller,"Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel."
Monica Geller,I'm fine.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I think I'm sick."
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?"
Monica Geller,Come on! I really need your help!
Monica Geller,"Fine, I'll rub it on myself."
Monica Geller,Yeah?
Monica Geller,Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Monica Geller,I can't believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Monica Geller,"Not now, I'm sick!"
Monica Geller,What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Monica Geller,"Okay, if you really wanna have sex..."
Monica Geller,Worked like a charm.
Monica Geller,Is someone there?
Monica Geller,Who? Is that your sister?
Monica Geller,"God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!"
Monica Geller,"Oh no it's not, no it's not. It's a first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna..."
Monica Geller,Joey we know you steal our food.
Monica Geller,"Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?"
Monica Geller,This is my favorite part.
Monica Geller,Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
Monica Geller,Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!"
Monica Geller,Where were your parents?
Monica Geller,Poor thing!
Monica Geller,You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
Monica Geller,Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Monica Geller,"Guys, what's going on?"
Monica Geller,That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Monica Geller,"This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood."
Monica Geller,"Yes, but you are dead inside."
Monica Geller,"Wh-what, why?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this."
Monica Geller,Y'know maybe a little bit!
Monica Geller,Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie!
Monica Geller,Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Monica Geller,Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Monica Geller,"Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you."
Monica Geller,Stop it!
Monica Geller,"I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here."
Monica Geller,"Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me."
Monica Geller,"And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside."
Monica Geller,What is wrong with you?!!!
Monica Geller,"What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!"
Monica Geller,No you robot!!
Monica Geller,"No, I haven't."
Monica Geller,Shhhh!!!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Why did they get divorced?
Monica Geller,"And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure."
Monica Geller,He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,Oh no! What's the matter?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,"Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?"
Monica Geller,"No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!"
Monica Geller,Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Monica Geller,Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
Monica Geller,"You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?"
Monica Geller,"Rach, he's a friend of ours."
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,"Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together."
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,You realize what you are don't you?
Monica Geller,You're his bitch.
Monica Geller,Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Yes!!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down."
Monica Geller,Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
Monica Geller,Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
Monica Geller,Yeah! She's right in there!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! That's great! Oh wow! You're a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! My last Kit-Kat bar!
Monica Geller,Okay!!
Monica Geller,It's not mayonnaise!!
Monica Geller,"Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!"
Monica Geller,"Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?"
Monica Geller,"Well, you're not."
Monica Geller,"Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!"
Monica Geller,"Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?"
Monica Geller,"Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!"
Monica Geller,"It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower."
Monica Geller,Y'know what? You are right?!
Monica Geller,Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!"
Monica Geller,Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Monica Geller,Put it out!!
Monica Geller,Here you go sweetie.
Monica Geller,"But, I put some honey in it."
Monica Geller,"Well, you used to like playing the guitar."
Monica Geller,"I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?"
Monica Geller,"No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac."
Monica Geller,People! People say it! Come here!
Monica Geller,"And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands."
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, no! It's sensual!"
Monica Geller,Okay! Ohhh no!
Monica Geller,I can't promise anything.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, me too."
Monica Geller,Stop it!! That's not funny!!
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal."
Monica Geller,You don't want to know what tonight was.
Monica Geller,"Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time."
Monica Geller,All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
Monica Geller,How many?
Monica Geller,I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Monica Geller,No. He's not a horrible guy.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!"
Monica Geller,Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Monica Geller,I was kidding.
Monica Geller,No! Oyster?
Monica Geller,"Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?"
Monica Geller,It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Monica Geller,Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Monica Geller,Noo!! Okay!!
Monica Geller,"Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?"
Monica Geller,"I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird."
Monica Geller,What if I turn out the lights?
Monica Geller,Chandler?
Monica Geller,That's the couch.
Monica Geller,"I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!"
Monica Geller,Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Monica Geller,Are you okay?
Monica Geller,"Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, ""Can the doctor see me now?"""
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again."
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Why would you do that?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,"There was just one woman, wasn't there?"
Monica Geller,Including me?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Oh, yeah."
Monica Geller,"Yes! Why, did you-you forget to make yours?"
Monica Geller,"Okay. Okay, I can't wait! This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!"
Monica Geller,I'm just so excited to make the presents! Shoot!
Monica Geller,"Sure! Okay, you go first."

Monica Geller,"Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, you ready to open yours?"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?"
Monica Geller,"Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that's what this is about."
Monica Geller,"No! No, she doesn't. Uh Phoebe, what she makes-that's uh-they're sock rabbits. They are completely different-Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn't make it! I'm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we're supposed to make the presents!"
Monica Geller,"No-no, it's not okay! It's not! I mean you were just... You're so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y'know I'm just gonna-I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!"
Monica Geller,"Oops! Y'know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?"
Monica Geller,We have got to wash that!
Monica Geller,"Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?"
Monica Geller,I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Monica Geller,"Oop, your cake is ready!"
Monica Geller,Who the hell are you?!
Monica Geller,The only problem!
Monica Geller,"Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs."
Monica Geller,"I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me."
Monica Geller,The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Monica Geller,You are just the sweetest.
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,"Yeah you will! And, are you kiddin' me?!"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,I am!!
Monica Geller,It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Monica Geller,"Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did."
Monica Geller,You're on the phone!
Monica Geller,Come on!
Monica Geller,"Oh well, it's not so bad."
Monica Geller,Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
Monica Geller,Isn't that mine?
Monica Geller,"Yes, they can stay with us."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?"
Monica Geller,"You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend."
Monica Geller,You dated her!
Monica Geller,"All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!"
Monica Geller,"Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?"
Monica Geller,"I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's."
Monica Geller,"So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much."
Monica Geller,Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Monica Geller,Does that smell bother you?
Monica Geller,"Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it."
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,"Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector."
Monica Geller,So it's okay to date a student.
Monica Geller,"Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents."
Monica Geller,Joey that is so sweet.
Monica Geller,What?! You're going out with her again!
Monica Geller,Joey! You didn't even know her!
Monica Geller,Hey! How's it goin'?
Monica Geller,Yes it has! I made cookies!
Monica Geller,But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Monica Geller,"Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!"
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,What's the charity?
Monica Geller,Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
Monica Geller,"Oh, I like Elizabeth."
Monica Geller,"Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs."
Monica Geller,"Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"Well, uh y'know, our guy works with Chandler and he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser!"
Monica Geller,You're not supposed to look!
Monica Geller,"All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny."
Monica Geller,Our guy's a great dancer!
Monica Geller,Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Monica Geller,Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Monica Geller,"Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you're doing frat guys."
Monica Geller,And slept with the professor.
Monica Geller,Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler's work!
Monica Geller,"Uh, would you stop it with that already?!"
Monica Geller,Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Monica Geller,"All right guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y'know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you."
Monica Geller,In 1981 you were 13!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,We're really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Monica Geller,"You're gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?"
Monica Geller,"Eldad, this is Rachel."
Monica Geller,Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! What are you doing here?!
Monica Geller,No! You can't do that!
Monica Geller,Sit down! We're winning!
Monica Geller,Rachel! Rachel! You haven't touched Eldad's hair!
Monica Geller,"That's right Patrick, bye-bye!"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh My God.
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,"Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce."
Monica Geller,"Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it."
Monica Geller,That's your call.
Monica Geller,"Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos."
Monica Geller,They'r alright.
Monica Geller,"No really, they're OK."
Monica Geller,"Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne."
Monica Geller,I'm outa here.
Monica Geller,"Well, what happened?"
Monica Geller,Was it...
Monica Geller,Ahh! Aren't you dressed yet?
Monica Geller,We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Monica Geller,Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Monica Geller,"Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren't any message you've forgotten to give me are there? Apparently you're not very good at it! I..."
Monica Geller,Y'know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case... Okay...
Monica Geller,You had no right to go out with him.
Monica Geller,You sold me out.
Monica Geller,Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Monica Geller,Did you just flick me?
Monica Geller,Ow! Ow! Ow!
Monica Geller,Fine!
Monica Geller,You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Monica Geller,I think our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
Monica Geller,We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Monica Geller,Ross!!
Monica Geller,How crazy that we'd run into you!
Monica Geller,Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Monica Geller,Ohh!
Monica Geller,"Y'know, it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day, 'cause usually he's got the children's hospital."
Monica Geller,And he's a great brother!
Monica Geller,Ohh!
Monica Geller,Ohh!
Monica Geller,"No, you said the baby creeps you out."
Monica Geller,You said the baby.
Monica Geller,Why would the little girl creep you out?
Monica Geller,What?! Excuse me!
Monica Geller,How was your first day?
Monica Geller,"Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy."
Monica Geller,"No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!"
Monica Geller,Yeah! That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, stop writing about us!"
Monica Geller,"Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, I'll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!"
Monica Geller,Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Monica Geller,Phyllis sees what I'm doing.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six."
Monica Geller,We said six!
Monica Geller,"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would've said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriend's such a wise ass-seven!"""
Monica Geller,Ugh!
Monica Geller,What time?
Monica Geller,Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Great.
Monica Geller,Oh that's great!
Monica Geller,I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
Monica Geller,"Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, I love museums!"
Monica Geller,Soakin' up all the culture.
Monica Geller,Where do you want to start?
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch."
Monica Geller,What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
Monica Geller,"Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, that stuff is..."
Monica Geller,"Hi, honey."
Monica Geller,"What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!"
Monica Geller,Oh no!
Monica Geller,"Oh please, he didn't hear it! He didn't hear it!!"
Monica Geller,NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,Have you seen Chandler?!
Monica Geller,The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard! I know! How bad is this?!
Monica Geller,I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
Monica Geller,"Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure! ""Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""
Monica Geller,Well Rachel's not here!
Monica Geller,"I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out."
Monica Geller,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel..."
Monica Geller,"It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't."
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,I know! I know.
Monica Geller,I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
Monica Geller,Still crying?
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex."
Monica Geller,"I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking."
Monica Geller,"Oh, we have some..."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,What's the big deal?
Monica Geller,"Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?"
Monica Geller,Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Monica Geller,Hi guys.
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank you! What's going on?"
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,Are you okay?
Monica Geller,"Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?"
Monica Geller,Are you sure you're okay?
Monica Geller,Ohh that's sweet!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Richard."
Monica Geller,"Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, it's good to see you!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?"
Monica Geller,It's good to see you
Monica Geller,"And so, we're hiding in the bathroom."
Monica Geller,So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Monica Geller,Ohh.
Monica Geller,I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Monica Geller,"Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!"
Monica Geller,Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
Monica Geller,If the school finds out you're fired.
Monica Geller,She's leaving for three months.
Monica Geller,"Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, ""Do you see a future?"" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!"
Monica Geller,Okay well I think...that's your answer.
Monica Geller,Why do you want to see my hand?
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Monica Geller,Hi guys!
Monica Geller,What are you up too?
Monica Geller,Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Monica Geller,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Monica Geller,Okay well that's good to know.
Monica Geller,"Sure, I love this part!"
Monica Geller,Richard!
Monica Geller,"Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?"
Monica Geller,What uh-What did you-What?!
Monica Geller,Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
Monica Geller,Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
Monica Geller,What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Monica Geller,What were you doing in Africa?
Monica Geller,"Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen."
Monica Geller,"Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!"
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Why? Because of the government.
Monica Geller,"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but that's pigs not people!"
Monica Geller,Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Monica Geller,Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Monica Geller,Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it's great."
Monica Geller,I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
Monica Geller,"It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!"
Monica Geller,No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
Monica Geller,I didn't change!
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Is that some kind of boat talk?
Monica Geller,What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica Geller,Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
Monica Geller,Yeah! Richard!
Monica Geller,That's right.
Monica Geller,You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,I don't know why I'm here.
Monica Geller,I don't know.
Monica Geller,Chandler is such an idiot!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'll have a scotch..."
Monica Geller,Still smoking cigars?
Monica Geller,"No that's, that's okay."
Monica Geller,"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago."
Monica Geller,Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
Monica Geller,Edward Nevski?
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Monica Geller,"I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!"
Monica Geller,Oh! Him.
Monica Geller,"I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!"
Monica Geller,"Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!"
Monica Geller,Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can..."
Monica Geller,You wanted it to be a surprise.
Monica Geller,Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Monica Geller,Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Monica Geller,Oh...
Monica Geller,I'm engaged!!!!!! I'm engaged!!!!
Monica Geller,"I'm getting married!!!! I'm gonna be a bride!!!! No, I will not shut up because I'm engaged! Ohh, big talk! Huh, why don't you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20!"
Monica Geller,"Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh! Okay, umm, I just wanna say that...I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. Our special night. I mean it just wouldn't be my-our-our night, if you all weren't here to celebrate with me-us-Damnit!"
Monica Geller,"Awww, come on-wait-stop it. Okay, to Monica."
Monica Geller,Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Monica Geller,"Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!"
Monica Geller,Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but I don't think we have time."
Monica Geller,Let's do it!
Monica Geller,"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!"
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
Monica Geller,"No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding."
Monica Geller,"Fair enough, now go get ready!"
Monica Geller,"I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past."
Monica Geller,"Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?"
Monica Geller,"See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that."
Monica Geller,No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
Monica Geller,"See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!"
Monica Geller,That's true.
Monica Geller,Thunder being stolen!!
Monica Geller,"Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?"
Monica Geller,Yes that would be lovely.
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza."
Monica Geller,"No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you."
Monica Geller,"I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical."
Monica Geller,Paris?
Monica Geller,Keep talking.
Monica Geller,I love you!
Monica Geller,"Bonjour, monsieur."
Monica Geller,"Hi Pheebs, what's up?"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,"Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder."
Monica Geller,"My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie."
Monica Geller,It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
Monica Geller,We had a characturist!
Monica Geller,"And yet, here we are doing it again."
Monica Geller,Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Monica Geller,I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Monica Geller,"Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!"
Monica Geller,"I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!"
Monica Geller,I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Monica Geller,"It's Monica, open up!"
Monica Geller,"I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!"
Monica Geller,I know why!
Monica Geller,Okay! Why?!
Monica Geller,What do you mean?
Monica Geller,I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
Monica Geller,Oww!
Monica Geller,"I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?"
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,"This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage."
Monica Geller,"All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music."
Monica Geller,"All right umm, a string quartet for the procession."
Monica Geller,"A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding."
Monica Geller,"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!"
Monica Geller,Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Monica Geller,Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! It's like one mind.
Monica Geller,"Oh dad, really you don't need to..."
Monica Geller,"Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party."
Monica Geller,"Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?"
Monica Geller,What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
Monica Geller,I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Monica Geller,You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Monica Geller,What about when I started dating Chandler?
Monica Geller,I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Monica Geller,I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Monica Geller,My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Monica Geller,No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Monica Geller,How? I don't have any money.
Monica Geller,How much?
Monica Geller,Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Monica Geller,It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
Monica Geller,"How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!"
Monica Geller,"Ah, yeah!"
Monica Geller,This is the most special day of our lives.
Monica Geller,"Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once."
Monica Geller,You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
Monica Geller,"Eh, you work for that."
Monica Geller,You do?!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
Monica Geller,You thought about that?
Monica Geller,How many kids were we gonna have?
Monica Geller,What else did you think about?
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
Monica Geller,"No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage."
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.
Monica Geller,"I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right."
Monica Geller,Oh good.
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy."
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Of course!
Monica Geller,"If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I already have one."
Monica Geller,"Hey, I know I what I want!"
Monica Geller,"No, you don't want this. I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe."
Monica Geller,"Uh-huh, yeah."
Monica Geller,I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Monica Geller,Okay. I'm gonna be the mom that makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Monica Geller,"Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Wow! That's great! Dad must really like you, he doesn't ask just anyone to play."
Monica Geller,"This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week."
Monica Geller,"Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win."
Monica Geller,He hates to lose.
Monica Geller,What's wrong Phoebe?
Monica Geller,No!! Why didn't you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Monica Geller,This is what happens when you don't register for gifts!
Monica Geller,No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Monica Geller,Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Monica Geller,"All right, I definitely taste nutmeg."
Monica Geller,"You don't? Well, that's the difference between a professional and a layman."
Monica Geller,Hey! How was sailing?
Monica Geller,No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Monica Geller,Hey! How was it?
Monica Geller,Oh my God Chandler! I can't believe it!
Monica Geller,You gave my father a lap dance!
Monica Geller,"Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!"
Monica Geller,I wasn't escaping.
Monica Geller,I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Monica Geller,"Come on. Hello? I'm sorry you have the wrong number. Okay, I'll call you later dad. I love you."
Monica Geller,"Okay, here's batch 22. Ohh, maybe these'll taste a little like your grandmother's. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg."
Monica Geller,"Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade."
Monica Geller,"No, just a Friday night."
Monica Geller,The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Monica Geller,"Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right."
Monica Geller,"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother's? Wouldn't they have the recipe?"
Monica Geller,What was her name?
Monica Geller,Nestle Tollhouse?!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, is this the recipe?"
Monica Geller,I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Monica Geller,"Hello? Hold on please. Joey, it's your mom."
Monica Geller,Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Monica Geller,And I have costumes.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's great!!"
Monica Geller,Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Monica Geller,I'm so happy for you!
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Oooh!
Monica Geller,Ahhh!!
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie.
Monica Geller,I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Monica Geller,Awww. But still no.
Monica Geller,"Really? Okay, so why don't you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?"
Monica Geller,"If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Oh my God. He threw up?
Monica Geller,"Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe's old massage place is getting fired."
Monica Geller,That's right! You lose sucker!! Please still marry me.
Monica Geller,"Hey! Good, you're home!"
Monica Geller,Hey baby.
Monica Geller,I made you a surprise.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I've had such a craving for them."
Monica Geller,Ross!
Monica Geller,No! No. They're umm... They're just uh...ground beef smileys.
Monica Geller,Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Monica Geller,I'm not laughing.
Monica Geller,"You're right. I mean I'm sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!"
Monica Geller,What happened in Atlantic City?!
Monica Geller,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,I-I already told him everything! You shush!!
Monica Geller,Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Monica Geller,It's hard for some people!
Monica Geller,Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Monica Geller,"Ohh, I'm sorry I couldn't think of anymore for Ross!"
Monica Geller,"Y'know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue."
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! What are you laughing at Pampers?
Monica Geller,Yeah?
Monica Geller,"Ohh, absolutely."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, definitely!"
Monica Geller,"Then, I'd steer clear of Phoebe."
Monica Geller,What's the matter?
Monica Geller,"Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us."
Monica Geller,"That's not true, there are great pictures of us!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, here's a great one."
Monica Geller,"I know, but look at me all tan."
Monica Geller,That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know...
Monica Geller,Chandler what do you say?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile."
Monica Geller,"Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy."
Monica Geller,Or not.
Monica Geller,"I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married,"" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!"" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!"
Monica Geller,That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
Monica Geller,"They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is."
Monica Geller,Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Monica Geller,Hey! There you are!
Monica Geller,Are you okay?
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, what were you thinking?"
Monica Geller,Chandler?
Monica Geller,Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we really do!"
Monica Geller,Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Monica Geller,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor."
Monica Geller,"First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me..."
Monica Geller,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine..."
Monica Geller,If Phoebe were my maid of honor...
Monica Geller,"Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset."
Monica Geller,"Well that's the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!"
Monica Geller,Because then I don't have to!
Monica Geller,I'm really not deciding!
Monica Geller,Yeah that's right.
Monica Geller,"Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she...she wished me good luck."
Monica Geller,"No, it's more like a good luck."
Monica Geller,"She was like 30, dark hair, attractive."
Monica Geller,"Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?"
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Monica Geller,Did you break up with her?
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,Fat?!
Monica Geller,You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Monica Geller,"Well, apparently she does."
Monica Geller,Chandler! Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Monica Geller,You're Lewis Posin.
Monica Geller,"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?"
Monica Geller,"No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa.... And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y'know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie."
Monica Geller,"No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me."
Monica Geller,It's pretty clear.
Monica Geller,Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
Monica Geller,"All right, I...I have to ask."
Monica Geller,Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Monica Geller,"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?"
Monica Geller,In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.
Monica Geller,"Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat."
Monica Geller,How?
Monica Geller,"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!"
Monica Geller,Keep going.
Monica Geller,Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Monica Geller,I love you.
Monica Geller,"Hey, what's going on?"
Monica Geller,"Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!"
Monica Geller,She sent the chicken back again?!
Monica Geller,Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Monica Geller,Lucky bastard! Janice.
Monica Geller,I'm fine.
Monica Geller,Oh... Uh...
Monica Geller,"Well, she saw the ring."
Monica Geller,"Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people."
Monica Geller,"Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too."
Monica Geller,Huh?
Monica Geller,"Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!"
Monica Geller,Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!"
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,So-so you would've just lied?
Monica Geller,Would it really have been that easy?
Monica Geller,"Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark."
Monica Geller,He might still show up.
Monica Geller,Is that all?
Monica Geller,It's actually going to be just family.
Monica Geller,What are we gonna do?
Monica Geller,"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?"
Monica Geller,Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom."
Monica Geller,We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
Monica Geller,Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Monica Geller,I never stop thinking about it.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Monica Geller,Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Monica Geller,That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Monica Geller,"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can."
Monica Geller,"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose."
Monica Geller,Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Monica Geller,'Cause you invited your assistant.
Monica Geller,Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Monica Geller,"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do."
Monica Geller,"All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?"
Monica Geller,"Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?"
Monica Geller,Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Monica Geller,Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Monica Geller,That's my pie!
Monica Geller,Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Monica Geller,"We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!"
Monica Geller,Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Monica Geller,I'll be right there!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!"
Monica Geller,"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?"
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,Don't do what?
Monica Geller,1250.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Monica Geller,"When it's your assistant, I would say never."
Monica Geller,"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend."
Monica Geller,"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now."
Monica Geller,Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Monica Geller,"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!"
Monica Geller,That's not gonna work.
Monica Geller,Hey! I didn't know either.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I knew."
Monica Geller,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!"
Monica Geller,"Hi, honey."
Monica Geller,"What? Why, why would..."
Monica Geller,"That's right, she came back all by herself."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent."
Monica Geller,Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Monica Geller,Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Monica Geller,I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Monica Geller,See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Monica Geller,Where you can make out with your assistant.
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, what's the plan?"
Monica Geller,Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Monica Geller,Did you two...
Monica Geller,"Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire..."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!"
Monica Geller,Joey!!
Monica Geller,Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Monica Geller,They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
Monica Geller,Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Monica Geller,Who is that?!
Monica Geller,Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Monica Geller,Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Monica Geller,"Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning."
Monica Geller,Um-hmm.
Monica Geller,"Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute."
Monica Geller,"Umm, can we see you ride it?"
Monica Geller,"See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!"
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules."
Monica Geller,"No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?"
Monica Geller,"Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever."
Monica Geller,"All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!"
Monica Geller,It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
Monica Geller,Hmm?
Monica Geller,But they like it!
Monica Geller,Maybe.
Monica Geller,"Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?"
Monica Geller,"Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!"
Monica Geller,No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
Monica Geller,"Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!"
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Did you smoke?
Monica Geller,"I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door."
Monica Geller,Betrothed...
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Licorice?
Monica Geller,Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,About a half an hour.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Bing's weird.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you."
Monica Geller,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does."
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing."
Monica Geller,You need to give him money.
Monica Geller,"No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin' you down. Everybody wants to be paid off."
Monica Geller,You've got to be smooth about it.
Monica Geller,How did it go?
Monica Geller,"It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!"
Monica Geller,I don't know.
Monica Geller,We'd be eating our soup right now.
Monica Geller,"Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!"
Monica Geller,"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?"
Monica Geller,"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?"
Monica Geller,"Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas."
Monica Geller,Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Monica Geller,Come on Ben.
Monica Geller,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say."
Monica Geller,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?"
Monica Geller,"Yes, is that okay?"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,You were invited?!
Monica Geller,"My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too."
Monica Geller,"Joey, that paper's like a year old!"
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
Monica Geller,"Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!"
Monica Geller,Joan?
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got ""and guest?!"""
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!"
Monica Geller,Why not?!
Monica Geller,"Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me."
Monica Geller,We'll see.
Monica Geller,David who?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?"
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,So! He'll understand!
Monica Geller,"God, you are so strong."
Monica Geller,Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
Monica Geller,I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Monica Geller,Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Monica Geller,"So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, you're fine."
Monica Geller,"Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?"
Monica Geller,Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Monica Geller,Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Monica Geller,"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!"
Monica Geller,Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Monica Geller,"Ross, when's this comet thing start?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, we've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly."
Monica Geller,She's sleeping.
Monica Geller,"Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up."
Monica Geller,It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Monica Geller,With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Monica Geller,"Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway."
Monica Geller,Okay that does sound like fun.
Monica Geller,The second sister dies?!
Monica Geller,The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Monica Geller,"Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?"
Monica Geller,Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Monica Geller,Are you still awake?
Monica Geller,You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up...
Monica Geller,What?! What are you doing?!
Monica Geller,Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Monica Geller,"Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!"
Monica Geller,Give me the good stuff.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm up! I'm up!"
Monica Geller,That really was some of your best work.
Monica Geller,I have to be up in seven minutes.
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
Monica Geller,"Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section..."
Monica Geller,Look at this.
Monica Geller,I can't believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Monica Geller,"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down."
Monica Geller,"Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!"
Monica Geller,As much as they love you?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,That was me and Ross.
Monica Geller,Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's okay, I can't wait to see everything again! All of the memories..."
Monica Geller,I used to love to play restaurant.
Monica Geller,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!"
Monica Geller,Hey guys! Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days."
Monica Geller,"Okay. So, which boxes are mine?"
Monica Geller,Okay. Oh! A coloring book!
Monica Geller,Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Monica Geller,"Oh, an old glove?"
Monica Geller,"Wow! Look At This! I Can'T Believe I Even Fit Into This Shirt! Oh, this is yours."
Monica Geller,"This isn't mine. Hey, this isn't, this isn't my stuff! Ugh, Ross! These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Just mine?
Monica Geller,So why-why wasn't Ross's stuff ruined? And if you say the words medical marvel I'm going to Easy Bake your head!
Monica Geller,"So wait, Ross's stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!"
Monica Geller,I can't believe this!
Monica Geller,"Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this. It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and I don't even know what it is! Ohh, it's still soft. What do you think this is?"
Monica Geller,How do you think I am?! You've wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Monica Geller,What's this?
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Wait, you're giving me your Porsche, you're kidding me right?!"
Monica Geller,All right!
Monica Geller,Hey guys!
Monica Geller,Do you guys know what happened to Chandler's barca lounger?
Monica Geller,Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger's gone?! This is the best day ever!
Monica Geller,Happy birthday!!!
Monica Geller,It's your birthday!
Monica Geller,Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Monica Geller,They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Monica Geller,"Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends..."
Monica Geller,"Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross."
Monica Geller,I can't believe you bought this.
Monica Geller,"All right Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great. I mean y'know let's face it, no one handles this well."
Monica Geller,Weren't you asked to leave sonny?
Monica Geller,Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Monica Geller,"Nooo! Okay. Whoa! Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning thirty. So the bus boys took me out for some drinks. I wanna puke on you later!"
Monica Geller,Noo!!!
Monica Geller,Noo!!
Monica Geller,Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! That they know of.
Monica Geller,Really?! You promise?
Monica Geller,Okay. I love you so much.
Monica Geller,What about your breath?!
Monica Geller,Okay. I can do that.
Monica Geller,"Ross, just forget about it. This guy's got you totally wedged in."
Monica Geller,Yay!
Monica Geller,Paul!
Monica Geller,Phil!
Monica Geller,Awwwww...
Monica Geller,All you had to do was buy the card!
Monica Geller,"Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!"
Monica Geller,"You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!"
Monica Geller,I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...
Monica Geller,"I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?"
Monica Geller,Oh man!
Monica Geller,He's gonna eat the cake!
Monica Geller,"I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony."
Monica Geller,"Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony."
Monica Geller,"Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading."
Monica Geller,Do you mind telling us what it is?
Monica Geller,What is DOOL?
Monica Geller,Who are they killing off?
Monica Geller,Noo!!
Monica Geller,She's my favorite character on DOOL.
Monica Geller,And the way she slaps all the time!
Monica Geller,Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
Monica Geller,What is that?
Monica Geller,It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Nooo!!
Monica Geller,"No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!"
Monica Geller,"He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!"
Monica Geller,Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
Monica Geller,No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Monica Geller,You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?"
Monica Geller,Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
Monica Geller,"Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch."
Monica Geller,Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
Monica Geller,What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Monica Geller,Come on! It wasn't that bad!
Monica Geller,"All right, what about the third guy?"
Monica Geller,Can you blame him?
Monica Geller,Well then we still have a problem.
Monica Geller,"Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they're all either boring or annoying or y'know, can't stop staring at the ladies."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, we're getting married, married; not sixth grade married."
Monica Geller,Are you serious?
Monica Geller,We're never gonna find anybody.
Monica Geller,Joey look it's really sweet...
Monica Geller,That is true.
Monica Geller,It might be kinda cool.
Monica Geller,"Hey Pheebs, how's it going?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you something?"
Monica Geller,"Here, take a couple of these."
Monica Geller,It's Hexadrin.
Monica Geller,"Okay, while we're waiting for these pills to kick in, I'm gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I'm gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I'm-Sit down--gonna make you some tea. And then, I'm gonna rub your feet."
Monica Geller,Hexadrin.
Monica Geller,"No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff."
Monica Geller,"Y'know, the possible side affects."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!"
Monica Geller,In case it happens.
Monica Geller,You did it! You got ordained?!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, your liver is right here."
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!"
Monica Geller,How about receiving?
Monica Geller,"I gotcha. Sorry. So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?"
Monica Geller,It doesn't say that!
Monica Geller,There you go!
Monica Geller,"No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom."
Monica Geller,"And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much..."
Monica Geller,Cute PJ's! You're really livin' it up here in London huh?
Monica Geller,Is Joey here?
Monica Geller,Wouldn't you be?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Well, not anymore."
Monica Geller,"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
Monica Geller,Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Y'know what's weird?
Monica Geller,This doesn't feel weird!
Monica Geller,You're a really good kisser.
Monica Geller,Hm-hmm!
Monica Geller,Wow! You are really fast!
Monica Geller,We're gonna see each other naked.
Monica Geller,Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Monica Geller,One!
Monica Geller,Two!
Monica Geller,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me."
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey."
Monica Geller,No because it-it didn't seem important.
Monica Geller,Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Monica Geller,"Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!"
Monica Geller,"Wait Chandler come on, let's-it's not a big deal!"
Monica Geller,Hey-hey.
Monica Geller,Yeah baby!

Monica Geller,Your favorite!
Monica Geller,Yep! And lot's of it!
Monica Geller,"Okay, in we go."
Monica Geller,So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Monica Geller,Chandler.

Monica Geller,"No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job."
Monica Geller,There were only twelve.
Monica Geller,What are peanut butter fingers?!
Monica Geller,"This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can't believe I found it!"
Monica Geller,"Well I'm Monica Geller, ball like a baby."

Monica Geller,The best man? Wow!
Monica Geller,"Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings."
Monica Geller,"All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you're looking for! Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running."
Monica Geller,All right.

Monica Geller,What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Monica Geller,How?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work."
Monica Geller,"Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go."
Monica Geller,Oh crap!
Monica Geller,Don't come in here!
Monica Geller,No! We only mess around at his place!
Monica Geller,"No, I'm wearing a wedding dress."
Monica Geller,Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
Monica Geller,"Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it."
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings."
Monica Geller,"Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little."
Monica Geller,Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
Monica Geller,All right? What's going on?
Monica Geller,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
Monica Geller,Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Monica Geller,Honey? Is that something you're making up?
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll go!"
Monica Geller,"Really? My God, he's really cute."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, I'm engaged!"
Monica Geller,"Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged."
Monica Geller,Well you should be embarrassed.
Monica Geller,Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
Monica Geller,"Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly."
Monica Geller,And did he?
Monica Geller,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?"
Monica Geller,"No, a guy would be saying, ""I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."" Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I...I'm never gonna have a first kiss again."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling..."
Monica Geller,"See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?"
Monica Geller,Have you seen Chandler?
Monica Geller,'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Monica Geller,Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Monica Geller,So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Monica Geller,Your mother told you this?
Monica Geller,The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Monica Geller,"Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?"
Monica Geller,You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Monica Geller,Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
Monica Geller,"Just, I love you so much. Just...It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?"
Monica Geller,Even with me?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid..."
Monica Geller,What was it for?
Monica Geller,Wow!
Monica Geller,Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Monica Geller,"Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?"
Monica Geller,"I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days."
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.
Monica Geller,"Ross, she's 25 years old."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Subtle guys!
Monica Geller,I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Monica Geller,Okay. Sorry.
Monica Geller,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Monica Geller,That's what you say about porn.
Monica Geller,No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Monica Geller,"Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Oh boy me too!
Monica Geller,Yeah?
Monica Geller,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!"
Monica Geller,"Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch."
Monica Geller,Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Monica Geller,"So, are you ready to go?"
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Monica Geller,Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
Monica Geller,You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Monica Geller,She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Monica Geller,Wafer thin ice!
Monica Geller,So to get this part you can't be?
Monica Geller,But you are?
Monica Geller,But you told them you weren't?
Monica Geller,Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
Monica Geller,Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!"
Monica Geller,Unless!
Monica Geller,"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion."
Monica Geller,"Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?"
Monica Geller,"Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work."
Monica Geller,"No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys."
Monica Geller,I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Monica Geller,"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on."
Monica Geller,"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna."
Monica Geller,"Oh, just until the glue dries."
Monica Geller,"Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable."
Monica Geller,"Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink."
Monica Geller,"I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work."
Monica Geller,Toothpick?
Monica Geller,What are you trying on now?
Monica Geller,And?
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,What?! Which one?!
Monica Geller,Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
Monica Geller,For what?
Monica Geller,You al-you already had it?
Monica Geller,"Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best."
Monica Geller,"Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!"
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you..."
Monica Geller,Wow!
Monica Geller,They were lovers.
Monica Geller,"Okay so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is. And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are."
Monica Geller,"Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?"
Monica Geller,"Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens."
Monica Geller,Why would they think they're invited?
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,Ross's parents are my parents!
Monica Geller,"Oh please, you just want more blue pins."
Monica Geller,"All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!"
Monica Geller,"Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!"
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad."
Monica Geller,Oh Joey!
Monica Geller,No she hasn't.
Monica Geller,"Well, what am I going to say?"
Monica Geller,"Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! T-Tell me about it! Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! What are they Irish?!"
Monica Geller,"Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time."
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Monica Geller,007 has a fancy car!
Monica Geller,007 gets all the ladies.
Monica Geller,How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I'll make you a nice martini.
Monica Geller,How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,The show?!
Monica Geller,Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Monica Geller,The wedding starts at six.
Monica Geller,You'll vamp?!
Monica Geller,You just carry that around?
Monica Geller,Between you and...
Monica Geller,A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Monica Geller,"All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!"
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Monica Geller,There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Monica Geller,"Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding."
Monica Geller,No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
Monica Geller,Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
Monica Geller,You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Monica Geller,"Hi, I'm Ross's little sister."
Monica Geller,Ennnh.
Monica Geller,"Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!"
Monica Geller,"Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!"
Monica Geller,It's kind of an important one!
Monica Geller,"All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 ...7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!"
Monica Geller,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Monica Geller,Oh yeah? When?
Monica Geller,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica Geller,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
Monica Geller,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Monica Geller,Well?
Monica Geller,Do you think he knew I was here?
Monica Geller,"Wait, wait, wait!"
Monica Geller,Look!
Monica Geller,I bet this will work!
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Monica Geller,"Yes, you did!"
Monica Geller,You love me!
Monica Geller,Then all your stuff would be here.
Monica Geller,"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense."
Monica Geller,You wanted it to be a surprise.
Monica Geller,Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
Monica Geller,Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Monica Geller,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!"
Monica Geller,"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell."
Monica Geller,I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Monica Geller,"Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big..."
Monica Geller,Bye!
Monica Geller,"Actually, I did!"
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!"
Monica Geller,Them?! Who's them?
Monica Geller,Joey!
Monica Geller,"Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So..."
Monica Geller,She's bluffing!
Monica Geller,You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Monica Geller,Of course.
Monica Geller,I love you too Chandler.
Monica Geller,"Well actually, Ross doesn't."
Monica Geller,"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
Monica Geller,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, you guys!"
Monica Geller,Oh that's so sweet.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine."
Monica Geller,Chandler!!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, well he's my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it."
Monica Geller,Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Monica Geller,"Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, ""You can drive it, but don't tell Rachel"" plan!"
Monica Geller,"Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver. There! That wasn't about the wedding."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad."
Monica Geller,Chandler! He's your father; he should be at the wedding.
Monica Geller,Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!
Monica Geller,So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.
Monica Geller,Here!
Monica Geller,It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Monica Geller,"We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law."
Monica Geller,"No you didn't. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know..."
Monica Geller,"Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad."
Monica Geller,Who's Mr. Girabaldi?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life."
Monica Geller,Yes!
Monica Geller,How much did ever really win before?
Monica Geller,I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Monica Geller,Why not?!
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,That can't be your father.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Relax! You'll be fine. Oh much better. You're invisible now.
Monica Geller,"Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter-Uh, tress!"
Monica Geller,I'm-I'm Monica.
Monica Geller,New York.
Monica Geller,In...in two weeks.
Monica Geller,You okay?
Monica Geller,Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Monica Geller,Old?
Monica Geller,That's much better.
Monica Geller,We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
Monica Geller,"I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared."
Monica Geller,"Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue."
Monica Geller,I had to go with the odds Rach.
Monica Geller,That other play?
Monica Geller,Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!
Monica Geller,Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!
Monica Geller,Who did we fight in World War I?
Monica Geller,"Honey, we gotta go!"
Monica Geller,"I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does."
Monica Geller,"Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?"
Monica Geller,"I just, I can't believe that we made it!"
Monica Geller,I'm sorry but...nothing.
Monica Geller,"Well...honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out."
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Ohh, I'm so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it's really, it's made me stay calm. I coulda been worse!"
Monica Geller,"Hi! If you're calling before Saturday, you've reached Monica and Chandler. But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing! Please leave a message for the Bings!"
Monica Geller,"Hey Maureen! Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen."
Monica Geller,What is that?
Monica Geller,"Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller."
Monica Geller,"Dad! There's Ross , why don't you go talk to him?"
Monica Geller,Hi Mr....Bing.
Monica Geller,It-it's so great to see you both here.
Monica Geller,"Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?"
Monica Geller,He is the man in the black dress.
Monica Geller,"All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?"
Monica Geller,Who wants it? Anybody?
Monica Geller,"Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself."
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely."
Monica Geller,Okay. Sorry.
Monica Geller,I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
Monica Geller,I'm gonna start getting ready!
Monica Geller,"Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair."
Monica Geller,About what?
Monica Geller,"Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?"
Monica Geller,Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Monica Geller,Rachel! You okay?
Monica Geller,"The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!"

Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,I can't go to lunch!!
Monica Geller,What's going on?
Monica Geller,"Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out."
Monica Geller,"How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!"
Monica Geller,"Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, ""Oh my God! The worst has happened!"""
Monica Geller,I wanna wear this everyday.
Monica Geller,I'm so happy for me.
Monica Geller,"I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?"
Monica Geller,Are you okay?
Monica Geller,"Well, you're-you're sweating."
Monica Geller,Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
Monica Geller,She's right there.
Monica Geller,Not now.
Monica Geller,Who is this?
Monica Geller,He took off?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!"
Monica Geller,I do.
Monica Geller,What baby?
Monica Geller,We have a baby?
Monica Geller,I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Guys! I'm not pregnant.
Monica Geller,You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
Monica Geller,"Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party."
Monica Geller,Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.
Monica Geller,Because I'm not.
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Why?!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us."
Monica Geller,"Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Oh that is so sweet!
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,What's the matter?
Monica Geller,"Well, are you going to be able to do this?"
Monica Geller,"Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us."
Monica Geller,Oh sweet Lord.
Monica Geller,"Honey, I'm not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!"
Monica Geller,Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Monica Geller,This is so huge.
Monica Geller,Of course not nothing is. Between me and you...
Monica Geller,...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Monica Geller,How?
Monica Geller,"Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own."
Monica Geller,Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
Monica Geller,"Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?"
Monica Geller,Are you okay?
Monica Geller,Oh really?!
Monica Geller,Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
Monica Geller,How do you feel?
Monica Geller,Yes! Maybe it's a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
Monica Geller,"You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present."
Monica Geller,"Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?"
Monica Geller,"Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine."
Monica Geller,"Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go."
Monica Geller,"Did I miss it? Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it's positive, we're gonna..."
Monica Geller,Go ahead Rach.
Monica Geller,"Well... Well, great."
Monica Geller,Oh God...
Monica Geller,Are you really gonna do this?
Monica Geller,"That's right. I'm no longer a bride. I'll never be a bride again. Now, I'm just someone's wife!"
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, right."
Monica Geller,That's not 'til Thursday.
Monica Geller,They won't be ready for weeks.
Monica Geller,That's true! I knew I married you for a reason!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Monica Geller,"Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"No! But, they're callin' out to me! I mean this little guy even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?"
Monica Geller,A tiny salt shaker!!!
Monica Geller,Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Monica Geller,"Good. Okay, I'm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them."
Monica Geller,"Whew. Although y'know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean... I guess y'know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?"
Monica Geller,Or this one!
Monica Geller,"Hey, how are you feelin'? Any morning sickness?"
Monica Geller,No! Joey and Ross don't know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe's pregnant.
Monica Geller,"Wow. Y'know it is so weird. I mean, you're gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what's gonna happen."
Monica Geller,What was that bam?
Monica Geller,Who's David Lynn?
Monica Geller,"No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?"
Monica Geller,Give me one more.
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Joey!
Monica Geller,You can't marry him!
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
Monica Geller,Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn't have a baby in nine months!
Monica Geller,There's a dude?
Monica Geller,People have got to finish their stories!
Monica Geller,I don't know how any of these got opened?!
Monica Geller,"I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!"
Monica Geller,Yeah. What is that?
Monica Geller,Hey! How'd it go?
Monica Geller,So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Great! We're hangin' in the kitchen! Let's stay in the kitchen!
Monica Geller,Wow! That is a great picture!
Monica Geller,Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
Monica Geller,That would be a good idea.
Monica Geller,You kissed another woman!
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!!
Monica Geller,Yeah I am!
Monica Geller,That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.
Monica Geller,"Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn't find though was your Speedo."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,This is so great! And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood."
Monica Geller,"Well, what were you gonna say?"
Monica Geller,Hey! Good luck!
Monica Geller,"Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby."
Monica Geller,I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
Monica Geller,They're kissing let's just go around them.
Monica Geller,I'm in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
Monica Geller,"Hi! Can you do that and walk? 'Cause she said, ""Next."""
Monica Geller,Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
Monica Geller,Grab my ass!
Monica Geller,"Hi, sorry. I almost didn't hear you, because y'know I'm just so in love with my new husband. We're on our honeymoon."
Monica Geller,"Oh no, you see we're on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?"
Monica Geller,"You see, if we'd gone around them like I said, we-She would've given us those tickets. Damnit!"
Monica Geller,Look at that! Look at that! They're going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
Monica Geller,Me neither! We have to get in!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Oranges!
Monica Geller,Fine. Go! Go! Go!
Monica Geller,I can't believe we're here.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Monica Geller,Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Monica Geller,What? Are you serious?! Joey smells gas!
Monica Geller,Well do something! Get in there!
Monica Geller,Yeah! Do that!
Monica Geller,No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!
Monica Geller,You're really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
Monica Geller,Hi sweetie!
Monica Geller,"Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back."
Monica Geller,"No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call."
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Monica Geller,We didn't get anything for anyone.
Monica Geller,That you can have.
Monica Geller,It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you're having a baby!
Monica Geller,Oh great!
Monica Geller,"All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y'know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?"
Monica Geller,Do you still wanna call 'em? I wanna call 'em.
Monica Geller,Hello? Eighth street deli?
Monica Geller,"Uh sorry, wrong number."
Monica Geller,Hello? It's the deli again!
Monica Geller,I don't think this number's right!
Monica Geller,What?! People don't do that!
Monica Geller,They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Monica Geller,"And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, definitely."
Monica Geller,I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Monica Geller,"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names."
Monica Geller,"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
Monica Geller,Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
Monica Geller,What about my questions?
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Was that another joke?"
Monica Geller,Hell yeah!!!
Monica Geller,Sweetie okay. It's okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,You used the Europe story!
Monica Geller,"Hello Greg? Hi, this is Monica from the plane? Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5... That is their old number! Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!"
Monica Geller,"Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday? Okay, how about Sunday? Okay umm, the week after that? The week after that? Y'know what Greg? Y'know what? We are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious Jenny can't see that then... January 15th? We'll see you then! Okay!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,Hey how was dinner?!
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,"Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef."
Monica Geller,"Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?"
Monica Geller,"All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad."
Monica Geller,"All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? You're single. You're single. He gets off work at eleven. She'll be waiting for your call. I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar."
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,I...I have to fire him.
Monica Geller,"Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!"
Monica Geller,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished."
Monica Geller,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!"
Monica Geller,I paid to have this done.
Monica Geller,"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!"
Monica Geller,"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""
Monica Geller,Why not?!
Monica Geller,What?! You said he was sweet!
Monica Geller,Just don't pick up your phone.
Monica Geller,What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
Monica Geller,"Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week."
Monica Geller,"Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!"
Monica Geller,What do you mean?
Monica Geller,I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,You're fired!
Monica Geller,You're fired.
Monica Geller,"Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right."
Monica Geller,Tim wait!
Monica Geller,"Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Hey you guys?
Monica Geller,"I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party."
Monica Geller,And everybody has to wear costumes. Come on! It'll be fun!
Monica Geller,You have to!
Monica Geller,"So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?"
Monica Geller,Wait! You're supposed to wear a costume!
Monica Geller,Oh.
Monica Geller,"I'm Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it."
Monica Geller,So we do Supergirl.
Monica Geller,What?! I thought he'd love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Monica Geller,"Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all."
Monica Geller,You didn't dress up either?!
Monica Geller,What?! There's only been like four kids.
Monica Geller,What are you supposed to be?
Monica Geller,"No, space doody!"
Monica Geller,Hey Joey?
Monica Geller,You read comic books right?
Monica Geller,"Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?"
Monica Geller,Yeah...
Monica Geller,What?! Really?!
Monica Geller,"No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?"
Monica Geller,What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! As hard as you can!
Monica Geller,"Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
Monica Geller,I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Ross is really strong! Okay, he's the strongest out of all three of you! Except for Joey."
Monica Geller,"Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment."
Monica Geller,"Look honey, you don't have to do this, okay? It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You're loyal, you're honest, and you have integrity! That's the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!"
Monica Geller,Oh God!
Monica Geller,Chandler's making his sex face.
Monica Geller,"Look, I wanted to tell I'm-I'm sorry you lost."
Monica Geller,Is that a secret or a lie.
Monica Geller,Chandler please!
Monica Geller,Let's go big bunny!
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!"
Monica Geller,"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?"
Monica Geller,Well then who?
Monica Geller,"I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then..."
Monica Geller,"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!"
Monica Geller,Did she really say that?
Monica Geller,"Fine, I can do it. Whew."
Monica Geller,"Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!"
Monica Geller,"Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met."
Monica Geller,I love her.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,She stole my jeans!
Monica Geller,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Monica Geller,Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
Monica Geller,I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Monica Geller,I guess.
Monica Geller,Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Nice jeans!
Monica Geller,Oh. You're not gettin' it.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I fell asleep."
Monica Geller,"Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch."
Monica Geller,Hello.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?"
Monica Geller,"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise."
Monica Geller,Because I put my head between her legs.
Monica Geller,They're my pants!
Monica Geller,No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Monica Geller,Fine. She's wearing my bra!
Monica Geller,My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Monica Geller,Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
Monica Geller,I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
Monica Geller,Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
Monica Geller,"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!"
Monica Geller,Do you see this?
Monica Geller,"Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip."
Monica Geller,Where did you get those jeans?!
Monica Geller,No I didn't!
Monica Geller,Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Monica Geller,The pink one with the flowers?!
Monica Geller,Sounds about right.
Monica Geller,No you don't!
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!"
Monica Geller,"Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!"
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better."
Monica Geller,"So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present."
Monica Geller,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Monica Geller,"Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?"
Monica Geller,Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
Monica Geller,My husband.
Monica Geller,She's a stripper.
Monica Geller,"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
Monica Geller,"She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone."
Monica Geller,I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off."
Monica Geller,Gotcha sailor.
Monica Geller,"Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?"
Monica Geller,"He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend."
Monica Geller,"No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here."
Monica Geller,"Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler."
Monica Geller,"All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year."
Monica Geller,Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...
Monica Geller,"All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry."
Monica Geller,"Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work."
Monica Geller,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.
Monica Geller,"All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,You too!
Monica Geller,"Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?"
Monica Geller,I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Monica Geller,"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?"
Monica Geller,Is your team winning hon?
Monica Geller,"Oh, I didn't know you liked football."
Monica Geller,You like Green Bay?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Aww thanks! God Will I'm so glad that you came! You look great! You must've lost like...
Monica Geller,A pie!
Monica Geller,"You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will."
Monica Geller,This is Phoebe.
Monica Geller,Wanna give me a hand?
Monica Geller,Well you look incredible too! You're just-you're so fit!
Monica Geller,"Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming."
Monica Geller,Good. And Rachel Green too.
Monica Geller,Is there a problem?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat."
Monica Geller,All right.
Monica Geller,Will! From high school.
Monica Geller,Joey.
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie. Oh good.
Monica Geller,That's Will from high school!
Monica Geller,"Okay, dinner's ready!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, so who won?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Uh Rachel? Rachel, why don't you sit here? And Will you sit way over there."
Monica Geller,This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.
Monica Geller,About nineteen pounds.
Monica Geller,"Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school."
Monica Geller,Oh Will. But you-you've worked so hard...
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,I swear I didn't. Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Monica Geller,"Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say."
Monica Geller,You started that?!
Monica Geller,Everyone at our school heard it!
Monica Geller,I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Monica Geller,"Joey, you don't have to finish that."
Monica Geller,Oh! Me too!
Monica Geller,That's not totally true.
Monica Geller,"Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman, our 50-year-old librarian."
Monica Geller,It's true?!!
Monica Geller,Didn't she walk with a cane?
Monica Geller,"All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!"
Monica Geller,"And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!"
Monica Geller,Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
Monica Geller,Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you've been through so much since then. And right now you've got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can't you just let this go?
Monica Geller,"Well Joey, we're all...we're all very proud of you."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you want some?"
Monica Geller,Hey! So what do you think?
Monica Geller,"Yes! Now, they're a little more than I normally spend on boots...or rent"
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you."""
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,They're mine!
Monica Geller,"Honey, I'm not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I'm going to wear them all the time. You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?"
Monica Geller,Nice try; I'm keeping the boots.
Monica Geller,Hey guys!
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"See Chandler? I'm getting a lot of use out of them already! They're very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants..."
Monica Geller,They hurt so much!
Monica Geller,The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Monica Geller,"I can't! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I'd wear them all the time, I just can't give them away!"
Monica Geller,I can't do that either! The soles' are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
Monica Geller,Ahhhhhhhh!
Monica Geller,Oh nothing I'm just-just was yawning.
Monica Geller,"Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing tonight do we?"
Monica Geller,I-I don't-I don't think that I'm gonna wear the boots tonight.
Monica Geller,"Well y'know, I'm just-I'm just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!"
Monica Geller,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it."
Monica Geller,"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on."
Monica Geller,Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!
Monica Geller,Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
Monica Geller,"Oh no, we can't walk!"
Monica Geller,Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
Monica Geller,I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Monica Geller,"Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!"
Monica Geller,How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Monica Geller,"Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh..."
Monica Geller,Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Monica Geller,My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots."
Monica Geller,Well I don't have them either. Where are they?
Monica Geller,"Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye."
Monica Geller,Okay. All right.
Monica Geller,Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!
Monica Geller,"Yes, hi."
Monica Geller,No leg-chewing for us sir.
Monica Geller,I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?"
Monica Geller,That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Monica Geller,Why did you do that?
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me."
Monica Geller,"Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you."
Monica Geller,You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Monica Geller,Like asking her to move in with you?
Monica Geller,Making her a mixed tape?
Monica Geller,"All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love you."
Monica Geller,That is a slap in the face.
Monica Geller,Hi Roger.
Monica Geller,"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you."
Monica Geller,From the tequila factory?
Monica Geller,Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Monica Geller,"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?"
Monica Geller,I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom."
Monica Geller,All right.
Monica Geller,"Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!"
Monica Geller,Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
Monica Geller,"Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something."
Monica Geller,Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm next. Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
Monica Geller,You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
Monica Geller,"No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?"
Monica Geller,"Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!"
Monica Geller,What is the matter with your hand?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, why would you do that?"
Monica Geller,You think this is clever?
Monica Geller,"Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty."
Monica Geller,"Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there."
Monica Geller,Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
Monica Geller,"All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it."
Monica Geller,Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Monica Geller,"All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right- Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?"
Monica Geller,They're all Chandler.
Monica Geller,But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!"
Monica Geller,Don't touch her!!
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,I just had the most amazing bath.
Monica Geller,"Wait, you like them with me."
Monica Geller,"Oh, baths are so relaxing!"
Monica Geller,"How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away."
Monica Geller,"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!"
Monica Geller,"No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?"
Monica Geller,I drew you a bath!
Monica Geller,"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!"
Monica Geller,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!"
Monica Geller,Absolutely.
Monica Geller,Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.
Monica Geller,So?
Monica Geller,"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!"
Monica Geller,Hello?
Monica Geller,You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.
Monica Geller,Oh. What's wrong?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Okay, let's talk about something else."
Monica Geller,"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and..."
Monica Geller,You did? What was he talking about?
Monica Geller,That was a long night.
Monica Geller,"Okay, he was talking about rules."
Monica Geller,"Umm, and looking at people differently."
Monica Geller,What did he tell you?
Monica Geller,"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone."
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Monica Geller,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"
Monica Geller,Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!
Monica Geller,"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?"
Monica Geller,You just stay here!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you had that?"
Monica Geller,"I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago."
Monica Geller,Nothing.
Monica Geller,"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to."
Monica Geller,It's a humdinger!
Monica Geller,Somebody likes you!
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,It's Joey!
Monica Geller,Is it something you'd be interested in?
Monica Geller,"I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?"
Monica Geller,"Not Chandler, just Joey."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine."
Monica Geller,What do you think you're doing?
Monica Geller,"I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum."
Monica Geller,"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!"
Monica Geller,She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,I don't think I'd care.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!"
Monica Geller,"Honey, cover it up with the boat!"
Monica Geller,"It sure is nice to do this together, isn't it?"
Monica Geller,I'm not touching you.
Monica Geller,It's the salts.
Monica Geller,"Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, what's up?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, okay. No problem."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Here you go.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Monica Geller,Yes! Exactly.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, I can explain!"
Monica Geller,"Well umm, Alexandra has been..."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, don't get upset!"
Monica Geller,Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don't like us do they?
Monica Geller,"No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?"
Monica Geller,Why don't we just find a place for it?
Monica Geller,No! That's where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
Monica Geller,"Oh, okay. Here, why don't you let me do it?"
Monica Geller,No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Monica Geller,Feminine stuff.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you'll let it go."
Monica Geller,Thank you!
Monica Geller,Well it's...I mean I'd just-I'd be self-conscious. You're my friend; I'd be naked.
Monica Geller,"That's different, we were roommates! And when?!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me."
Monica Geller,"Okay, if it means that much to you..."
Monica Geller,Dinosaurs.
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Monica Geller,No. Ooohh...
Monica Geller,Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Monica Geller,Oh God Phoebe!! Oh that's it! That's it! Right there! Oh! Ooooh-oooh-ooooh...
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!"
Monica Geller,"So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,What's going on?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,What?! You're crazy! There's nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Monica Geller,"Oh my-This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I'm never gonna get massaged again!"
Monica Geller,Really?!
Monica Geller,Are you sure?
Monica Geller,I guess.
Monica Geller,How did you get in there?!
Monica Geller,Oh no! You weren't supposed to see this!
Monica Geller,"No Chandler, you don't understand! Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I'm y'know...I'm sick."
Monica Geller,Really? You promise you won't tell anyone?
Monica Geller,Well...it's just umm...I'm afraid you might mess it up.
Monica Geller,Ohhh.
Monica Geller,Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Monica Geller,Oh God!
Monica Geller,Oh yeah right there!
Monica Geller,Uh Phoebe?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom."
Monica Geller,Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
Monica Geller,Not really.
Monica Geller,"All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?"
Monica Geller,"Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty."
Monica Geller,So what do you think?
Monica Geller,I've still got it!
Monica Geller,What is it?
Monica Geller,"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?"
Monica Geller,"Honey, what's going on?"
Monica Geller,Mm-hmm.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!"
Monica Geller,"Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful."
Monica Geller,"Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!"
Monica Geller,Don't touch me!
Monica Geller,How long has it been this time?
Monica Geller,That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
Monica Geller,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank God!"
Monica Geller,Come in!
Monica Geller,"Oh, my God."
Monica Geller,"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here."
Monica Geller,"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!"
Monica Geller,"She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape."
Monica Geller,It's...still beautiful.
Monica Geller,"I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!"
Monica Geller,Oh...Rach!
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were."
Monica Geller,"All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again."
Monica Geller,"Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react."
Monica Geller,Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Monica Geller,"No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont."
Monica Geller,He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.
Monica Geller,"Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend."
Monica Geller,"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money."
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"So, what have you guys been doing?"
Monica Geller,"I know! What is this, 1985?!"
Monica Geller,Not really.
Monica Geller,"So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there."
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'd like a latte. Oh y'know what? If you're gonna talk about me, I'm gonna go with you."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, good work."
Monica Geller,"Yeah! Oh he's great, I love him."
Monica Geller,"Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house."
Monica Geller,"You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat."
Monica Geller,I'd move in tomorrow!
Monica Geller,I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn't that be nice?
Monica Geller,Are you okay? You've been acting weird all afternoon.
Monica Geller,Jeez! What is with you?
Monica Geller,"All right, what's going on?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?"
Monica Geller,I don't believe in soul mates either.
Monica Geller,No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Monica Geller,"No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?"
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,"Joey, you have to talk to her!"
Monica Geller,Hey Rachel!
Monica Geller,I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
Monica Geller,What's up?
Monica Geller,We were playing a game.
Monica Geller,Sure.
Monica Geller,"Okay, did you hear that?"
Monica Geller,"Honey, you gotta talk to her."
Monica Geller,"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry."
Monica Geller,"This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm done. Read mine."
Monica Geller,I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
Monica Geller,You mean your pink shirt?
Monica Geller,"No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt."
Monica Geller,Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
Monica Geller,"Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?"
Monica Geller,Where is the James Taylor CD?
Monica Geller,"Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases."
Monica Geller,"Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on."
Monica Geller,"Good. Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?"
Monica Geller,"Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem."
Monica Geller,"Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah."
Monica Geller,"Honey, both yours."
Monica Geller,Yeah? The work problem?
Monica Geller,You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Monica Geller,Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Monica Geller,That's not your regular dry cleaners.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you."
Monica Geller,Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Monica Geller,"Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?"
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'd really like to."
Monica Geller,"Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry."
Monica Geller,"No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your brother."" Know what they'll say this year? ""God, you"""
Monica Geller,Really you can do that?
Monica Geller,"Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out."
Monica Geller,It's a dead dog. That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
Monica Geller,"The good stuff, huh?"
Monica Geller,You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Monica Geller,It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?"
Monica Geller,And I've got the car keys.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Monica Geller,"It's just that, it's so much."
Monica Geller,I feel terrible.
Monica Geller,Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
Monica Geller,"Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it."
Monica Geller,"No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!"
Monica Geller,"Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech."
Monica Geller,"Oh, come on."
Monica Geller,"Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!
Monica Geller,"Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?"
Monica Geller,You think we're being obvious?
Monica Geller,Joey! You're doing great!
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,"You can't say that!! You-you don't know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn't...bend that way. So..."
Monica Geller,You slept with her didn't you?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, your mother!"
Monica Geller,"Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was."
Monica Geller,"Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!"
Monica Geller,Oh give it a rest!
Monica Geller,"Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready."
Monica Geller,"Go! I have it in my book. Go! Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller."
Monica Geller,"Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four."
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Son of a bitch!
Monica Geller,You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,"Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it."
Monica Geller,She's still mad.
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?"
Monica Geller,Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Monica Geller,"That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!"
Monica Geller,This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
Monica Geller,"Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!"
Monica Geller,"Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart."
Monica Geller,It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
Monica Geller,It's frightening.
Monica Geller,You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
Monica Geller,Y'know what? You're-you're right.
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!"
Monica Geller,That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!
Monica Geller,"So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!"
Monica Geller,Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
Monica Geller,Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Monica Geller,"Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Monica Geller,Oh dear God!
Monica Geller,What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, this is horrible!"
Monica Geller,I'm so humiliated!
Monica Geller,"You don't think that umm, ""The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful,"" is bad press?"
Monica Geller,Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
Monica Geller,Joey! Now that you're here...
Monica Geller,"Hey Joey, come taste this."
Monica Geller,Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
Monica Geller,"No. He Teaches A Course On Food Criticism At The New School, So Before We Go To The Movies I Wanna Go By There And Make Him Try My Bouillabaisse Again. Oh, I Cannot Wait To Read The Front Page Of The Post Tomorrow! ""Restaurant Reviewer Admits I was wrong about Monica."""
Monica Geller,"Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's."
Monica Geller,"I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance."
Monica Geller,"Spoon? So, what do you think?"
Monica Geller,I can.
Monica Geller,"Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon."
Monica Geller,Monica.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles."
Monica Geller,"I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?"
Monica Geller,That's right.
Monica Geller,"Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star."
Monica Geller,"Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care."
Monica Geller,Joey! I'm so proud of you!
Monica Geller,Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
Monica Geller,I do! I'm a professional chef! Oh relax! It's not a courtroom drama!
Monica Geller,"I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review..."
Monica Geller,You do?
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?"
Monica Geller,"Okay then, I don't stink. I'm a good chef. Okay."
Monica Geller,"Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Are we gonna take a limo?
Monica Geller,Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Monica Geller,What are you doing here so early?
Monica Geller,"Well, well Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out. You snooze you lose."
Monica Geller,"Well then somebody's snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here."
Monica Geller,Star in a movie.
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!"
Monica Geller,"She's over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?"
Monica Geller,"Hmm, care to make it interesting? I'll bet you that she'll have it by this time tomorrow."
Monica Geller,"Okay, how much?"
Monica Geller,How about fifty bucks?
Monica Geller,Damnit! Damnit!! Here's your fifty bucks!
Monica Geller,Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,She's in the bathroom.
Monica Geller,I'm actually with her on this one.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Monica Geller,"Well what is it? What is it? If it's gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it."
Monica Geller,Do it!
Monica Geller,"I'm just saying it's been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!"
Monica Geller,"All right, let's be practical, if Ross isn't willing to do it, he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler-Chandler is good!"
Monica Geller,Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Monica Geller,Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby and I don't want to lose again!
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! Now I'm betting against all three of you?
Monica Geller,"Oh, okay!"
Monica Geller,Two hundred.
Monica Geller,"That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes, no more betting."
Monica Geller,Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I guess we can bet one more time.
Monica Geller,How did you know that?! Joey! Chandler!! It's time!
Monica Geller,"You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. I bet you it has hair. I bet you it's a girl."
Monica Geller,I'll give you really good odds.
Monica Geller,How are you doing?
Monica Geller,We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Monica Geller,"Hey, you wanna see something?"
Monica Geller,"Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?"
Monica Geller,"Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby."
Monica Geller,What-what-what's that now?!
Monica Geller,What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
Monica Geller,Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Monica Geller,"Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. 'Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father."
Monica Geller,That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
Monica Geller,Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
Monica Geller,What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,We are pretty good.
Monica Geller,"Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right."
Monica Geller,What?!!
Monica Geller,"So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, hold on a sec."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Well, we could start trying. Now."
Monica Geller,"No, not here. Maybe here."
Monica Geller,And it's so clean!!
Monica Geller,I think we found a place.
Monica Geller,"Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?"
Monica Geller,"Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay."
Monica Geller,Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
Monica Geller,"We could, or we can have sex in it."
Monica Geller,Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Monica Geller,Does that sound like Janice?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!"
Monica Geller,What's the matter?
Monica Geller,"It's okay honey, you'll find a name."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen."
Monica Geller,"Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel."
Monica Geller,I don't want to say.
Monica Geller,Okay. It's Emma.
Monica Geller,Take it.
Monica Geller,It's clearly an Emma.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean... Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!"
Monica Geller,"I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby."
Monica Geller,Hi! Hey look who's here!
Monica Geller,"Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!"
Monica Geller,About what?
Monica Geller,Isn't she beautiful?
Monica Geller,I want a baby.
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?"
Monica Geller,Deal!
Monica Geller,"Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!"
Monica Geller,Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Monica Geller,It wasn't fun?!
Monica Geller,"The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant."
Monica Geller,"Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later."
Monica Geller,Daddy?!
Monica Geller,Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
Monica Geller,I don't feel good right now.
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!
Monica Geller,"What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!"
Monica Geller,You can't marry him!
Monica Geller,Well do you love him?
Monica Geller,Sure?
Monica Geller,"Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?"
Monica Geller,Hey dad!
Monica Geller,"Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good."
Monica Geller,So sexy. Honey.
Monica Geller,Honey why don't you go lie down.
Monica Geller,Phoebe did the signs!
Monica Geller,Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Monica Geller,"Wow, he's really not letting this go, is he?"
Monica Geller,Breaks your heart doesn't it.
Monica Geller,"Alright here's something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side."
Monica Geller,It worked!
Monica Geller,"Umm, she Rach, not it, she."
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, I am losing my mind."
Monica Geller,Try feeding her again.
Monica Geller,"I know, that's why I said again!"
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,Okay what's up.
Monica Geller,Oh yeah .
Monica Geller,What? Who says that?
Monica Geller,What's going on?
Monica Geller,Excuse me?
Monica Geller,"Tulsa, Oklahoma!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, I don't even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!"
Monica Geller,"Are you trying to tell me that we're moving to Oklahoma, or that you're gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?"
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,"Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa."
Monica Geller,About a week and a half.
Monica Geller,"Rach, try holding her a different way."
Monica Geller,"You're just new at this, it'll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn't have been easy but you figured that out."
Monica Geller,"Okay I'll take her, here."
Monica Geller,"Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby."
Monica Geller,"It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!"
Monica Geller,I can't believe it! She's asleep! I got her to go to sleep! I have actual magical powers!
Monica Geller,"Yes I did, I'm Monica, Super Aunt."
Monica Geller,Yes I am!!
Monica Geller,Say what?
Monica Geller,Oh no no no no!
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,What!?
Monica Geller,Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
Monica Geller,I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Monica Geller,"It's great! How? Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you."
Monica Geller,So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
Monica Geller,No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year."
Monica Geller,"Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you."
Monica Geller,I know!
Monica Geller,Excuse me?
Monica Geller,Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Monica Geller,"He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox."
Monica Geller,"Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out."
Monica Geller,That I was going to eat him.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,That's so sweet. Find anything?
Monica Geller,"Nothing, huh?"
Monica Geller,'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Monica Geller,"Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something."
Monica Geller,"Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'"
Monica Geller,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
Monica Geller,"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa."
Monica Geller,Manhattan.
Monica Geller,"I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
Monica Geller,"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend."
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Monica Geller,How was the pediatrician?
Monica Geller,Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Monica Geller,Where have you been?
Monica Geller,Promise to call me when you land.
Monica Geller,I love you too.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, new job, you. This is just something I have to do."
Monica Geller,I love you so much.
Monica Geller,Can I talk now?

Monica Geller,: is everything all right?
Monica Geller,: I'm gonna go freshen up ok.
Monica Geller,: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
Monica Geller,: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
Monica Geller,: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
Monica Geller,": do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing."
Monica Geller,: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
Monica Geller,: Eww are you talking about my bother.
Monica Geller,: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
Monica Geller,": what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night."
Monica Geller,: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
Monica Geller,": Joey, Joey."
Monica Geller,: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
Monica Geller,": Hi, how was your flight?"
Monica Geller,": Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I. have a little surprise for you."
Monica Geller,: Ok This is how much I love you.
Monica Geller,: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Monica Geller,": Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?"
Monica Geller,": Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash."
Monica Geller,": sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this."
Monica Geller,: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
Monica Geller,: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
Monica Geller,: really?
Monica Geller,: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
Monica Geller,": Im very, very drunk right now."
Monica Geller,What are you talking about? We're all together right now.
Monica Geller,"Oh, dear god!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Hmhmm.
Monica Geller,"This is not, what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating and Chandler's gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner."
Monica Geller,"Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We'll probably be the first ones there."
Monica Geller,Welcome home. I've missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Monica Geller,"O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?"
Monica Geller,You don't need a shower.
Monica Geller,What do I smell? I smell smoke. Huh-did you smoke?
Monica Geller,
Monica Geller,"How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling."
Monica Geller,So what? Don't you have any will power?
Monica Geller,You said that was sexy!
Monica Geller,"That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again."
Monica Geller,Mhmm.
Monica Geller,"Don't joke with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now."
Monica Geller,Yes.
Monica Geller,"Well, I'll tell you what we're gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex."
Monica Geller,"Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't do it now, we'll have to wait till next month."
Monica Geller,Oh yeah!
Monica Geller,"Huh, and no cuddling."
Monica Geller,"Oh good, I hate it when you do that."
Monica Geller,Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.
Monica Geller,"Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral."
Monica Geller,"No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world."
Monica Geller,Yah.
Monica Geller,D'you want to?
Monica Geller,'kay.
Monica Geller,You know what? Let's not talk.
Monica Geller,Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Monica Geller,"Oh, blablablabaybaybay."
Monica Geller,I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.
Monica Geller,"That's right, I got mine."
Monica Geller,Happy birthday!
Monica Geller,"Well, we had a little fight."
Monica Geller,"You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck."
Monica Geller,Why would you do that?
Monica Geller,"Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town."
Monica Geller,"Uch, you see, I'm ovulating."
Monica Geller,"Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough."
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,"So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?"
Monica Geller,We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...
Monica Geller,I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Monica Geller,YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean."
Monica Geller,"Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met."
Monica Geller,Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Monica Geller,"Oh, well... That had been your window."
Monica Geller,Really? The scientist guy?
Monica Geller,Continue...
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
Monica Geller,What are you gonna do?
Monica Geller,You have to tell David!
Monica Geller,Heeeeeey!
Monica Geller,Was your cabin pressurised?
Monica Geller,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?"
Monica Geller,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken."
Monica Geller,Hi! There you are.
Monica Geller,Yeah! I think that's great!
Monica Geller,Oh... How are they?
Monica Geller,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, so?"
Monica Geller,"Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey..."
Monica Geller,I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!"
Monica Geller,"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!"
Monica Geller,"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey."
Monica Geller,"Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks..."
Monica Geller,"Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me."
Monica Geller,"Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore."
Monica Geller,"Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you."
Monica Geller,"Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out."
Monica Geller,What do you do with your money now?
Monica Geller,Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Monica Geller,"Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!"
Monica Geller,My dad told me. They play golf together.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step."
Monica Geller,"They just gonna love you, just be yourself."
Monica Geller,"Oh God, neither!"
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine."
Monica Geller,You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Monica Geller,I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Monica Geller,She said WHAT?
Monica Geller,"What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?"
Monica Geller,So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Monica Geller,That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Monica Geller,Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Monica Geller,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Monica Geller,"Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters."
Monica Geller,Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!
Monica Geller,THAT'S NOT ME!
Monica Geller,That bastard taped over me!
Monica Geller,"I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!"
Monica Geller,"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?"
Monica Geller,"No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over."
Monica Geller,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive."
Monica Geller,"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over.."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen."
Monica Geller,Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.
Monica Geller,"I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones."
Monica Geller,"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me."
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Hey you.
Monica Geller,So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
Monica Geller,"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved."
Monica Geller,Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
Monica Geller,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt."
Monica Geller,"No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins."
Monica Geller,That was me.
Monica Geller,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun."
Monica Geller,"Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun."
Monica Geller,Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
Monica Geller,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Monica Geller,No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Monica Geller,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
Monica Geller,"Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?"
Monica Geller,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!
Monica Geller,Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Monica Geller,Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.
Monica Geller,Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Monica Geller,Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!
Monica Geller,uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
Monica Geller,Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
Monica Geller,I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
Monica Geller,Like only if the queen comes?
Monica Geller,Bye plates!
Monica Geller,What? Something happened with the plates?
Monica Geller,Hello?
Monica Geller,"Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week."
Monica Geller,"Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."" So, if you could just realize it on your own . . ."
Monica Geller,Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa."
Monica Geller,I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
Monica Geller,"Yes, because all good plans start with, ""I'll go down the fire escape."""
Monica Geller,Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.
Monica Geller,Scary pigeon's back?
Monica Geller,Chandler! You're home!
Monica Geller,What are you saying?
Monica Geller,There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.
Monica Geller,I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
Monica Geller,I think that's you.
Monica Geller,I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.
Monica Geller,"Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya."
Monica Geller,Joey?
Monica Geller,I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.
Monica Geller,You can go.
Monica Geller,You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction."
Monica Geller,It's gonna be so hot!
Monica Geller,Have fun.
Monica Geller,I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Monica Geller,"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!"
Monica Geller,"It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand."
Monica Geller,You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,Come on Ben.
Monica Geller,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say."
Monica Geller,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, is that okay?"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Monica Geller,So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Monica Geller,Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Monica Geller,"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?"
Monica Geller,"Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?"
Monica Geller,What does she do there?
Monica Geller,She did WHAT?
Monica Geller,*What*??
Monica Geller,"Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work."
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Merry Christmas.
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Well, not anymore."
Monica Geller,"I know, I just thought it would be fun."
Monica Geller,Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Y'know what's weird?
Monica Geller,This doesn't feel weird!
Monica Geller,You're a really good kisser.
Monica Geller,Hm-hmm!
Monica Geller,Wow! You are really fast!
Monica Geller,We're gonna see each other naked.
Monica Geller,Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Monica Geller,One!
Monica Geller,Two!
Monica Geller,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!"
Monica Geller,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him."
Monica Geller,I think you're better than you think you are.
Monica Geller,Know when to stop.
Monica Geller,Yeah. Don't do the dance.
Monica Geller,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue."
Monica Geller,You're so efficient. I love you!
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!"
Monica Geller,That'll work!
Monica Geller,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!"
Monica Geller,That's stealing!
Monica Geller,Ohh.
Monica Geller,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that."
Monica Geller,"Eh, you work for that."
Monica Geller,You do?!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?"
Monica Geller,You thought about that?
Monica Geller,How many kids were we gonna have?
Monica Geller,What else did you think about?
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
Monica Geller,"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage."
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.
Monica Geller,I love you.
Monica Geller,"""Wendy"" is a fat girl name."
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?"
Monica Geller,What are you doing here?
Monica Geller,"But I thought if you left, you get fired."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh my god!
Monica Geller,"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!"
Monica Geller,"You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?"
Monica Geller,"Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant."
Monica Geller,"Well, I just lost my erection."
Monica Geller,You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Monica Geller,"Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!"
Monica Geller,I know!!! My erection is back!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision."
Monica Geller,Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Monica Geller,Don't you want to look through the rest?
Monica Geller,"You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!"
Monica Geller,"I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."""
Monica Geller,I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Monica Geller,"""Marriage. It's not for everybody."""
Monica Geller,"Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller."
Monica Geller,We're gonna have sex.
Monica Geller,Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
Monica Geller,"Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees."
Monica Geller,Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,What!? You faked it?
Monica Geller,You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
Monica Geller,"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
Monica Geller,Like a month?
Monica Geller,"Really, you want to wait a year?"
Monica Geller,I really wanna have a baby.
Monica Geller,"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration."
Monica Geller,"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons."
Monica Geller,"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!"
Monica Geller,"Yes, please!"
Monica Geller,I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
Monica Geller,Would you stop staring at her?
Monica Geller,What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Monica Geller,"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once."
Monica Geller,They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Monica Geller,Take me home!
Monica Geller,Hey Rach!
Monica Geller,Ready for your birthday lunch?
Monica Geller,Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Monica Geller,You were just being so nice to him!
Monica Geller,Right there! That was so fake!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time."
Monica Geller,Does he?
Monica Geller,Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
Monica Geller,Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!"
Monica Geller,So this is what a stroke feels like.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?"
Monica Geller,"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up ."
Monica Geller,"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover."
Monica Geller,"Again, you're welcome."
Monica Geller,Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Monica Geller,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are..."
Monica Geller,Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Monica Geller,"It's just, I'm not good at singing."
Monica Geller,"No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!"
Monica Geller,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
Monica Geller,I'm there!
Monica Geller,You kissed him?
Monica Geller,Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Monica Geller,Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Monica Geller,I thought you hated him?
Monica Geller,So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
Monica Geller,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross."
Monica Geller,No I told you I can't.
Monica Geller,What have you heard me sing?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Yeah I do rock that one.
Monica Geller,Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
Monica Geller,"""Delta Dawn"""
Monica Geller,Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Monica Geller,"Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing ""Delta Dawn""""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."""
Monica Geller,"""To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"""
Monica Geller,"""Take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?"
Monica Geller,"I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting ""look at those tips""! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?"
Monica Geller,Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
Monica Geller,"Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters ""I am so excited"". And make it bouncy!"
Monica Geller,"Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!"
Monica Geller,And they love me!
Monica Geller,"All right, watch!"
Monica Geller,"""Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."""
Monica Geller,"Oh, who cares, they still love me! ""I am so excited..."""
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?"
Monica Geller,Oh my god.
Monica Geller,"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
Monica Geller,"You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, it's perfect."
Monica Geller,"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"No, it's not."
Monica Geller,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here."
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Monica Geller,"So, let's do this."
Monica Geller,"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute."
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone."
Monica Geller,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?"
Monica Geller,Canoodling?
Monica Geller,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so..."
Monica Geller,I guess you're right.
Monica Geller,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
Monica Geller,She's asleep. Chandler?
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,She's asleep.
Monica Geller,"Yes, but we have to be fast."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll try."
Monica Geller,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test."
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
Monica Geller,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, how's it going?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, did you stop by here?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, then..."
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic."
Monica Geller,Why the hell did you take her?
Monica Geller,"No, we weren't!"
Monica Geller,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
Monica Geller,Unless what?
Monica Geller,Really? Let's get past the moment.
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, that's incredible!"
Monica Geller,"Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?"""
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,He just left.
Monica Geller,What is she talking about?
Monica Geller,Is it a good play?
Monica Geller,He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
Monica Geller,"No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass."
Monica Geller,Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Monica Geller,"Hey, how did the audition go?"
Monica Geller,What happened?
Monica Geller,So far so good!
Monica Geller,What's wrong?
Monica Geller,So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
Monica Geller,What are they?
Monica Geller,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time."
Monica Geller,"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?"
Monica Geller,You okay?!
Monica Geller,How do you know a mugger?
Monica Geller,Seriously?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, that is awful!"
Monica Geller,You're mother killed herself!
Monica Geller,"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross."
Monica Geller,"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid."
Monica Geller,Wonderwoman!
Monica Geller,Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Monica Geller,That's it.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Yeah?
Monica Geller,So?
Monica Geller,"""Geology rocks!"""
Monica Geller,Oh my god!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,"No, that seems about right."
Monica Geller,"Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!"
Monica Geller,... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Monica Geller,... everybody we know? Yeah.
Monica Geller,I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Monica Geller,"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in."
Monica Geller,"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold."
Monica Geller,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Monica Geller,Hey Joey!
Monica Geller,"Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler."
Monica Geller,Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Monica Geller,But Chandler lent you money!
Monica Geller,Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Monica Geller,Two thousand dollars?
Monica Geller,Yeah...
Monica Geller,"Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?"
Monica Geller,You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Monica Geller,"Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look like"""
Monica Geller,Is that a bit you guys do?
Monica Geller,We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Monica Geller,I hear wedding bells.
Monica Geller,Don't you mean..groomy?
Monica Geller,I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Monica Geller,So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Monica Geller,Thank you?
Monica Geller,"Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?"
Monica Geller,"Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok."
Monica Geller,Okay...
Monica Geller,I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Monica Geller,Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Monica Geller,"You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler."
Monica Geller,Honey?
Monica Geller,About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Monica Geller,I'm going to get bigger!
Monica Geller,"Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too."
Monica Geller,It's kind of a package deal!
Monica Geller,I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Monica Geller,"Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money."
Monica Geller,We're all sorry...
Monica Geller,Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Monica Geller,"Ok, you got it!"
Monica Geller,Really? If that's what you want...
Monica Geller,Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Monica Geller,"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... ""gay as the day is long""?"
Monica Geller,But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
Monica Geller,"Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge."
Monica Geller,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Monica Geller,"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone."
Monica Geller,And now your cell.
Monica Geller,This is your cellphone?
Monica Geller,This is your current cellphone?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, where's your purse?"
Monica Geller,"No, no! Give it to me!"
Monica Geller,Give it to me!
Monica Geller,I'll go in there.
Monica Geller,Phoebe come here.
Monica Geller,Haha!
Monica Geller,Haha!
Monica Geller,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
Monica Geller,"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping."
Monica Geller,Who's that?
Monica Geller,What are you doing here?
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Monica Geller,Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Monica Geller,This doesn't concern you!!
Monica Geller,"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder."
Monica Geller,"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend ."
Monica Geller,Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
Monica Geller,I've been pretty good!
Monica Geller,Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Monica Geller,"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!"
Monica Geller,"Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it."
Monica Geller,"Kiss him, you fool!!"
Monica Geller,Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Monica Geller,"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!"
Monica Geller,Excuse me?
Monica Geller,"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was."
Monica Geller,You didn't hear the speech!
Monica Geller,"Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!"
Monica Geller,You're... weird!
Monica Geller,Oh !
Monica Geller,Damn it!
Monica Geller,And I blame you too.
Monica Geller,"Hi, glad you could come."
Monica Geller,"So, did you know Ross well?"
Monica Geller,"Yes, he is. Me."
Monica Geller,I look like a man??
Monica Geller,You are married though.
Monica Geller,Ok.
Monica Geller,But ehm...what is it not?
Monica Geller,And what else is it not?
Monica Geller,Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
Monica Geller,"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars."
Monica Geller,How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Monica Geller,God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Monica Geller,Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Monica Geller,That was a good day!
Monica Geller,I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Monica Geller,"So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three."
Monica Geller,Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
Monica Geller,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work."
Monica Geller,"Alright, who wants to do it?"
Monica Geller,"Ok, hey Rach?"
Monica Geller,"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?"
Monica Geller,"Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!"
Monica Geller,"I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?"
Monica Geller,"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you."
Monica Geller,"Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this."
Monica Geller,"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!"
Monica Geller,"Come on, lottery!!"
Monica Geller,"Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first."
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, idea time is over."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Monica Geller,"Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, sense the tone!!"
Monica Geller,"Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler."
Monica Geller,"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!"
Monica Geller,When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
Monica Geller,"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!"
Monica Geller,Ahhh!
Monica Geller,There's the man I married!!
Monica Geller,"Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!"
Monica Geller,"No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!"
Monica Geller,Money! Friends...
Monica Geller,They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, we lost half of them."
Monica Geller,"Oh, play them!"
Monica Geller,"Oh God, I am so sorry honey..."
Monica Geller,"Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job."
Monica Geller,131!
Monica Geller,"We are on a roll, people!!"
Monica Geller,Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Monica Geller,Make me rich!!
Monica Geller,"Just double checking ...no, no, no... No!"
Monica Geller,Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Monica Geller,"Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!"
Monica Geller,You bet! No TV or anything!
Monica Geller,Seven.
Monica Geller,Let me see!
Monica Geller,You know what? You can have mine.
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?"
Monica Geller,Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am."
Monica Geller,Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
Monica Geller,Why don't you take Ross?
Monica Geller,"No, not if their room has two beds!"
Monica Geller,Thank you! 2nd Customer: It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Monica Geller,Thank you! You haven't said anything... 3rd Customer: Actually I do have one small complaint.
Monica Geller,Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism. 3rd Customer: The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Monica Geller,What musician?
Monica Geller,What are you doing here!
Monica Geller,Great!
Monica Geller,Listen Phoebe...
Monica Geller,"You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but..."
Monica Geller,This is kind of a classy place.
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head."
Monica Geller,"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?"
Monica Geller,What do you think brought than on?
Monica Geller,A love scene? With who?
Monica Geller,"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important."
Monica Geller,"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
Monica Geller,"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college."
Monica Geller,It was hard! Phoebe: Hey!
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
Monica Geller,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Monica Geller,Tiny portions?
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
Monica Geller,"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in."
Monica Geller,"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs."
Monica Geller,"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy."
Monica Geller,"Ok, you have to stop playing now."
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!"
Monica Geller,"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?"
Monica Geller,"Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? ."
Monica Geller,Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
Monica Geller,Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?
Monica Geller,I'm sorry...
Monica Geller,ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Monica Geller,"Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird...it's empty! Ross: Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?"
Monica Geller,It sounds interesting!
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"No, I don't think it ever works. Why?"
Monica Geller,"No, no, Rachel?"
Monica Geller,Who do you wanna fool around with?
Monica Geller,You can't!
Monica Geller,In the hall.
Monica Geller,You wanna fool around with Joey?
Monica Geller,Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Monica Geller,"Who, who are they?"
Monica Geller,Both of them?
Monica Geller,Which one?
Monica Geller,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
Monica Geller,What the hell are you cooking!
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,What's so bad about that?
Monica Geller,: Ross?
Monica Geller,Is he gonna introduce us?
Monica Geller,Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Monica Geller,"So, did you two have fun?"
Monica Geller,And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a HOTTY!! HI!
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?"
Monica Geller,You're not sick!
Monica Geller,"Ok, then, why are you... all dressed up??"
Monica Geller,You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Monica Geller,"Ok, what is this?"
Monica Geller,WHAT?
Monica Geller,Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Monica Geller,The game's over! Take off your robe!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Monica Geller,I love you!
Monica Geller,Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself."
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Chandler!
Monica Geller,"Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this ""best wishes"" crap. I want ""love""."
Monica Geller,Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Monica Geller,Look at you with all the guys!
Monica Geller,I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Monica Geller,"Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?"
Monica Geller,"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry."
Monica Geller,You really liked it?
Monica Geller,Oh really!
Monica Geller,No!
Monica Geller,So I got it when I was 13...
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea."
Monica Geller,That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Monica Geller,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Monica Geller,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Monica Geller,And I can't stop you.
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so wonderful."
Monica Geller,"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie."
Monica Geller,"Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Hey, what's this?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains."
Monica Geller,Do you wanna go hunting?
Monica Geller,"And she wants to go hunting, too!!"
Monica Geller,Hey honey! I missed you today!
Monica Geller,Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
Monica Geller,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
Monica Geller,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests."
Monica Geller,What is the big deal?
Monica Geller,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Monica Geller,"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!"
Monica Geller,OH!
Monica Geller,"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that."
Monica Geller,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?"
Monica Geller,"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!"
Monica Geller,This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
Monica Geller,"So, what's your name?"
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie.
Monica Geller,"With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said ""Doctor Connelly just called"". If it was good news you would have said ""Doctor Connelly just called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh... what does that mean?
Monica Geller,Chandler?
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,I'm sorry too.
Monica Geller,I know. Closing credits.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!"
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,Ok.
Monica Geller,"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
Monica Geller,Ok.
Monica Geller,Hi honey!
Monica Geller,"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!"
Monica Geller,I got it.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I guess."
Monica Geller,Excuse me?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!"
Monica Geller,Chandler!
Monica Geller,I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Monica Geller,Uh!
Monica Geller,"Tell me about yourself, Zack!"
Monica Geller,Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Monica Geller,"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!"
Monica Geller,I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Monica Geller,"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?"
Monica Geller,"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?"
Monica Geller,We're just making conversation.
Monica Geller,Yess!!
Monica Geller,Does seem pretty perfect.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you."
Monica Geller,"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm sure."
Monica Geller,That is so sweet. I love you.
Monica Geller,Adoption.
Monica Geller,I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Monica Geller,"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!"
Monica Geller,"And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived."
Monica Geller,"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air."
Monica Geller,See?
Monica Geller,"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip."
Monica Geller,Let's get you out of here!!
Monica Geller,At least you took me down with you!
Monica Geller,"I guess, in time."
Monica Geller,"I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone."
Monica Geller,Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Monica Geller,"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee."
Monica Geller,What? Why?
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
Monica Geller,"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again."
Monica Geller,"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!"
Monica Geller,And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
Monica Geller,"Yeah, right!"
Monica Geller,Ok!
Monica Geller,See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Monica Geller,Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?
Monica Geller,I need to talk to you.
Monica Geller,"Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight."
Monica Geller,What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Monica Geller,Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Monica Geller,"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
Monica Geller,"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!"
Monica Geller,"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!"
Monica Geller,"You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!"
Monica Geller,"Well, I hope you're happy!"
Monica Geller,"Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
Monica Geller,"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!"
Monica Geller,"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen."
Monica Geller,"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!"
Monica Geller,I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go."
Monica Geller,IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Monica Geller,"You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring..."
Monica Geller,BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,The sun is out!
Monica Geller,"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion."
Monica Geller,Damn it!
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!"
Monica Geller,"So, what are we gonna do today?"
Monica Geller,"Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!"
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,I'm not always that bad!
Monica Geller,I punched you...?
Monica Geller,... Phoebe...?
Monica Geller,I clunked your heads together!
Monica Geller,"C'mon guys, it'll be fun!"
Monica Geller,But then how do we know who wins?
Monica Geller,"So, we're just four losers... SUPER!"
Monica Geller,OK!
Monica Geller,Sure! Got to!
Monica Geller,Aww!
Monica Geller,"Hell, yeah!"
Monica Geller,How much were you thinking?
Monica Geller,Make it fifty!
Monica Geller,One thousand...
Monica Geller,No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
Monica Geller,"Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!"
Monica Geller,"Ow, what are the chances!"
Monica Geller,Ha! My point!
Monica Geller,"Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!"
Monica Geller,"Ah, yeah!"
Monica Geller,"Ah, yeaaah!"
Monica Geller,AH YEAAAAH!
Monica Geller,"Oh, damn it!"
Monica Geller,"Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?"
Monica Geller,"NO, NO, NOOO!"
Monica Geller,Best out of three?
Monica Geller,"Serve the ball, chump!"
Monica Geller,"No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!"
Monica Geller,I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Monica Geller,"Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!"
Monica Geller,That's just good sense!
Monica Geller,Aww!
Monica Geller,"No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!"
Monica Geller,I can't believe it! I lost!
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Honey, you don't have to do this."
Monica Geller,But... you suck!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! You're good!
Monica Geller,Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
Monica Geller,Why?
Monica Geller,This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Monica Geller,"Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?"
Monica Geller,I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Monica Geller,What's up?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls."
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, that's Charlie!"
Monica Geller,I'm not sure about this.
Monica Geller,No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!"
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Monica Geller,I'm on it!
Monica Geller,I think I hear curtains closing...
Monica Geller,"Bedsprings, unmistakable!"
Monica Geller,"Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon."
Monica Geller,"Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!"
Monica Geller,"Other wall, people! Other wall!"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?"
Monica Geller,Check it out!
Monica Geller,What do you think?
Monica Geller,Don't you just love it?
Monica Geller,And listen to this...
Monica Geller,"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!"
Monica Geller,Yeah!
Monica Geller,"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?"
Monica Geller,"It's ""Bolero"" from ""10""."
Monica Geller,You what? You said you liked them.
Monica Geller,"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does."
Monica Geller,"You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!"
Monica Geller,And the eye!
Monica Geller,Not really.
Monica Geller,I have a problem.
Monica Geller,"Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman, No Cry"" and I got stuck."
Monica Geller,"Oh, well, I can move..."
Monica Geller,I guess so...
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free."
Monica Geller,Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
Monica Geller,"Sure, what do you have in mind?"
Monica Geller,Really? I don't really feel like it.
Monica Geller,"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much."
Monica Geller,"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Monica Geller,"Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies."
Monica Geller,That's not really how it works.
Monica Geller,I don't know!
Monica Geller,"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?"
Monica Geller,Hi Frank.
Monica Geller,"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!"
Monica Geller,Which one is which again?
Monica Geller,"""Willing to adopt triplets?"" No!"
Monica Geller,Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Monica Geller,"Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us."
Monica Geller,Oh my god!
Monica Geller,Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Monica Geller,It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Monica Geller,Can I adopt you?
Monica Geller,They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Monica Geller,Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, Phoebs."
Monica Geller,"Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie!
Monica Geller,Chandler gets pedicures!
Monica Geller,There. Here's their card.
Monica Geller,Hey Phoebe!
Monica Geller,"I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!"
Monica Geller,"She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. ""Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"""
Monica Geller,Chandler gets pedicures!
Monica Geller,"I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met."
Monica Geller,"Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!"
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! Have you ever done that?"
Monica Geller,"No, no, don't get it. Let the machine pick up."
Monica Geller,It could be Amanda!
Monica Geller,You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Monica Geller,"We weren't picking up, it's Amanda!"
Monica Geller,"Hi Amanda! Actually now... it's... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!"
Monica Geller,"Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn't say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!"
Monica Geller,And you would?
Monica Geller,"How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!"
Monica Geller,One Two Three...
Monica Geller,"Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open."
Monica Geller,"Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!"
Monica Geller,Hey Phoebe!
Monica Geller,Is Amanda here yet?
Monica Geller,"Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency."
Monica Geller,"Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?"
Monica Geller,Hi!
Monica Geller,Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Monica Geller,When were we not friends?
Monica Geller,"Ehm, we were friends in 1992."
Monica Geller,You were going to cut me out?
Monica Geller,Oh My God!
Monica Geller,"Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? Oh my God, are you alright? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident."
Monica Geller,Nope!
Monica Geller,We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Monica Geller,I have nothing to say to you.
Monica Geller,"I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?"
Monica Geller,I'm still all those things!
Monica Geller,I am scrappy.
Monica Geller,It's because I'm scrappy.
Monica Geller,I won't know what I would do without you.
Monica Geller,"Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda."
Monica Geller,Hey guys!
Monica Geller,That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
Monica Geller,"Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?"
Monica Geller,"Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally."
Monica Geller,"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party."
Monica Geller,"Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!"
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Monica Geller,"Are you freaking kidding me, Green?"
Monica Geller,So glad you came!
Monica Geller,I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Monica Geller,I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid."
Monica Geller,"Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?"
Monica Geller,"Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!"
Monica Geller,"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!"
Monica Geller,"Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour."
Monica Geller,"Alright, 5 more minutes."
Monica Geller,No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
Monica Geller,"No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!"
Monica Geller,No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Monica Geller,"Ok, ten."
Monica Geller,"Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!"
Monica Geller,Everybody get your toys!
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!"
Monica Geller,What are you barking at?
Monica Geller,Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Monica Geller,"No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically..."
Monica Geller,"Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size."
Monica Geller,Game?
Monica Geller,That's how old you are.
Monica Geller,"Ooh, I want one..."
Monica Geller,...and head to Canada!
Monica Geller,I wasn't. Let's get going!
Monica Geller,What about your massage client?
Monica Geller,Thanks!
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us."
Monica Geller,Thank you!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with the words""."
Monica Geller,Clearly we were wrong.
Monica Geller,"You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it."
Monica Geller,Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Monica Geller,You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
Monica Geller,It doesn't make any sense.
Monica Geller,"Alright, what was this sentence originally?"
Monica Geller,"Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this."
Monica Geller,"Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song."
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?"
Monica Geller,"Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!"
Monica Geller,"I proposed to Chandler! Alright, moving on..."
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,"How about at a game, on the big screen?"
Monica Geller,"What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!"
Monica Geller,"No, sorry sweety.."
Monica Geller,You dropped it off?
Monica Geller,You hand-wrote it?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!"
Monica Geller,Okay good.
Monica Geller,"Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,They thought Joey was a child?
Monica Geller,"Hey, what did you guys do today?"
Monica Geller,Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Monica Geller,"I'm a cool, fun aunt!"
Monica Geller,What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Monica Geller,"Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, right."
Monica Geller,"Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!"
Monica Geller,"Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?"
Monica Geller,Who's Gladys? Oh! What a tragic loss!
Monica Geller,"Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know..."
Monica Geller,"Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!"
Monica Geller,"Absolutely! Yes, you say to him ""I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"""
Monica Geller,"Damn it, I did not think this through!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?"
Monica Geller,"Wow, what's the bad news!"
Monica Geller,Huh!
Monica Geller,"You know, I would give her up, for you."
Monica Geller,But I want to.
Monica Geller,But I insist!
Monica Geller,"No, that landed in your food!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, my!"
Monica Geller,I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Monica Geller,I like that poster!
Monica Geller,Are you still here?
Monica Geller,Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Monica Geller,"No, too late. You can't give it back!"
Monica Geller,No you can't. She's yours!
Monica Geller,SHE'S YOURS!
Monica Geller,She's m-i-i-ne!
Monica Geller,She's mine!
Monica Geller,She's mine!
Monica Geller,She's mine!
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,We?
Monica Geller,"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state."
Monica Geller,"Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?"
Monica Geller,Chandler?
Monica Geller,"Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?"
Monica Geller,It isn't mine!
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!"
Monica Geller,Ok.
Monica Geller,"We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don't know if you wanna use it, but..."
Monica Geller,I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Monica Geller,That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Monica Geller,"That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?"
Monica Geller,"Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!"
Monica Geller,Yay!
Monica Geller,"Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!"
Monica Geller,"Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in."
Monica Geller,Would you like something to drink?
Monica Geller,Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
Monica Geller,"Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it."
Monica Geller,Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
Monica Geller,Really? What is it?
Monica Geller,Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Monica Geller,Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Monica Geller,"Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye."
Monica Geller,It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Monica Geller,Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Monica Geller,Hey guys!
Monica Geller,We need to talk to you about something.
Monica Geller,"No, it's not!"
Monica Geller,"Thank you, Pheebs!"
Monica Geller,"What? You are way off, lady!"
Monica Geller,"That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!"
Monica Geller,"You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?"
Monica Geller,"No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick."
Monica Geller,"2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4."
Monica Geller,"This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year ""me""!"
Monica Geller,Did someone drop the baton again?
Monica Geller,I don't get older. I just get better!
Monica Geller,You don't know that.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"
Monica Geller,Name one of his books.
Monica Geller,"Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready..."
Monica Geller,"Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do."
Monica Geller,"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it."
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!"
Monica Geller,Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Monica Geller,Do you hear something?
Monica Geller,"Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!"
Monica Geller,Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Monica Geller,Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Monica Geller,No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Monica Geller,Nothing. It's fine.
Monica Geller,That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
Monica Geller,"Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry."
Monica Geller,Stinky?!
Monica Geller,Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Monica Geller,"Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad."
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?"
Monica Geller,Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do."
Monica Geller,It's too late for apologies.
Monica Geller,The three of us?
Monica Geller,"Joey, that is not gonna work."
Monica Geller,"Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face."
Monica Geller,Bring it.
Monica Geller,Here you go!
Monica Geller,"Okay, try it."
Monica Geller,"Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain."
Monica Geller,"Chandler, where are your tools?"
Monica Geller,"I do, but Rachel borrowed them."
Monica Geller,Oh!
Monica Geller,"Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken."
Monica Geller,I don't care.
Monica Geller,That was the adoption agency...
Monica Geller,WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Monica Geller,"There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!"
Monica Geller,This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Monica Geller,"I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,"Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby."
Monica Geller,She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Monica Geller,And a lot could still get in our way.
Monica Geller,Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Monica Geller,"You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY!"
Monica Geller,"Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?"
Monica Geller,"Uh, we're gonna be great."
Monica Geller,Well... obviously!
Monica Geller,"Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you."
Monica Geller,I don't know about that.
Monica Geller,"Let her finish, doctor."
Monica Geller,Amen.
Monica Geller,"Uh, good hands. Healing hands."
Monica Geller,"It says ""Do it!"". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good."
Monica Geller,"Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock."
Monica Geller,We don't?
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?"
Monica Geller,"Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!"
Monica Geller,Why not?
Monica Geller,God works in mysterious ways.
Monica Geller,But she liked us.
Monica Geller,"Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor."
Monica Geller,"C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now."
Monica Geller,Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Monica Geller,"I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?"
Monica Geller,"Please.. please, we are so close."
Monica Geller,"okay, right."
Monica Geller,Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Monica Geller,Technicality!
Monica Geller,I-Is... Is that a picture?
Monica Geller,"Look, doctor! Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby."
Monica Geller,"Well, we... ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend."
Monica Geller,But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Monica Geller,"Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file..."
Monica Geller,God bless you Chandler Bing!
Monica Geller,Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Monica Geller,I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Monica Geller,Sex!
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!"
Monica Geller,Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Monica Geller,Nancy doesn't smoke!
Monica Geller,So? What do you think of the house?
Monica Geller,Isn't it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Monica Geller,Don't you love the huge yard?
Monica Geller,"And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!"
Monica Geller,So? Do you think we should get it?
Monica Geller,I think we should.
Monica Geller,This is huge!
Monica Geller,"How bad you wanna smoke, right now."
Monica Geller,Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Monica Geller,Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Monica Geller,If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Monica Geller,"No, he's picking up dinner, why, what's up?"
Monica Geller,All right...
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Oh my God that's awful! What did you think of the house?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously... Did you think the neighborhood was homey?"
Monica Geller,Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Monica Geller,"Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big."
Monica Geller,"Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city."
Monica Geller,"When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city."
Monica Geller,"And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset..."
Monica Geller,"And about an hour ago, we made an offer."
Monica Geller,It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...
Monica Geller,"We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there. It is beautiful, isn't it?"
Monica Geller,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
Monica Geller,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles."
Monica Geller,Every year.
Monica Geller,"Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?"
Monica Geller,"I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?"
Monica Geller,Deal! TIME LAPSE.
Monica Geller,Maurice.
Monica Geller,"It's umm, it has something to do with transponding."
Monica Geller,That's not even a word!
Monica Geller,NOOOOOOOOO!!!!! TIME LAPSE.
Monica Geller,"Hey, we would still be living here if hadn't gotten the question wrong!"
Monica Geller,Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Monica Geller,"I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too."
Monica Geller,"Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"""
Monica Geller,What?!
Monica Geller,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like."
Monica Geller,"When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror."
Monica Geller,"When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket."
Monica Geller,"And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! TIME LAPSE."
Monica Geller,She really left.
Monica Geller,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Can I ask you a question?
Monica Geller,What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Monica Geller,And?
Monica Geller,We can't afford that.
Monica Geller,"Well, there you go."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we'll be okay."
Monica Geller,"I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much."
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Monica Geller,And a baby...
Monica Geller,We sure are.
Monica Geller,Not it!
Monica Geller,"Rachel, this is yours."
Monica Geller,"All right, everybody open them!"
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,Enjoy!
Monica Geller,"Hey, let me tell them!"
Monica Geller,Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Monica Geller,"Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship."
Monica Geller,"Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!"
Monica Geller,"Or ""Win, Lose or Draw""."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party."
Monica Geller,Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends."
Monica Geller,"""I'm a little bit country""..."
Monica Geller,"Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!"
Monica Geller,Who is it?
Monica Geller,"What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?"
Monica Geller,"Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,..."
Monica Geller,...If-you-say-so.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!"
Monica Geller,"Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir..."
Monica Geller,I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
Monica Geller,"Hey, you've got a boyfriend!"
Monica Geller,"Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!"
Monica Geller,I KNOW!
Monica Geller,Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
Monica Geller,Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Monica Geller,Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Monica Geller,That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
Monica Geller,"For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing."
Monica Geller,Oh THATS ME!
Monica Geller,She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Monica Geller,What? When was this?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! That's wild!
Monica Geller,"Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed."
Monica Geller,"OH! Oh, oh!"
Monica Geller,YES!
Monica Geller,I was the pile of coats!
Monica Geller,You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Monica Geller,You were my first kiss ever?
Monica Geller,"Oh, crap!"
Monica Geller,"Well, it matters to me!"
Monica Geller,"Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours."
Monica Geller,You don't know military time?
Monica Geller,Just subtract twelve.
Monica Geller,Six o'clock!
Monica Geller,"Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?"
Monica Geller,"Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white."
Monica Geller,Ooh... she backed out.
Monica Geller,"I made her. Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent."
Monica Geller,"Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!"
Monica Geller,"Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!"
Monica Geller,"Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!"
Monica Geller,"Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast."
Monica Geller,"You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!"
Monica Geller,"It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say."
Monica Geller,oh God.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,"Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back."
Monica Geller,"Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages."
Monica Geller,"Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine."
Monica Geller,Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Monica Geller,Hi.
Monica Geller,"She's in her room, why?"
Monica Geller,I know. .
Monica Geller,Bye.
Monica Geller,"Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle."
Monica Geller,How's it going?
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,You really want me to come back?
Monica Geller,"Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything."
Monica Geller,Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Monica Geller,"Well, the club lost it's power."
Monica Geller,AFFIRMATIVE!
Monica Geller,"OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?"
Monica Geller,"Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it."
Monica Geller,Really?
Monica Geller,"Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle."
Monica Geller,"Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position. Chandler, come with me."
Monica Geller,"Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away."
Monica Geller,"So, you're ready to do this?"
Monica Geller,"I love you. Oh, wait, wait, wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell."
Monica Geller,I love you.
Monica Geller,Okay. It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Monica Geller,I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Monica Geller,"Okay Marjorie, hit it."
Monica Geller,"Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! Oh, that's me."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?"
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour."
Monica Geller,Hey.
Monica Geller,"No, we haven't seen her since this morning."
Monica Geller,Hey!
Monica Geller,These are for Erica!
Monica Geller,"Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!"
Monica Geller,"Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building..."
Monica Geller,"Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?"
Monica Geller,Honey.
Monica Geller,Hey you guys.
Monica Geller,"I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!"
Monica Geller,"Joey. Erica, baby!"
Monica Geller,"Everyone. Erica, baby!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming."
Monica Geller,What is with you?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing."
Monica Geller,Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Monica Geller,How's that now?
Monica Geller,Was he falsely accused of something?
Monica Geller,Are you awake?
Monica Geller,"Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy."
Monica Geller,"Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?"
Monica Geller,How?
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting."
Monica Geller,"Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is."
Monica Geller,No it's not.
Monica Geller,The thing we never do.
Monica Geller,"Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away."
Monica Geller,"Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here."
Monica Geller,"No one wanted seconds, right?"
Monica Geller,I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Monica Geller,"No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this."
Monica Geller,Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Monica Geller,I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Monica Geller,"All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house."
Monica Geller,"Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us."
Monica Geller,See you guys later.
Monica Geller,I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Monica Geller,Hey Pheebs.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan."
Monica Geller,Phoebe!
Monica Geller,You seriously changed your name to that?
Monica Geller,"Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?"
Monica Geller,Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Monica Geller,But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Monica Geller,Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Monica Geller,"Ah, so glad you decided to come."
Monica Geller,No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Monica Geller,Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Monica Geller,No it's not!
Monica Geller,"Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here."
Monica Geller,"Joey, we know that's you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences."
Monica Geller,"Hey, where have you been?"
Monica Geller,"Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?"
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Monica Geller,"So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute."
Monica Geller,Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Monica Geller,"Oh, sorry!"
Monica Geller,"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive..."
Monica Geller,"I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job."
Monica Geller,How is that gonna happen?
Monica Geller,You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Monica Geller,"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't."
Monica Geller,But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Monica Geller,That's terrible!
Monica Geller,Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
Monica Geller,"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
Monica Geller,What if he reads it in the paper?
Monica Geller,"Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around."
Monica Geller,Thanks.
Monica Geller,"Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!"
Monica Geller,Love it!
Monica Geller,"They could be our neighbors, what are they like?"
Monica Geller,"No, actually, we're buying the house next door."
Monica Geller,I don't know why.
Monica Geller,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will."
Monica Geller,"Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house."
Monica Geller,"Okay, you come up with an idea."
Monica Geller,But we love our house.
Monica Geller,"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body."
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it."
Monica Geller,"Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Monica Geller,"Here, let me help you."
Monica Geller,"Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?"
Monica Geller,"You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?"
Monica Geller,"Okay, well, stop staring at them."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel."
Monica Geller,Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Monica Geller,Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Monica Geller,"Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it takes two incomes."
Monica Geller,"Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room."
Monica Geller,"Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie."
Monica Geller,"Are, are you kidding? This is packing?"
Monica Geller,From?
Monica Geller,"All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!"
Monica Geller,Hey! Where's Mike?
Monica Geller,"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange."
Monica Geller,Yeah.
Monica Geller,"Come here, I'll make you a drink."
Monica Geller,Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.
Monica Geller,What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Monica Geller,"That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before."
Monica Geller,Rachel used to live in that room.
Monica Geller,Joey's bare ass!
Monica Geller,Yeah?
Monica Geller,Sure.
Monica Geller,No.
Monica Geller,I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Monica Geller,You're the best friend I ever had.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,That is so sweet.
Monica Geller,"So, I guess you're next. You're ready?"
Monica Geller,You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Monica Geller,"Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit."
Monica Geller,Yeah. Mine too.
Monica Geller,"And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that."
Monica Geller,I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Monica Geller,"Uh, where do you think you're going?"
Monica Geller,We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Monica Geller,Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Monica Geller,"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?"
Monica Geller,"Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong."
Monica Geller,You did? How?
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Let me see.
Monica Geller,Nana liked it rough!
Monica Geller,"Erica, are you okay?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor."
Monica Geller,"All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better."
Monica Geller,"Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone."
Monica Geller,"Erica, are you okay?"
Monica Geller,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Monica Geller,"Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good."
Monica Geller,"No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?"
Monica Geller,"Alright, I'll be right back."
Monica Geller,To use the bathroom.
Monica Geller,What?
Monica Geller,What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Monica Geller,"You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes."
Monica Geller,"It's just a little bit more, honey."
Monica Geller,"Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!"
Monica Geller,It's a... It's a boy!
Monica Geller,"Oh, you did it!"
Monica Geller,"Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! Oh, we are so lucky!"
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much."
Monica Geller,"I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?"
Monica Geller,We only ordered one!
Monica Geller,"Wait, did you know it was twins?"
Monica Geller,Anybody tell you?
Monica Geller,This is unbelievable.
Monica Geller,"What do you mean ""what do we do""?"
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you're panicking!"
Monica Geller,We can't split them up!
Monica Geller,"Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?"
Monica Geller,"Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt."
Monica Geller,"That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of ""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!"
Monica Geller,Okay!
Monica Geller,Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Monica Geller,There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Monica Geller,"Son of a gun, it is!"
Monica Geller,"Okay, well, bye!"
Monica Geller,We'll call you!
Monica Geller,"Oh, look at these little bunnies!"
Monica Geller,Okay.
Monica Geller,"Alright, let's see.."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm good."
Monica Geller,"Yes, it's twins!"
Monica Geller,"This is a boy, and that's a girl."
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad."
Monica Geller,I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Monica Geller,I love you.
Monica Geller,Call us when you get there.
Monica Geller,"Now, that you can do."
Monica Geller,"Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces."
Monica Geller,"Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins."
Monica Geller,Oh God! What did I just step on?
Monica Geller,Oh..
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor."
Monica Geller,Hello.
Monica Geller,"Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen."
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before."
Monica Geller,"Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again."
Monica Geller,Isn't that cute?
Monica Geller,"Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40."
Monica Geller,"That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport."
Monica Geller,"Newark airport. Why, where are you?"
Monica Geller,Hey! Did you find them?
Monica Geller,"Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!"
Monica Geller,Alright. My job here is done.
Monica Geller,"Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later."
Monica Geller,"Well, that's it. Everything's packed."
Monica Geller,I know.
Monica Geller,I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
Monica Geller,"Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful."
Monica Geller,"If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing."
Monica Geller,"Oh, yeah, that's true."
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?"
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys."
Monica Geller,This is harder than I thought it would be.
Monica Geller,We got some time.
