speaker,transcript
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck..."
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,"No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?"
Ross Geller,"I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
Ross Geller,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
Ross Geller,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
Ross Geller,"I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well."
Ross Geller,Sorry.
Ross Geller,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Ross Geller,You can see where he'd have trouble.
Ross Geller,"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
Ross Geller,He finally asked you out?
Ross Geller,That'd be good...
Ross Geller,"No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!"
Ross Geller,A wandering?
Ross Geller,"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?"
Ross Geller,"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
Ross Geller,"Okay, sure."
Ross Geller,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
Ross Geller,"This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
Ross Geller,You guys.
Ross Geller,I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Ross Geller,That only took me an hour.
Ross Geller,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
Ross Geller,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Ross Geller,"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?"
Ross Geller,"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?"
Ross Geller,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Ross Geller,You got a job?
Ross Geller,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Ross Geller,"Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!"
Ross Geller,"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,..."
Ross Geller,"No. No, I gotta go home sometime."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Mmm. Oh, no-"
Ross Geller,"No no no, go-"
Ross Geller,Split it?
Ross Geller,"Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
Ross Geller,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Ross Geller,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
Ross Geller,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
Ross Geller,Goodnight.
Ross Geller,I just grabbed a spoon.
Ross Geller,There's an image.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."
Ross Geller,"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?"
Ross Geller,Does she.
Ross Geller,"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
Ross Geller,No. No.
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
Ross Geller,"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh..."
Ross Geller,"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?"
Ross Geller,"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
Ross Geller,Pregnant?!
Ross Geller,.....Hi.
Ross Geller,Carol's pregnant.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now."
Ross Geller,"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me."
Ross Geller,"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow."
Ross Geller,"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father."
Ross Geller,"I- I think they're great! I, I really do."
Ross Geller,"Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?"
Ross Geller,"Aw, Mom..."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Ross Geller,"Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
Ross Geller,"Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer."
Ross Geller,"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem."
Ross Geller,"Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby."
Ross Geller,"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done."
Ross Geller,Must pee.
Ross Geller,...How long was I in there?
Ross Geller,D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Ross Geller,"Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?"
Ross Geller,Mm-hmm..
Ross Geller,Mm.
Ross Geller,"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
Ross Geller,Got me.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes!"
Ross Geller,Me either...
Ross Geller,"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway."
Ross Geller,How could I forget?
Ross Geller,"Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
Ross Geller,..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Ross Geller,"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh."
Ross Geller,"Quack, quack.."
Ross Geller,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
Ross Geller,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
Ross Geller,Marlon?!
Ross Geller,...As in Mouse?
Ross Geller,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?"
Ross Geller,"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?"
Ross Geller,Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Ross Geller,Thank you!
Ross Geller,"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
Ross Geller,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
Ross Geller,"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too."
Ross Geller,"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch."
Ross Geller,"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-"
Ross Geller,"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now."
Ross Geller,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,Well? Isn't that amazing?
Ross Geller,"Then don't do that, alright?"
Ross Geller,Monica. Whaddya think?
Ross Geller,Wh- are you welling up?
Ross Geller,"You are, you're welling up."
Ross Geller,You're gonna be an aunt.
Ross Geller,"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
Ross Geller,"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm."
Ross Geller,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
Ross Geller,Can I use.. either thumb?
Ross Geller,Easy.
Ross Geller,What is this?!
Ross Geller,"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
Ross Geller,"Hey, Pheebs."
Ross Geller,"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him."
Ross Geller,...What shoe?
Ross Geller,...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Ross Geller,"You know what I like most about him, though?"
Ross Geller,The way he makes me feel about myself.
Ross Geller,Well..
Ross Geller,"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
Ross Geller,A thumb?!
Ross Geller,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
Ross Geller,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
Ross Geller,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Ross Geller,If only he were a woman.
Ross Geller,Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Ross Geller,There y'go.
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, I might!"
Ross Geller,Is there somebody else?
Ross Geller,"Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were."
Ross Geller,"Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time."
Ross Geller,Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Ross Geller,So how'd it go?
Ross Geller,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?"
Ross Geller,"Joey, uh- OMnipotent."
Ross Geller,I cannot sleep in a public place.
Ross Geller,"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again."
Ross Geller,Why?
Ross Geller,"Funny, my birthday was seven months ago."
Ross Geller,"So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?"
Ross Geller,Ohhh.
Ross Geller,"Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover."
Ross Geller,What are you doing?
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?"
Ross Geller,"You can totally, totally live on this."
Ross Geller,"Oh, by the way, great service tonight."
Ross Geller,"Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry."
Ross Geller,Peach pit.
Ross Geller,"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
Ross Geller,"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
Ross Geller,"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine."
Ross Geller,"Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh."
Ross Geller,"No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost..."
Ross Geller,"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!"
Ross Geller,Pass it! Pass it!
Ross Geller,"Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented."
Ross Geller,"Hey, this- Heyy..."
Ross Geller,I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Ross Geller,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
Ross Geller,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
Ross Geller,My first time with Carol was...
Ross Geller,It was my first time.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?"
Ross Geller,"The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck."
Ross Geller,"'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!"
Ross Geller,GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Ross Geller,...Now that was fun.
Ross Geller,"Okay, Monica: Right foot red."
Ross Geller,"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good."
Ross Geller,Green. To the green.
Ross Geller,"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
Ross Geller,Multiple orgasms!
Ross Geller,"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
Ross Geller,Tony?
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
Ross Geller,"That guy, he burns me up."
Ross Geller,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?"
Ross Geller,"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?"
Ross Geller,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
Ross Geller,"Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
Ross Geller,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Ross Geller,Nuh-uh.
Ross Geller,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way."
Ross Geller,What's goin' on?
Ross Geller,Was your basket on top?
Ross Geller,So?
Ross Geller,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine."
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
Ross Geller,"All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry."
Ross Geller,"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
Ross Geller,"Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
Ross Geller,"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
Ross Geller,"Rach, have you never done this before?"
Ross Geller,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
Ross Geller,"Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
Ross Geller,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh."
Ross Geller,"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
Ross Geller,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
Ross Geller,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
Ross Geller,You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Ross Geller,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
Ross Geller,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
Ross Geller,"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen."
Ross Geller,Is it? Feels like two.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Oh. Hel-lo!
Ross Geller,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Ross Geller,C'mon! C'mon!
Ross Geller,"No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is."
Ross Geller,"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-"
Ross Geller,"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
Ross Geller,"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
Ross Geller,"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!"
Ross Geller,"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away."
Ross Geller,Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Ross Geller,Monica? You're Mom.
Ross Geller,"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
Ross Geller,"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?"
Ross Geller,"Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?"
Ross Geller,"No? What happened, big guy?"
Ross Geller,It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?"
Ross Geller,She is a kook.
Ross Geller,"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
Ross Geller,That's my sister.
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, what about you?"
Ross Geller,"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
Ross Geller,"The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom."
Ross Geller,Step back.
Ross Geller,"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
Ross Geller,Come on.
Ross Geller,And you didn't marry him because...?
Ross Geller,"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated."
Ross Geller,"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff."
Ross Geller,"But, um... I don't think that's going to be you."
Ross Geller,"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future."
Ross Geller,Mmmm.
Ross Geller,I do.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What? Why not?
Ross Geller,"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone."
Ross Geller,"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
Ross Geller,"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?"
Ross Geller,Shhhh!
Ross Geller,We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
Ross Geller,See?
Ross Geller,"OK, here goes."
Ross Geller,I'm going to do it.
Ross Geller,"You come out there, you're a dead man."
Ross Geller,Thanks. OK.
Ross Geller,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
Ross Geller,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
Ross Geller,What? Ow!
Ross Geller,Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Lucky sixes....
Ross Geller,"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
Ross Geller,"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
Ross Geller,"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him."
Ross Geller,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
Ross Geller,Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Ross Geller,That's... that's classic.
Ross Geller,Paolo. Hi.
Ross Geller,"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing."
Ross Geller,"Thing, yes. Thing."
Ross Geller,"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um..."
Ross Geller,"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad."
Ross Geller,Yeah! Se vice?
Ross Geller,So you do know a little English.
Ross Geller,Do you know the word crapweasel?
Ross Geller,"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Ross Geller,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
Ross Geller,Oh.. oh... oh.
Ross Geller,"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did."
Ross Geller,"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
Ross Geller,So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Ross Geller,"So, uh, how's she doing?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
Ross Geller,"Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
Ross Geller,"Not just restaurants, from our house."
Ross Geller,She looks so small.
Ross Geller,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now."
Ross Geller,"Bye, Nana."
Ross Geller,"Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.."
Ross Geller,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
Ross Geller,She may have died.
Ross Geller,We're looking into it.
Ross Geller,"I, uh, I'll go see."
Ross Geller,Now she's passed.
Ross Geller,Twice.
Ross Geller,"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh..."
Ross Geller,"Nono, she's gone."
Ross Geller,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Ross Geller,I don't see why not.
Ross Geller,Here's my retainer!
Ross Geller,I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Ross Geller,"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea."
Ross Geller,"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun."
Ross Geller,"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
Ross Geller,"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
Ross Geller,I'd like that.
Ross Geller,This one?
Ross Geller,"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy."
Ross Geller,Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Ross Geller,"Okay. Um, how about these?"
Ross Geller,And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Ross Geller,"Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work."
Ross Geller,"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back."
Ross Geller,Oh my God..
Ross Geller,"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
Ross Geller,"How we doing, you guys ready?"
Ross Geller,Some days it's all I can think about.
Ross Geller,"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
Ross Geller,"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-"
Ross Geller,I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Ross Geller,"What, what is it?"
Ross Geller,Oh! No-n-
Ross Geller,"I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great."
Ross Geller,"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs..."
Ross Geller,...Chandler!
Ross Geller,"And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me."
Ross Geller,Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Oh.. you don't get it!
Ross Geller,Whaddya got there?
Ross Geller,What's the score?
Ross Geller,Beautiful!
Ross Geller,Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Ross Geller,That little naked guy would be me.
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
Ross Geller,Got me.
Ross Geller,Looks like a fun gang.
Ross Geller,"Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."
Ross Geller,"No, they're not."
Ross Geller,You're wrong.
Ross Geller,You're wrong.
Ross Geller,I'm calling Mom.
Ross Geller,"Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving."
Ross Geller,Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm off to Carol's."
Ross Geller,"Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
Ross Geller,"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in."
Ross Geller,"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
Ross Geller,Kinda like a big face without skin.
Ross Geller,"Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
Ross Geller,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?"
Ross Geller,"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
Ross Geller,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I hate this story."
Ross Geller,I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Ross Geller,That's closer.
Ross Geller,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
Ross Geller,"Ok, Mom never hit."
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid."
Ross Geller,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
Ross Geller,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
Ross Geller,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
Ross Geller,"Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
Ross Geller,"Does it always, uh--?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts."
Ross Geller,"Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's."
Ross Geller,I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Ross Geller,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
Ross Geller,Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Ross Geller,'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Ross Geller,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
Ross Geller,"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'."
Ross Geller,How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Ross Geller,"Come here, Marcel. Sit here."
Ross Geller,Just a smidge.
Ross Geller,"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
Ross Geller,"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
Ross Geller,So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Ross Geller,"Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
Ross Geller,Four.
Ross Geller,Five.
Ross Geller,"Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands..."
Ross Geller,Really.
Ross Geller,"What, uh... what juggling thing?"
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Par-tay!
Ross Geller,"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?"
Ross Geller,Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Ross Geller,"Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
Ross Geller,"Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
Ross Geller,Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Ross Geller,"I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back."
Ross Geller,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
Ross Geller,"Oh, please..."
Ross Geller,When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Ross Geller,"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew."
Ross Geller,What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Ross Geller,"Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy."
Ross Geller,...But a man can change.
Ross Geller,Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine."
Ross Geller,Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Ross Geller,No. It's the one he's licking.
Ross Geller,You're good.
Ross Geller,The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Ross Geller,When?
Ross Geller,The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Ross Geller,Please.
Ross Geller,Right.
Ross Geller,Uh-oh...
Ross Geller,"Hey, is Chandler here?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,What code?
Ross Geller,"Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
Ross Geller,"No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
Ross Geller,"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's..."
Ross Geller,Well... not in the same way...
Ross Geller,"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Well, not playing raquetball!"
Ross Geller,He didn't get the goggles!
Ross Geller,Do they wait for me to do this?
Ross Geller,Why would I tell him?
Ross Geller,Oh...
Ross Geller,You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
Ross Geller,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
Ross Geller,"Thanks, man, big help."
Ross Geller,"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
Ross Geller,I know-
Ross Geller,Chandler-
Ross Geller,Chandler-
Ross Geller,Joey-
Ross Geller,I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Ross Geller,"Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a..."
Ross Geller,"Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
Ross Geller,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
Ross Geller,We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Ross Geller,"No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!"
Ross Geller,"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
Ross Geller,You're kidding.
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,"'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
Ross Geller,"So, what's going on now?"
Ross Geller,Whaddya see?
Ross Geller,Mrs. Bing.
Ross Geller,You mean that?
Ross Geller,Yeah? How'd it go?
Ross Geller,"Well, howdya feel?"
Ross Geller,"Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road."
Ross Geller,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
Ross Geller,"Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!"
Ross Geller,Hello!
Ross Geller,"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?"
Ross Geller,"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna."
Ross Geller,I'm pretty sure that it is...
Ross Geller,"Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's great, that is great!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
Ross Geller,Of course it's your friend Tanya.
Ross Geller,"The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't..."
Ross Geller,Susan...
Ross Geller,"Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!"
Ross Geller,"Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go."
Ross Geller,"No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan..."
Ross Geller,"Uh, never mind, I don't want to know."
Ross Geller,"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
Ross Geller,"Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
Ross Geller,Hi Pheebs!
Ross Geller,"I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
Ross Geller,My God.
Ross Geller,The actress!
Ross Geller,Thanks Rach.
Ross Geller,"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well..."
Ross Geller,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Ross Geller,"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
Ross Geller,"Come on, two on one."
Ross Geller,"What, now?"
Ross Geller,How's it going?
Ross Geller,"Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say..."
Ross Geller,"Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed..."
Ross Geller,...and I really think it should be me.
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,You all right?
Ross Geller,"Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Huh.
Ross Geller,Ohhhh
Ross Geller,"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process."
Ross Geller,"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
Ross Geller,"Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?"
Ross Geller,"I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"
Ross Geller,I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Ross Geller,I'm having a son. Um...
Ross Geller,You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad."
Ross Geller,"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?"
Ross Geller,Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Ross Geller,That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Ross Geller,"Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying..."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!"
Ross Geller,"I dunno, there's just something about..."
Ross Geller,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
Ross Geller,"So Joey, you okay?"
Ross Geller,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Ross Geller,She lent me an egg once.
Ross Geller,"Aw, right."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,An egg?
Ross Geller,I think it's insane.
Ross Geller,Hi. She said yes.
Ross Geller,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
Ross Geller,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
Ross Geller,If you wanna put a label on it.
Ross Geller,"Nope, nope, that's it."
Ross Geller,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!"
Ross Geller,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
Ross Geller,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
Ross Geller,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Ross Geller,"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
Ross Geller,"You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?"
Ross Geller,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Ross Geller,"Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot."
Ross Geller,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
Ross Geller,"No but, no but."
Ross Geller,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
Ross Geller,Grazie.
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
Ross Geller,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
Ross Geller,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
Ross Geller,Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey."
Ross Geller,"Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh."
Ross Geller,"Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel..."
Ross Geller,Alright...
Ross Geller,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
Ross Geller,"Wha... what, here?"
Ross Geller,Ah....
Ross Geller,Er.... um.....
Ross Geller,Um... uh.... vulva.
Ross Geller,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
Ross Geller,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?"
Ross Geller,Please be kidding.
Ross Geller,OK. I'm in my apartment...
Ross Geller,"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation."
Ross Geller,"Joey, please."
Ross Geller,Wow.
Ross Geller,I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Sure.
Ross Geller,"OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this."
Ross Geller,"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips."
Ross Geller,"I, er..."
Ross Geller,I want to take my tongue... and...
Ross Geller,....and....
Ross Geller,...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Ross Geller,Funny story!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I was unbelievable."
Ross Geller,"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
Ross Geller,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, which was nice."
Ross Geller,"I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, ""supposedly"" by accident."
Ross Geller,"And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword."
Ross Geller,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class."
Ross Geller,"No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team."
Ross Geller,"No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation."
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Hi, um, Im err, Im Ross Geller, and err ah... ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... ..whos next?"
Ross Geller,"Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend..."
Ross Geller,Like buddies.
Ross Geller,You know how close women can get.
Ross Geller,Although I was married to her.
Ross Geller,"Err, right."
Ross Geller,A little.
Ross Geller,"Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch."
Ross Geller,It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross Geller,"Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote..."
Ross Geller,"Relax, I'll fix it."
Ross Geller,How did he do this?
Ross Geller,You okay?
Ross Geller,You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Ross Geller,Sorry.
Ross Geller,"Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?"
Ross Geller,"No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on."
Ross Geller,What? What? What?
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
Ross Geller,I see. So what do you propose to do?
Ross Geller,"Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!"
Ross Geller,"Susan, go deep."
Ross Geller,"Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright."
Ross Geller,Im gonna be a father.
Ross Geller,"I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me."
Ross Geller,"Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?"
Ross Geller,"No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt."
Ross Geller,I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Ross Geller,"No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me."
Ross Geller,"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field."
Ross Geller,"Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father."
Ross Geller,Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Ross Geller,Tonight.
Ross Geller,You take your time.
Ross Geller,What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
Ross Geller,"Oh, we just..."
Ross Geller,"I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say ""get out of my office!"""
Ross Geller,"Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
Ross Geller,"I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;"
Ross Geller,"Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
Ross Geller,No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Ross Geller,"No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
Ross Geller,'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Ross Geller,"Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew."
Ross Geller,So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Ross Geller,"No, we can go to Williamsburg."
Ross Geller,Eat your fish.
Ross Geller,Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Ross Geller,Maybe not.
Ross Geller,Well did you try calling her?
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,Do you have a point?
Ross Geller,It's just a fur ball.
Ross Geller,"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
Ross Geller,I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
Ross Geller,You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
Ross Geller,"No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do."
Ross Geller,"Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!"
Ross Geller,He looks so tiny.
Ross Geller,Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Ross Geller,"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
Ross Geller,"No, why?"
Ross Geller,"hey, fella! How you doing?"
Ross Geller,Aqui est.
Ross Geller,Lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
Ross Geller,I don't know.
Ross Geller,"No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh..."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Who?
Ross Geller,"Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!"
Ross Geller,"We're fine, we're fine."
Ross Geller,Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Ross Geller,"Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
Ross Geller,"No, women are welcome to play."
Ross Geller,"Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?"
Ross Geller,"No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou can't do..."
Ross Geller,"No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that."
Ross Geller,"Oh, you're..."
Ross Geller,"Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy..."
Ross Geller,"The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
Ross Geller,Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Ross Geller,...Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt..."
Ross Geller,I'm not a nice guy.
Ross Geller,"Alright boys, let's eat."
Ross Geller,You still on that?
Ross Geller,"You are way off, pal."
Ross Geller,"Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one timenot any more. I justI..."
Ross Geller,Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Ross Geller,"You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble."
Ross Geller,Alright.
Ross Geller,I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
Ross Geller,Alright.
Ross Geller,"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones."
Ross Geller,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
Ross Geller,"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing."
Ross Geller,Uh... to the bathroom.
Ross Geller,I want to go to the bathroom.
Ross Geller,"Alright. : Your money's mine, Green."
Ross Geller,"Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I am very in."
Ross Geller,"No, not this time. So... what'd you have?"
Ross Geller,"Come on, show them to me."
Ross Geller,Show them to me!
Ross Geller,Let me see! Show them!
Ross Geller,"First of all, I'm not losing..."
Ross Geller,Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Ross Geller,"Mee mee, mee-mee mee."
Ross Geller,I'm in for fifty cents.
Ross Geller,"I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
Ross Geller,"No, I fold."
Ross Geller,I'm in.
Ross Geller,One.
Ross Geller,I bet two dollars.
Ross Geller,"I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five."
Ross Geller,": Joey, I'm a little shy."
Ross Geller,Fifteen.
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,": OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?"
Ross Geller,You got me.
Ross Geller,"Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is."
Ross Geller,Uh.... bean! Bean!
Ross Geller,"Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?"
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Really.
Ross Geller,"Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?"
Ross Geller,"Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there."
Ross Geller,"Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."
Ross Geller,...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Ross Geller,"Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are."
Ross Geller,"That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you."
Ross Geller,"'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there."
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me."
Ross Geller,"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
Ross Geller,"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
Ross Geller,"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
Ross Geller,"Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah. You, uh, you want some?"
Ross Geller,"Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-"
Ross Geller,"Okay, quick and painful."
Ross Geller,"Oh, what? What-what?"
Ross Geller,...Yeah?
Ross Geller,"I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment."
Ross Geller,"No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil."
Ross Geller,You called Animal Control?
Ross Geller,"Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me."
Ross Geller,"That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
Ross Geller,Cat!
Ross Geller,My uncle Marcel.
Ross Geller,Marcel?
Ross Geller,"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone."
Ross Geller,"Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."
Ross Geller,"I don't even wanna hear it, you're just..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, forget it, okay?"
Ross Geller,What? What?
Ross Geller,"Hi, did you order some bananas?"
Ross Geller,Gimme back my monkey.
Ross Geller,"Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?"
Ross Geller,Marcel! What've you done to him?
Ross Geller,"Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon."
Ross Geller,"C'mere, Marcel."
Ross Geller,"Okay, gimme my monkey back."
Ross Geller,"Alright, I want my monkey."
Ross Geller,"You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat."
Ross Geller,"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
Ross Geller,"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?"
Ross Geller,"Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
Ross Geller,We have got to start locking that door!
Ross Geller,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
Ross Geller,I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, what's going on?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?"
Ross Geller,What? What? What?!
Ross Geller,"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
Ross Geller,"That's, that's nice twice!"
Ross Geller,What was with the dishes?
Ross Geller,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
Ross Geller,You-you had what?
Ross Geller,"What, uh... what were you thinking?"
Ross Geller,"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
Ross Geller,"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
Ross Geller,"I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?"
Ross Geller,"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,"""Heating device."""
Ross Geller,Five letters.
Ross Geller,I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Ross Geller,Second date!
Ross Geller,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind."
Ross Geller,"Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-"
Ross Geller,"What? It's, it's just a phase."
Ross Geller,Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,At the vet.
Ross Geller,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Ross Geller,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
Ross Geller,I'm gonna have to give him up.
Ross Geller,"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
Ross Geller,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
Ross Geller,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility."
Ross Geller,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
Ross Geller,"Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him."
Ross Geller,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"
Ross Geller,Where exactly is your zoo?
Ross Geller,Yes.
Ross Geller,"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
Ross Geller,"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
Ross Geller,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
Ross Geller,Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Ross Geller,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
Ross Geller,"Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe."
Ross Geller,"Just, just say what you feel."
Ross Geller,That was good.
Ross Geller,"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
Ross Geller,"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."
Ross Geller,"Why, why, why would you dream that?"
Ross Geller,"I love it, when we share."
Ross Geller,I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's my new beeper."
Ross Geller,"No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
Ross Geller,College?
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye."
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh Chandler..."
Ross Geller,'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Ross Geller,"Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way."
Ross Geller,"Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there."
Ross Geller,"You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?"
Ross Geller,Huh!
Ross Geller,Are you not seeing him anymore?
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah."
Ross Geller,It's morphin time!
Ross Geller,"Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
Ross Geller,"Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
Ross Geller,I thought that was just a rumour.
Ross Geller,Are you're hands still wet?
Ross Geller,I'm here.
Ross Geller,"What? Great, now I'm having a baby."
Ross Geller,"Ooh, Ooh."
Ross Geller,I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Ross Geller,I'm hurt.
Ross Geller,"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, save it for the cab, okay."
Ross Geller,What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Ross Geller,"Joey, get out of the fridge."
Ross Geller,What is that?
Ross Geller,Save it.
Ross Geller,"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."
Ross Geller,"That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on."
Ross Geller,She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Ross Geller,"I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug."
Ross Geller,"God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
Ross Geller,She's not even here yet.
Ross Geller,Where the hell have you been?
Ross Geller,"Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys."
Ross Geller,Stopped for a Chunky.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"Dr. Franzblau, hi."
Ross Geller,"59 seconds. Quartz, ha."
Ross Geller,I'll get it.
Ross Geller,I got itI'm getting it!
Ross Geller,Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Ross Geller,Breathe.
Ross Geller,Breathe.
Ross Geller,Breathe.
Ross Geller,"15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
Ross Geller,Who the hell is Jordie?
Ross Geller,"No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
Ross Geller,"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco."
Ross Geller,I got it.
Ross Geller,"I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
Ross Geller,Why?
Ross Geller,"No, you started it."
Ross Geller,But...
Ross Geller,Thanks a lot.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, listen..."
Ross Geller,Please. This is so your fault.
Ross Geller,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
Ross Geller,You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, Susan."
Ross Geller,"I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow."
Ross Geller,Help! Help!
Ross Geller,Help!
Ross Geller,"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
Ross Geller,"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
Ross Geller,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Ross Geller,You wanna explain that?
Ross Geller,"Ok, got the vent open."
Ross Geller,"Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
Ross Geller,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
Ross Geller,We're here!
Ross Geller,"Long story, honey."
Ross Geller,"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?"
Ross Geller,"Hello! Oh, sorry."
Ross Geller,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
Ross Geller,"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o."
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
Ross Geller,How 'bout Ben?
Ross Geller,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
Ross Geller,"The head, the head. You gotta..."
Ross Geller,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this."
Ross Geller,"No, this is pretty much it."
Ross Geller,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
Ross Geller,And here's little Ben nodding off...
Ross Geller,That would be nice.
Ross Geller,What kind of research?
Ross Geller,"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,I'm going to China.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me..."
Ross Geller,": Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left."
Ross Geller,"Oh. Hey, who's Carl?"
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"At the coffeehouse, right."
Ross Geller,"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,....I have to go to China.
Ross Geller,"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?"
Ross Geller,"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
Ross Geller,"Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?"
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,
Ross Geller,Ni-chou chi-ma!
Ross Geller,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Ross Geller,"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
Ross Geller,"Can't do it, can you?"
Ross Geller,"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
Ross Geller,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
Ross Geller,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
Ross Geller,"No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?"
Ross Geller,"Well, start looking."
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
Ross Geller,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
Ross Geller,"Come on, they're gonna love you."
Ross Geller,Rach!
Ross Geller,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
Ross Geller,You're bleeding.
Ross Geller,"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
Ross Geller,"That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?"
Ross Geller,"Everyone, this is Julie."
Ross Geller,And bus.
Ross Geller,The screaming guy?
Ross Geller,You gotta hear this story.
Ross Geller,200 at least.
Ross Geller,"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig."
Ross Geller,"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time."
Ross Geller,"Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
Ross Geller,"It was you, pal."
Ross Geller,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
Ross Geller,I didn't order lemonade.
Ross Geller,But...
Ross Geller,"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym."
Ross Geller,Hello? Hi.
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either."
Ross Geller,"Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y..."
Ross Geller,Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Ross Geller,"Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected..."
Ross Geller,"Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching."
Ross Geller,"Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?"
Ross Geller,"So, uh, he's back."
Ross Geller,"No, not a problem."
Ross Geller,How's the hair?
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?"
Ross Geller,"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten."
Ross Geller,"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,What's goin' on?
Ross Geller,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
Ross Geller,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that."
Ross Geller,"You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?"
Ross Geller,Okay. Okay. Okay.
Ross Geller,What are you guys doing?
Ross Geller,"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world."
Ross Geller,"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
Ross Geller,Carol?
Ross Geller,"Hi, honey."
Ross Geller,Hello to the rest.
Ross Geller,"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"
Ross Geller,"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
Ross Geller,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son."
Ross Geller,My mommies love me. That's clever.
Ross Geller,"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
Ross Geller,It's breast milk.
Ross Geller,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Ross Geller,I did not freak out.
Ross Geller,Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Ross Geller,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults."
Ross Geller,That would be no.
Ross Geller,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Ross Geller,"Oh, you've tasted it."
Ross Geller,Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Ross Geller,That's not bad.
Ross Geller,"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."
Ross Geller,Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
Ross Geller,We'll give you Janice.
Ross Geller,"Sure, sweepin'. You never know."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
Ross Geller,You don't believe in evolution?
Ross Geller,"Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?"
Ross Geller,"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity."
Ross Geller,"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?"
Ross Geller,How can you not believe in evolution?
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time."
Ross Geller,"You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over."
Ross Geller,"Well, there you go."
Ross Geller,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?"
Ross Geller,Please tell me you're joking.
Ross Geller,"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--"
Ross Geller,Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Ross Geller,"You remember Janice, right?"
Ross Geller,"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old."
Ross Geller,"It's the only possibility, Phoebe."
Ross Geller,"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,You comin'?
Ross Geller,"You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental."
Ross Geller,"Whip it out, whip it out."
Ross Geller,"Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?"
Ross Geller,You were in a porno?
Ross Geller,So what's it shaped like?
Ross Geller,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
Ross Geller,"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?"
Ross Geller,"OK sweetie, I'll see you later."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Hey?
Ross Geller,Can I ask you somethin'?
Ross Geller,Naa.
Ross Geller,"OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?"
Ross Geller,"Technically, huh, no."
Ross Geller,"No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . ."
Ross Geller,"It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Sexy?
Ross Geller,No kidding?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,You'd wait?
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,Women really want this?
Ross Geller,"Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks."
Ross Geller,Hi everyone.
Ross Geller,"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
Ross Geller,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
Ross Geller,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . ."
Ross Geller,Pop it in.
Ross Geller,What's wrong with people having sex?
Ross Geller,Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Ross Geller,Goodnight.
Ross Geller,"Oh, no no, I am."
Ross Geller,"Um, no, I uh, I have done it before."
Ross Geller,"I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens."
Ross Geller,"Wha, uhh, what?"
Ross Geller,"OK, now I'm nervous."
Ross Geller,"No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know."
Ross Geller,"What, it's not your fault."
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,"Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight."
Ross Geller,Good morning.
Ross Geller,Twice.
Ross Geller,"Man, I sure miss Julie."
Ross Geller,You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob."""
Ross Geller,Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico."
Ross Geller,"Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?"
Ross Geller,I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Ross Geller,"That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness."
Ross Geller,Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
Ross Geller,Go.
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--"
Ross Geller,Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Ross Geller,"Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--"
Ross Geller,"That's fine, I'll just wait!"
Ross Geller,Monica!
Ross Geller,"Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?"
Ross Geller,That sounds great. Same for me.
Ross Geller,"Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks."
Ross Geller,"Oh, you're right, I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,"Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay."
Ross Geller,"So five of us is, $33.50 apiece."
Ross Geller,"Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal."
Ross Geller,"Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine."
Ross Geller,I hear ya.
Ross Geller,"I, I just never think of money as an issue."
Ross Geller,That's a good point.
Ross Geller,"Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?"
Ross Geller,G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Ross Geller,"Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio."
Ross Geller,"No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together."
Ross Geller,Not at the concert.
Ross Geller,Whoo!
Ross Geller,"But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?"
Ross Geller,Come on.
Ross Geller,Could you be less enthused?
Ross Geller,We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Ross Geller,"I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys."
Ross Geller,Fine.
Ross Geller,Chandler!
Ross Geller,Geez! Are you ready?
Ross Geller,Whoa! You had sex today?
Ross Geller,Wow.

Ross Geller,"You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?"
Ross Geller,What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.

Ross Geller,??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
Ross Geller,"Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun."

Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,"Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?"
Ross Geller,I hope Ben has a little sister.
Ross Geller,"I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?"
Ross Geller,"They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it."
Ross Geller,"I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?"
Ross Geller,"Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?"

Ross Geller,Hi guys.
Ross Geller,"Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?"
Ross Geller,Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Ross Geller,"Uh, actually, we're getting a cat."
Ross Geller,Uh huh.
Ross Geller,Yep.

Ross Geller,Hey Rach.
Ross Geller,Oh. And how was the date?
Ross Geller,"Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?"
Ross Geller,"OK. Oh, oh, oh."
Ross Geller,"No, I stayed at Julie's last night."
Ross Geller,"Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?"
Ross Geller,"Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael?"
Ross Geller,You're over me?
Ross Geller,"Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
Ross Geller,"When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?"
Ross Geller,You've had feelings for me?
Ross Geller,"Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?"
Ross Geller,Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Ross Geller,China.
Ross Geller,"Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?"
Ross Geller,"That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie."
Ross Geller,I'll be right down.
Ross Geller,"Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat."
Ross Geller,Cat.
Ross Geller,I didn't get a cat.
Ross Geller,"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
Ross Geller,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Ross Geller,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Ross Geller,Then you should have said something before I met her.
Ross Geller,There was never a good time.
Ross Geller,"Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys."
Ross Geller,"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it."
Ross Geller,Fine.
Ross Geller,Good.
Ross Geller,Try the bottom one.
Ross Geller,"And, uh, and then I kissed her."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?"
Ross Geller,"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel."
Ross Geller,How are you?
Ross Geller,Good.
Ross Geller,"Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?"
Ross Geller,"Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?"
Ross Geller,Play it.
Ross Geller,Ssshh.
Ross Geller,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare."
Ross Geller,Can't we just use a pen?
Ross Geller,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
Ross Geller,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress."
Ross Geller,I don't know.
Ross Geller,She's not Rachel.
Ross Geller,"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's."
Ross Geller,"No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing."
Ross Geller,"Well, uh."
Ross Geller,"Really. It's always been you, Rach."
Ross Geller,"I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?"
Ross Geller,"Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat."
Ross Geller,"Hey, someone order a coat?"
Ross Geller,"He won't? He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?"
Ross Geller,That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Ross Geller,"No, you don't."
Ross Geller,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?"
Ross Geller,"Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot."
Ross Geller,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?"
Ross Geller,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column."
Ross Geller,"No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?"
Ross Geller,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!"
Ross Geller,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben."
Ross Geller,Number six: the way you smell.
Ross Geller,"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?"
Ross Geller,"I am, uh, I am..."
Ross Geller,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance."
Ross Geller,No?
Ross Geller,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel."
Ross Geller,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things."
Ross Geller,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Look, can, can you do something for me?"
Ross Geller,"So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme."
Ross Geller,Hey guys.
Ross Geller,"Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . ."
Ross Geller,"How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?"
Ross Geller,"Here, go nuts."

Ross Geller,"Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me."
Ross Geller,C'mon Rachel.
Ross Geller,"See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said."
Ross Geller,"C'mon, just tell me, please, please."
Ross Geller,"Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . ."
Ross Geller,"Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off."
Ross Geller,"No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is."
Ross Geller,"It uhh, it won't go back."
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal."
Ross Geller,"OK, tip the man."
Ross Geller,"Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon."
Ross Geller,"It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?"
Ross Geller,"Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK."
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything."
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas."
Ross Geller,"No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,You mean hardball?
Ross Geller,"Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go."

Ross Geller,"Oh you do, do you?"
Ross Geller,Of... of what?

Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,"Oh, you and me?"
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
Ross Geller,Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Ross Geller,"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!"
Ross Geller,Mmm hmmm.
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Ross Geller,Would it matter?
Ross Geller,"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?"
Ross Geller,If you wanna call that a reason.
Ross Geller,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there."
Ross Geller,Excellent!
Ross Geller,That is so good! Do it again!
Ross Geller,"No no, that's me."
Ross Geller,"Oh, hello."
Ross Geller,Is everything ok?
Ross Geller,Oh my god.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim."
Ross Geller,"Hi, Mrs. Green."
Ross Geller,And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Ross Geller,"No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing."
Ross Geller,What's the matter?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?"
Ross Geller,Oh my god.
Ross Geller,It's ok. I'm sorry.
Ross Geller,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right."
Ross Geller,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this."
Ross Geller,"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it."
Ross Geller,Any time.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, can't help but."
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"No, that's fine."
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,"Well, Mon, I was married."
Ross Geller,That commercial always makes me so sad.
Ross Geller,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Ross Geller,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away."
Ross Geller,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it."
Ross Geller,Hey guys.
Ross Geller,"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel."
Ross Geller,"Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel."
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, what happened?"
Ross Geller,I can't believe this.
Ross Geller,"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
Ross Geller,Zoo dollars?
Ross Geller,I was thinkin' about it.
Ross Geller,"Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?"
Ross Geller,"Buddy, my monkey?"
Ross Geller,Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Ross Geller,"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
Ross Geller,That guy Lipson?
Ross Geller,"No, I, I only know Lipson."
Ross Geller,"Buddy, my monkey, my monkey."
Ross Geller,Of course.
Ross Geller,This is unbelievable.
Ross Geller,Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Ross Geller,But you already told me everything.
Ross Geller,"Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey."
Ross Geller,"Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is."
Ross Geller,"Well, there goes my whole belief system."
Ross Geller,"That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin."
Ross Geller,Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Ross Geller,"Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan."
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year."
Ross Geller,"Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?"
Ross Geller,"Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together."

Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Some of your old stuff.
Ross Geller,"Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them."
Ross Geller,"Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii."
Ross Geller,"Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold."
Ross Geller,"Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha."

Ross Geller,"Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner."

Ross Geller,You're not laughing.
Ross Geller,"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Ross Geller,We're not alone.
Ross Geller,What? What's on your shoulder?
Ross Geller,"A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi."
Ross Geller,"No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?"
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'"
Ross Geller,"Alright, shall we?"
Ross Geller,"Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here."
Ross Geller,Oh thank you.
Ross Geller,Hi ma.
Ross Geller,"Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us."
Ross Geller,"C'mon, tell us."
Ross Geller,"C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously."
Ross Geller,"Dad, you really don't want to do that."
Ross Geller,"Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?"
Ross Geller,"Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster."
Ross Geller,"Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . ."
Ross Geller,"Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence."
Ross Geller,What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Ross Geller,"Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one."
Ross Geller,I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Ross Geller,"Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her."
Ross Geller,"I tell you, I've never seen him this happy."
Ross Geller,Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Ross Geller,"C'mon, it's my birthday."
Ross Geller,Who's drink can I freshen?
Ross Geller,"Mon, Mon, are you OK?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Eww.
Ross Geller,Ohh.
Ross Geller,"Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?"
Ross Geller,Found it.
Ross Geller,I'll take that dad.
Ross Geller,"That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city."
Ross Geller,You're the twinkie?
Ross Geller,Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Ross Geller,When did I say that?
Ross Geller,You got a tattoo?
Ross Geller,Lemme see.
Ross Geller,Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, save us some pizza."
Ross Geller,"Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck."

Ross Geller,"Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing."
Ross Geller,"Wha-, you have a phone in here?"
Ross Geller,Get the what?
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7."
Ross Geller,"Calm down, I'm blow drying."
Ross Geller,All yours.
Ross Geller,I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Ross Geller,Shut up.
Ross Geller,Mi-mi-mii.
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
Ross Geller,"Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated."
Ross Geller,"No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore."
Ross Geller,"No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?"
Ross Geller,"Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi."

Ross Geller,"Wha-, oh, quit it."
Ross Geller,"Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel."
Ross Geller,"Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight."
Ross Geller,"Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright."
Ross Geller,"Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids."
Ross Geller,You hated me when we were kids?
Ross Geller,Why did you hate me?
Ross Geller,And that wasn't fun for you?
Ross Geller,I can't believe you hated me.
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,I can do that.
Ross Geller,"So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Ohh... OK.

Ross Geller,"Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok."
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, what's goin' on?"
Ross Geller,"No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey."
Ross Geller,Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.

Ross Geller,"I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?"
Ross Geller,"Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-"
Ross Geller,"Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared."
Ross Geller,"Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good."
Ross Geller,"Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg."
Ross Geller,Buy mommy.
Ross Geller,"Have a good time. Ok, Ben."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula."
Ross Geller,Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine."
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,"Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try."
Ross Geller,"Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off."
Ross Geller,What're you doing?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb."
Ross Geller,Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
Ross Geller,"Ok, here, here. There we go."
Ross Geller,"It's alright, it's no big deal."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive."
Ross Geller,"Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great."
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,"Ok, what the hell happened back there?"
Ross Geller,"Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders."
Ross Geller,"C'mon, what, you never think about our future?"
Ross Geller,"No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good."
Ross Geller,The big book of childrens' names.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Ok fine.
Ross Geller,We're not done.
Ross Geller,"Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that."
Ross Geller,"Good, 'cause I love you."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Well that's the first time we've said that.
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm gonna kiss you."
Ross Geller,"Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail."
Ross Geller,Hello.
Ross Geller,Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
Ross Geller,"Wha, what?"
Ross Geller,"What, the word hi?"

Ross Geller,"Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee."
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat."
Ross Geller,"Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler..."
Ross Geller,"It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Do you say this stuff to girls?
Ross Geller,"You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door."
Ross Geller,"Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat."
Ross Geller,Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
Ross Geller,"Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice."
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys."
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,Absolutely.
Ross Geller,How come it's not mixing with the water?
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, sure."
Ross Geller,"No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'."
Ross Geller,"Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?"
Ross Geller,I think we proved our point.
Ross Geller,Cannot feel my tounge.
Ross Geller,"Yes, and that's why we're here."
Ross Geller,"Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?"
Ross Geller,Whad'ya mean?

Ross Geller,"Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that..."
Ross Geller,"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
Ross Geller,"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers."
Ross Geller,"No, Rach!"
Ross Geller,"Marenge,"
Ross Geller,Everybody!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind."
Ross Geller,"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes ."

Ross Geller,How could you have told her?
Ross Geller,"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
Ross Geller,"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
Ross Geller,"That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
Ross Geller,Noo!
Ross Geller,"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
Ross Geller,Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Ross Geller,"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
Ross Geller,Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Ross Geller,"No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth...."
Ross Geller,"Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?"

Ross Geller,"It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?"
Ross Geller,"I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go."
Ross Geller,"No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay."
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes."
Ross Geller,"Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing."
Ross Geller,"Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab."
Ross Geller,"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you."
Ross Geller,"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty."
Ross Geller,"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep."
Ross Geller,"Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Hey, what you do on your own time..."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!"
Ross Geller,"Just, just, just pick one!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay."
Ross Geller,"No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go."
Ross Geller,Thank you!
Ross Geller,"It was, it was her voice."
Ross Geller,Yay!
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick."
Ross Geller,"Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um."
Ross Geller,You're not going to go.
Ross Geller,"How, how, um how can you not be going?"
Ross Geller,"Um, you know, just out of curiosity..."
Ross Geller,"Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled."
Ross Geller,"No, but, your-your mad."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Your not going.
Ross Geller,Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Ross Geller,Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Ross Geller,"No, because your not upset."
Ross Geller,About the yelling.
Ross Geller,"Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay."
Ross Geller,We're good.
Ross Geller,Okay. Honey?
Ross Geller,I love you.
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!"
Ross Geller,"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there."
Ross Geller,"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do."
Ross Geller,"I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers."
Ross Geller,You will?!
Ross Geller,"Well, yeah."
Ross Geller,"How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!"
Ross Geller,"Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!"
Ross Geller,So we're a little late.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Awwww!!!
Ross Geller,Wow! What a pleasure.
Ross Geller,Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Ross Geller,"Aww, is it broken?"
Ross Geller,Mon?
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, look."
Ross Geller,"Look, look, look."
Ross Geller,It's an empty apartment.
Ross Geller,We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Ross Geller,There it is.
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?"
Ross Geller,And it works both ways.
Ross Geller,"Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?"
Ross Geller,"Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her."
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,"Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you."
Ross Geller,Bye sweetie.
Ross Geller,"Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do."
Ross Geller,"Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed..."
Ross Geller,I'm gonna use the cushion.
Ross Geller,"Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you."
Ross Geller,Yep.
Ross Geller,Shoot.
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."
Ross Geller,What are you talking about?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!"
Ross Geller,"Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna....."
Ross Geller,I'm gonna tell Mom.
Ross Geller,Crazy.
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's not the ideal way..."
Ross Geller,How's the maniac?
Ross Geller,You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Ross Geller,Hello.
Ross Geller,"Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
Ross Geller,"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!"
Ross Geller,Are you intrigued?
Ross Geller,"There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?"
Ross Geller,"You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I."
Ross Geller,"Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?"
Ross Geller,"And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?"
Ross Geller,"You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you."
Ross Geller,Where there is no fear of commitment.
Ross Geller,"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi."
Ross Geller,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
Ross Geller,"You'll never get me, Joe!!!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
Ross Geller,"Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What are you talking about?
Ross Geller,"Okay, you are totally making this up."
Ross Geller,Oh God.
Ross Geller,There was no song. There was no song!
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Okay, that's, that's enough."
Ross Geller,Won't you dance around with me.
Ross Geller,'I am Bea. I drink tea. Won't you dance around with....' Ohhh!
Ross Geller,"Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities."
Ross Geller,Spiderman?

Ross Geller,That would be me.
Ross Geller,"Hey, it's my list."
Ross Geller,Okay!! Okay!!
Ross Geller,"Heavy thing, not getting lighter!"
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,Isabella Rosselini.
Ross Geller,Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, maybe."
Ross Geller,What you don't think I'd go up to her?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated."
Ross Geller,"Okay, hold my crawler."
Ross Geller,"Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?"
Ross Geller,"Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery."
Ross Geller,"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity..."
Ross Geller,"Um, yeah."
Ross Geller,"Um, no."
Ross Geller,"But, okay."
Ross Geller,"Um, see, but that's not the final draft."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,We're just gonna be friends.
Ross Geller,I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'll take some."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know while we're on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don't live here anymore."
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, she doesn't know that you sneak out every night, she doesn't know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn't know that you've been living with your Grandmother's for a week now."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Ross Geller,"Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices."
Ross Geller,"I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn't really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it's gonna make a difference"
Ross Geller,"No real-, honey, really it's fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye"
Ross Geller,"I don't know, something girlie."
Ross Geller,Hi. Where is everybody?
Ross Geller,"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
Ross Geller,"'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation."
Ross Geller,"I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!"
Ross Geller,"Well, now I do!!"
Ross Geller,"Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever...."
Ross Geller,"Maybe this would've happened if I'd been more nurturing, or I'd paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can't believe this!"
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Ross Geller,"Wait, wait, wait."
Ross Geller,My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Ross Geller,"No, I can't get it out."
Ross Geller,"No, come on don't start. Ouch!"
Ross Geller,Stupid balls are in the way.
Ross Geller,Oh well. It probably would've been the most constructive solution.
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,My wife's a lesbian.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out....."
Ross Geller,"Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie."
Ross Geller,We?
Ross Geller,"Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry."
Ross Geller,"Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'."
Ross Geller,Fine.
Ross Geller,Hi Gunther.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Come on! That's great.
Ross Geller,Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Ross Geller,Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Ross Geller,"Ugh, museum."
Ross Geller,"There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke."
Ross Geller,It's not a library...
Ross Geller,"So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat."
Ross Geller,It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Ross Geller,"Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that."
Ross Geller,Okay!
Ross Geller,Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Ross Geller,That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Ross Geller,So?
Ross Geller,You really serve people sneezers?
Ross Geller,"Thanks again, Dr. Green."
Ross Geller,"Oh, ah, you don't need that."
Ross Geller,"The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness."
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really."
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Nothing I do means anything, really."
Ross Geller,Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
Ross Geller,Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work."
Ross Geller,"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'"
Ross Geller,"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels."
Ross Geller,Dr. Green. How are you?
Ross Geller,Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Ross Geller,"Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore."
Ross Geller,"Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go."
Ross Geller,"Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that...."
Ross Geller,Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Ross Geller,Uh.
Ross Geller,And his first name.
Ross Geller,Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Ross Geller,Argue with that.
Ross Geller,I know that!
Ross Geller,"What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either."
Ross Geller,"Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?"
Ross Geller,Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Ross Geller,Excellent!
Ross Geller,Neither will I.
Ross Geller,"So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one."
Ross Geller,Why? Why can't you go to him?
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence."
Ross Geller,"Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?"
Ross Geller,"No, no he's not."
Ross Geller,"What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display."
Ross Geller,"Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that."
Ross Geller,"Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you."
Ross Geller,"You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hmm?
Ross Geller,"Joey, Homo Sapiens are people."
Ross Geller,Hey! Everyone.
Ross Geller,How's my little boy?
Ross Geller,"What'd you do, take him whaling?"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben."
Ross Geller,And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
Ross Geller,"Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?"
Ross Geller,"It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
Ross Geller,I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Ross Geller,Monica did it?
Ross Geller,Monica?
Ross Geller,"Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?"
Ross Geller,"Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head."
Ross Geller,"Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know..."
Ross Geller,Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
Ross Geller,"Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!"
Ross Geller,He does not look happy.
Ross Geller,Halftime.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football."
Ross Geller,"It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn't count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking."
Ross Geller,Oh yeah! Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
Ross Geller,"Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, 'nobody won that game, ' and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... threw it in the lake."
Ross Geller,Anyway. That's when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Ross Geller,Can I see you for a second?
Ross Geller,"All right, we're gonna play."
Ross Geller,Here you go.
Ross Geller,"Sweetie, don't worry you'll get picked. Chandler."
Ross Geller,"Sweetie, now I pick you."
Ross Geller,"Okay. All right. So let's see, let's play from the trash can, to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch, we'll kick off."
Ross Geller,Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on!
Ross Geller,"Come on, let's go!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, losers talk!"
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Okay, this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!"
Ross Geller,"You, you go long."
Ross Geller,Until we start to look very small.
Ross Geller,Break!!
Ross Geller,"One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!!"
Ross Geller,"Uh, hello, it's third down."
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Ross Geller,"Okay, it's second down. Take all the second downs you need."
Ross Geller,"Well, I said it loud."
Ross Geller,"Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie.."
Ross Geller,"Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Okay. Hut! Hike!
Ross Geller,"Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count."
Ross Geller,Before the snap!
Ross Geller,"Oh Pheebs, that's great. It doesn't count."
Ross Geller,"Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater."
Ross Geller,"Oh-ho, okay."
Ross Geller,"Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win."
Ross Geller,"Okay, first of all, I don't play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!"
Ross Geller,Oh really! Why is that?
Ross Geller,The Geller Cup.
Ross Geller,"Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!"
Ross Geller,That cup is mine!
Ross Geller,Chandler! Chandler!
Ross Geller,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's with the tackling?
Ross Geller,"Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough."
Ross Geller,"Hey, where'd you get that?"
Ross Geller,"It's no surprise that your winning, 'cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team."
Ross Geller,"What?! The guys against the girls? See, that's ridiculous Monica, because I'm only down by three touchdowns."
Ross Geller,"Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you're with me."
Ross Geller,"Right. Okay, let's play. Let's go."
Ross Geller,"Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys."
Ross Geller,"Okay, y'know what, let's just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill..."
Ross Geller,"Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls."
Ross Geller,Hey! It's 42-21!
Ross Geller,Let go! Let go!
Ross Geller,No! You let go!
Ross Geller,How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Ross Geller,Hey! It's starting to snow.
Ross Geller,Gimme the this!
Ross Geller,"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
Ross Geller,Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Ross Geller,All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Ross Geller,I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?"
Ross Geller,"All right, see you guys."
Ross Geller,"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore."
Ross Geller,"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
Ross Geller,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Ross Geller,"Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?"
Ross Geller,And what is second prize?
Ross Geller,"Well, that makes sense."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, Sarah, anything."
Ross Geller,"Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies."
Ross Geller,"No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird"
Ross Geller,"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs."
Ross Geller,"No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going."
Ross Geller,All right!!
Ross Geller,"...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus."
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?"
Ross Geller,"No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night."
Ross Geller,Mon?
Ross Geller,"Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's."
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em."
Ross Geller,"I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free."
Ross Geller,Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
Ross Geller,"....and 12, 22, 18, four... What?"
Ross Geller,"Ah, we're out. I sold them all."
Ross Geller,"Monica, I'm cutting you off."
Ross Geller,"Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck."
Ross Geller,Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Ross Geller,"Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'The Munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the new dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me 'Cookie Dude!'"
Ross Geller,"Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?"
Ross Geller,Well you sure used a large font.
Ross Geller,"Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay."
Ross Geller,"What, that wasn't the great news?"
Ross Geller,"Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?"
Ross Geller,"Hey now! That was an accident, okay."
Ross Geller,What's a scrud?
Ross Geller,I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Ross Geller,Not nice enough.
Ross Geller,Good for a scrud.
Ross Geller,That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
Ross Geller,Hi there!
Ross Geller,"Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency."
Ross Geller,"Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
Ross Geller,"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out."
Ross Geller,That word was swans.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!"
Ross Geller,Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Ross Geller,Oh no! An asteroid!
Ross Geller,Real magic does exist.
Ross Geller,"Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling."
Ross Geller,"Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then."
Ross Geller,"Oh, somebody's feeling better."
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,"What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?"
Ross Geller,"And he's, he's a total stranger?"
Ross Geller,Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason."
Ross Geller,"Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?"
Ross Geller,"Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?"
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today."
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy."
Ross Geller,That's excellent.
Ross Geller,"So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Ross Geller,Which one is Gina?
Ross Geller,That's okay.
Ross Geller,"Hey, Joey."
Ross Geller,"Ah, which, which one?"
Ross Geller,Mary-Angela.
Ross Geller,Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Ross Geller,"All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
Ross Geller,Where in Cuba?
Ross Geller,Bummer.
Ross Geller,"No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you."
Ross Geller,"But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy."
Ross Geller,"What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?"
Ross Geller,"That's right good things, that-that is what I said."
Ross Geller,That is so made up!
Ross Geller,There you go.
Ross Geller,"Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less."
Ross Geller,High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
Ross Geller,You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Ross Geller,"'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!"
Ross Geller,Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"Well, yeah!"
Ross Geller,You grow up.
Ross Geller,Hi!

Ross Geller,"Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?"
Ross Geller,"What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?"
Ross Geller,"She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?"
Ross Geller,"Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities."

Ross Geller,This is Ross?
Ross Geller,Of Ross and Rachel.
Ross Geller,"Oh hey, hey Mark."
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Hi! What's ah, what's Mark doing answering your phone?"
Ross Geller,"Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?"
Ross Geller,"Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Okay, bye-bye."
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry sweetie, I was just trying to ah, I'm dialing another number."
Ross Geller,"It's from Ross, it's a love bug."

Ross Geller,I mean my God...
Ross Geller,"...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!"
Ross Geller,I would never do that!
Ross Geller,"Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot."

Ross Geller,I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, I was an idiot."
Ross Geller,"A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me."
Ross Geller,"Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away."
Ross Geller,I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon."
Ross Geller,"Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?"
Ross Geller,"Ahh, no."
Ross Geller,Are you jealous?
Ross Geller,You are totally jealous.
Ross Geller,"Honey, I love you too."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Huh.

Ross Geller,Good.
Ross Geller,Joey's asking if you've just ruined the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson?

Ross Geller,"Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm...."
Ross Geller,"Oh, well..."
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean..."
Ross Geller,Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Ross Geller,Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger."
Ross Geller,"What should I wear, now I'm all nervous."
Ross Geller,I'm really glad we came. You're so pretty. I love you.
Ross Geller,So I nodded off a little.
Ross Geller,Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Ross Geller,"First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly."
Ross Geller,"Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
Ross Geller,"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island."
Ross Geller,"No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it."
Ross Geller,That's a little clearer.
Ross Geller,"Sure, I-I-I..."
Ross Geller,Is everything okay?
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"What is ah, Rach in her room?"
Ross Geller,Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Ross Geller,What's that on the bottom?
Ross Geller,"Hey, honey."
Ross Geller,"Hey, what's going on?"
Ross Geller,"What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?"
Ross Geller,Hi!

Ross Geller,"Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but wait..."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
Ross Geller,For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
Ross Geller,"No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!"
Ross Geller,Yes.
Ross Geller,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
Ross Geller,Is this about Mark?
Ross Geller,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
Ross Geller,"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do."

Ross Geller,"Oh, hi Chloe."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead."
Ross Geller,"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
Ross Geller,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?"
Ross Geller,Hi! It's me.
Ross Geller,"Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?"
Ross Geller,Who's that?
Ross Geller,Is that Mark?
Ross Geller,Yeah! Got it!
Ross Geller,"Ah, that's okay, thanks."
Ross Geller,"Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?"
Ross Geller,I like this song.
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, no."
Ross Geller,"I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore."
Ross Geller,Is this about Mark?
Ross Geller,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
Ross Geller,"Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something.."

Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well...."
Ross Geller,"Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time."
Ross Geller,"Yes, you can, very much."
Ross Geller,Ahhhh!!
Ross Geller,"You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did."
Ross Geller,"What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but don't you think...."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, okay."
Ross Geller,What trail?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail."
Ross Geller,Chloe? Hi..
Ross Geller,You took my watch?
Ross Geller,"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?"
Ross Geller,"Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?"
Ross Geller,"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met..."
Ross Geller,"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?"
Ross Geller,"Actually, no, we're not."
Ross Geller,"No, we're not."
Ross Geller,"No, we're not!!"
Ross Geller,Right.
Ross Geller,Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Ross Geller,Jasmine?
Ross Geller,"We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller."
Ross Geller,"Yes, I did."
Ross Geller,Very bad.
Ross Geller,"I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?"
Ross Geller,"Thank you, thank you."
Ross Geller,Who's your roommate?
Ross Geller,"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
Ross Geller,"Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!"
Ross Geller,Rachel?
Ross Geller,"No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?"
Ross Geller,No!!
Ross Geller,No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,She was...
Ross Geller,"She, she was different."
Ross Geller,Nobody likes change.
Ross Geller,"What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible."
Ross Geller,"Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!"
Ross Geller,"Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up."
Ross Geller,"That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up."
Ross Geller,"Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!"
Ross Geller,"Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!"
Ross Geller,"Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to."
Ross Geller,Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Ross Geller,Yes I would.
Ross Geller,Yes.
Ross Geller,"La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you."
Ross Geller,"What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?"
Ross Geller,"Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'"
Ross Geller,"Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself."
Ross Geller,No anchovies.
Ross Geller,"That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off."
Ross Geller,"You can have the last piece, if you want."
Ross Geller,"What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!"
Ross Geller,"Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!"
Ross Geller,That's what?!
Ross Geller,"Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, okay."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together..."
Ross Geller,"Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and...."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean."
Ross Geller,"Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks."
Ross Geller,"Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, this weekend guys!"
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,"So, for the whole weekend?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand."
Ross Geller,What a pity stay?
Ross Geller,"Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?"
Ross Geller,Where's Ben?
Ross Geller,"Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
Ross Geller,"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
Ross Geller,Ah! Oh.
Ross Geller,"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well."
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, I'd love that."
Ross Geller,I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Ross Geller,"....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."
Ross Geller,"717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?"
Ross Geller,"Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, now you want a favour?"
Ross Geller,"Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
Ross Geller,"No, I'm not gonna pick them up."
Ross Geller,"No, Rachel doesn't want me to...."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you're right."
Ross Geller,"We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you."
Ross Geller,"Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk."
Ross Geller,"He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I'm stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I've got plenty of people to help on the Interstate."
Ross Geller,Excuse me?
Ross Geller,"Oh please, can't I come to your special, magical cabin?"
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills."
Ross Geller,"All right Pheebs, your cab's ready."
Ross Geller,You're welcome.
Ross Geller,We were on a break!
Ross Geller,"Hey-hey, it's valid okay? And I'm not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me."
Ross Geller,That's what you said last night.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Obviously not to Joey.
Ross Geller,"Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no."
Ross Geller,I can.
Ross Geller,"Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go."
Ross Geller,"No, no, really, I've got to take the car back anyway, I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It's fine, no guilt I promise."
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,That would be great.
Ross Geller,I know!
Ross Geller,Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Ross Geller,"Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?"
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?"
Ross Geller,So I'm gonna take off then!
Ross Geller,Pffhah.
Ross Geller,"Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap."
Ross Geller,"Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay."
Ross Geller,Here you go.
Ross Geller,Sorry.
Ross Geller,"Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party."
Ross Geller,And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?"
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself."
Ross Geller,All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that."
Ross Geller,"No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel."
Ross Geller,"No, I ah, I slept with someone else."
Ross Geller,It didn't.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah."
Ross Geller,"Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, no! No!"

Ross Geller,"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
Ross Geller,You get the dollhouse.

Ross Geller,"Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want."
Ross Geller,All I have to do is close my eyes. See? Woo-hoo!!
Ross Geller,"Ah, I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,"Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It's one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. Oop, oh yeah!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry, it will never happen... Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I'm the king."

Ross Geller,"But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream."
Ross Geller,"Uh, oh-ho bye."
Ross Geller,One.
Ross Geller,"Look. Look, I wasn't going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore."
Ross Geller,No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Ross Geller,"No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats."
Ross Geller,"Okay, fine, fine. You don't want to believe me? No, that's fine."

Ross Geller,"Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you."
Ross Geller,"No, but it's-it's-it's hot!"
Ross Geller,I can't believe no one believes me!
Ross Geller,You do Pheebs?
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
Ross Geller,"No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body."
Ross Geller,"Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out."
Ross Geller,"Come on you guys, it's no big deal!"
Ross Geller,Well what is it? Is it a mole?
Ross Geller,"Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?"
Ross Geller,Ahhh.
Ross Geller,Hey guys!
Ross Geller,"Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign."
Ross Geller,"He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it."
Ross Geller,"At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that'd be cool!"
Ross Geller,"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
Ross Geller,Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Ross Geller,No?
Ross Geller,"Well then, what is it?!"
Ross Geller,Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Ross Geller,"Yes, and the dimmer switch."
Ross Geller,"Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!"
Ross Geller,Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Ross Geller,"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory."
Ross Geller,Gimme this.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so..."
Ross Geller,What's a koondis?
Ross Geller,I guess it's worth a try.
Ross Geller,What?! What?!
Ross Geller,We?! We angered it?!
Ross Geller,Oh God!
Ross Geller,Ow!!
Ross Geller,"What was, what was that?"
Ross Geller,What?! How's that?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What happened?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
Ross Geller,"Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
Ross Geller,"That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations."
Ross Geller,"Dude, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,"All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!"
Ross Geller,"Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble."
Ross Geller,All right! You go get him! Let's go!
Ross Geller,Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Ross Geller,Hot dog?
Ross Geller,"What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific."
Ross Geller,"No, I-I'm saying I liked her."
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again."
Ross Geller,"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry."
Ross Geller,"Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"
Ross Geller,"Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't."
Ross Geller,That's too bad.
Ross Geller,"Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I think she looks good."
Ross Geller,"Go, go, go!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat."
Ross Geller,No-o-o! No way!
Ross Geller,"Yeah well, if ah, if that's the rule this weekend... No!"
Ross Geller,Get away!
Ross Geller,Stay away!
Ross Geller,No! No!
Ross Geller,"Ow! Ow! Oh, no-no-no!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Okay, Fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points. Yeah."
Ross Geller,"Okay, come on! Daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the Prehistoric Forensics Department! Okay. Take Pinky Tuscadero up to Inspiration Point, collect three cool points!! Yeah! Which gives me five, and let's see who is gonna lose their clothes. Ummmm, I think I pick our strip poker sponsor Mr. Joey Tribianni."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?"
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Hey! Hi Bonnie!
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,Good morning.
Ross Geller,Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Ross Geller,"Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering."
Ross Geller,Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
Ross Geller,"Nooo, but it, but it's great."
Ross Geller,Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that's right, that's right, it was you!"
Ross Geller,She said you gave her the razor!
Ross Geller,"Ahh, no, I'm good."
Ross Geller,"Okay, have fun! Wooo!!"
Ross Geller,You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!
Ross Geller,"You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!"
Ross Geller,"Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?"
Ross Geller,You still love me?
Ross Geller,You still love me.
Ross Geller,"Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing."
Ross Geller,"I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!"
Ross Geller,Good night.
Ross Geller,Okey-dokey!
Ross Geller,"Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,Awww.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Okay, I gotta go."
Ross Geller,"Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie."
Ross Geller,"Well, yeah. I can't-I can't stay here all night, and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna... do stuff."
Ross Geller,"No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her..."
Ross Geller,"Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah. It wasn't every morning."
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,It's over.
Ross Geller,"Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left."
Ross Geller,Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Ross Geller,"Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'll be up in, 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting."
Ross Geller,Oh. Oh-oh.
Ross Geller,Done!
Ross Geller,"Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!"
Ross Geller,I'm sorry.
Ross Geller,"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance."
Ross Geller,"No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does."
Ross Geller,"Oh, sure! I'm sure."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What happened?
Ross Geller,It does. It really and truly does.
Ross Geller,It so does not!!!
Ross Geller,"She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!"
Ross Geller,"Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, ""If you accept full responsibility..."" Full responsibility! ""...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"""
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this."
Ross Geller,What the hell happened on that beach?!
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?"
Ross Geller,What happened? Joey?
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!"
Ross Geller,I missed you too.
Ross Geller,I suppose.
Ross Geller,Umm-hmm.
Ross Geller,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Ross Geller,"And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!"
Ross Geller,I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Ross Geller,I fell asleep!
Ross Geller,"It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'"
Ross Geller,FINE BY ME!!
Ross Geller,"Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!"
Ross Geller,Who's Chip?
Ross Geller,The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Ross Geller,"Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!"
Ross Geller,I was just leaving.
Ross Geller,Why? Did you write it?
Ross Geller,"Well ah, actually..."
Ross Geller,"Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sure."
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?"
Ross Geller,I'm reading your ad.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Good, so do I"
Ross Geller,"Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?"
Ross Geller,So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Ross Geller,"So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
Ross Geller,"So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?"
Ross Geller,"Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!"
Ross Geller,No you don't.
Ross Geller,"No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this."
Ross Geller,"I do not always have to be-okay, okay."
Ross Geller,Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Ross Geller,"Yes, we have to tell her!"
Ross Geller,"Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,"Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?"
Ross Geller,"You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?"
Ross Geller,"Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place."
Ross Geller,"No! No! Look-Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!"
Ross Geller,None.
Ross Geller,I'm sorry.
Ross Geller,I don't know what to say.
Ross Geller,"Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother."
Ross Geller,"Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon."
Ross Geller,"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do."
Ross Geller,...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Ross Geller,The volcano?
Ross Geller,With such a sad history.
Ross Geller,So why don't you quit?
Ross Geller,Who is Maria?
Ross Geller,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Ross Geller,So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Ross Geller,They make you take an oath?
Ross Geller,Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Ross Geller,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong."
Ross Geller,"One more time, ""Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"""
Ross Geller,Good! That's good!
Ross Geller,Me? No.
Ross Geller,"It's okay man, be strong."
Ross Geller,"No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech."
Ross Geller,"And that's funny, why?"
Ross Geller,"Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source."
Ross Geller,And that's not against your oath?!
Ross Geller,Hello.
Ross Geller,We'd like to close our accounts.
Ross Geller,No-no.
Ross Geller,"No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account."
Ross Geller,"Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it."
Ross Geller,"Oh, mine's December..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda."
Ross Geller,Good luck!
Ross Geller,"Come on, Pheebs lay off him."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,"Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little ""playing"" ourselves."
Ross Geller,"Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something."
Ross Geller,Oh!
Ross Geller,Monica knows.
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head."
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,Wow! You-you look great!
Ross Geller,Okay! Hey Tommy.
Ross Geller,"Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,I-I-I...
Ross Geller,Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Ross Geller,Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,Are you serious?
Ross Geller,"Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
Ross Geller,At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Ross Geller,You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Ross Geller,Fine.
Ross Geller,Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Ross Geller,You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Ross Geller,I know!
Ross Geller,"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era."
Ross Geller,"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow."
Ross Geller,Fine by me; hope she wins.
Ross Geller,How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Ross Geller,"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?"
Ross Geller,Huh...
Ross Geller,Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Ross Geller,Mitzi is.....
Ross Geller,"Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?"
Ross Geller,"Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, why not?"
Ross Geller,You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Ross Geller,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here."
Ross Geller,What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Ross Geller,"No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell."
Ross Geller,I don't know. Soap?
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, okay you're right."
Ross Geller,"I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?"
Ross Geller,"It's, uh... it's endearing, really."
Ross Geller,Yes. Yes I do.
Ross Geller,Department of Sanitation?
Ross Geller,Oh! Ah. Aw!
Ross Geller,"Ah, Cheryl!"
Ross Geller,"Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out."
Ross Geller,"Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise."
Ross Geller,"Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease... BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it."
Ross Geller,"Well umm, y'know, I used to play."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long, and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?"
Ross Geller,"No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in-No, yeah, okay."
Ross Geller,"Okay, guys."
Ross Geller,"Here we go. Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before, so it's important that-that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions. Y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That's what I'm..."
Ross Geller,"Really?! I mean, really?!!"
Ross Geller,"Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so..."
Ross Geller,Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Ross Geller,Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"
Ross Geller,Pheebs...
Ross Geller,"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, okay."
Ross Geller,Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside."
Ross Geller,"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
Ross Geller,"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
Ross Geller,"Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, like I could lose it."
Ross Geller,I played bad on purpose guys.
Ross Geller,"Yeah-no, just that last song."
Ross Geller,Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Ross Geller,Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
Ross Geller,"Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!"
Ross Geller,"So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch."
Ross Geller,"Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me."
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back."
Ross Geller,"Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year."
Ross Geller,"Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh..."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What are you doing?
Ross Geller,Everything? Even the TV?
Ross Geller,"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?"
Ross Geller,"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
Ross Geller,You've sentenced him?!
Ross Geller,"Joey, the guy's your best friend."
Ross Geller,"Oh, who? Me?"
Ross Geller,Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Ross Geller,I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Ross Geller,He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather."
Ross Geller,"Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?"
Ross Geller,I just wanna check something.
Ross Geller,"Now, we'll see."
Ross Geller,"The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver."
Ross Geller,Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Ross Geller,What did you get?
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?"
Ross Geller,"Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them."
Ross Geller,"There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings."
Ross Geller,"I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that."
Ross Geller,He's taking her purse!
Ross Geller,What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch."
Ross Geller,Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Ross Geller,"Dude, we are sooo gonna party!"
Ross Geller,"Mike ""Gandolf"" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world."
Ross Geller,I'm gonna call after you!
Ross Geller,"Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!"
Ross Geller,Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Ross Geller,"Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!"
Ross Geller,Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Ross Geller,What happened?
Ross Geller,"Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
Ross Geller,"It's Gandolf, and he's not coming."
Ross Geller,No! I balanced my checkbook.
Ross Geller,I can't believe he didn't come!
Ross Geller,"Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!"
Ross Geller,There's other stuff too.
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Yeah!!
Ross Geller,It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Ross Geller,"Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,I'm kinda beat.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, me too."
Ross Geller,"I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place."
Ross Geller,How sad are we?
Ross Geller,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?"
Ross Geller,15? Your personal best!
Ross Geller,"Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate."
Ross Geller,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy."
Ross Geller,"No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
Ross Geller,"Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight."
Ross Geller,You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Ross Geller,"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun."
Ross Geller,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,I wasn't sleeping.
Ross Geller,"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date."
Ross Geller,"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn."
Ross Geller,"Y'know, you're right. Thank you."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Are we really in Montreal?!
Ross Geller,"Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Uh actually Joey, it's the Cretasous period."
Ross Geller,My God!
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!"
Ross Geller,"Well, the stuff I just mentioned."
Ross Geller,That is really nice...lying! No way is that the reason!
Ross Geller,And you're afraid you won't be able to...fill his shoes.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor."
Ross Geller,Just go for it Chandler.
Ross Geller,"That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey."
Ross Geller,"Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
Ross Geller,"But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together."
Ross Geller,"It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?"
Ross Geller,"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me."
Ross Geller,"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!"
Ross Geller,"All right, there you go!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, good-good for you."
Ross Geller,"Wow, Rhonda."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, okay, Scott!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?"
Ross Geller,"Now, how will they know if you're ready?"

Ross Geller,They have another guess.
Ross Geller,How did you know she would buy scotch tape?
Ross Geller,"Oh sure, ""Ross will do it!"" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own."
Ross Geller,"No-no-no, I-I wanna play."
Ross Geller,The test is ready.

Ross Geller,"Oh no-no-no, I'm there."
Ross Geller,Oh yeah!
Ross Geller,Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Ross Geller,"All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them."
Ross Geller,"Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you."

Ross Geller,"Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, whatever."
Ross Geller,So you were right?
Ross Geller,Chandler!
Ross Geller,"He's right, what she did was unforgivable."
Ross Geller,How might you be wrong?
Ross Geller,That's all you're basing this on?
Ross Geller,"So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?"
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,This is beautiful!
Ross Geller,"Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What are you saying?
Ross Geller,"Well, if-if she thought they were on a break..."

Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Hi!

Ross Geller,"All right, I'll do it."
Ross Geller,Please hurry.
Ross Geller,"When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn't be miserable? I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person."
Ross Geller,"I've gotta go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Emily is...incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. Oh! And you! Rach!"
Ross Geller,Hey! You were so right!
Ross Geller,"Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other."
Ross Geller,"I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy..."
Ross Geller,"Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know."
Ross Geller,But now! I'm there! I'm totally there! I'm-I'm finally where you are!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily."
Ross Geller,Happy for you.
Ross Geller,"No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe."
Ross Geller,Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Ross Geller,"Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?"
Ross Geller,"What's ah, what's so funny about that?"
Ross Geller,"Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so..."
Ross Geller,Cheers!
Ross Geller,"Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey, I can handle it! All right?"
Ross Geller,That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
Ross Geller,"And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?"
Ross Geller,"Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby."
Ross Geller,"Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!"
Ross Geller,"Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle."
Ross Geller,They don't look any bigger than me!
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,"Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!"
Ross Geller,Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Ross Geller,You'll see.
Ross Geller,JOEY!!!!!!
Ross Geller,"Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?"
Ross Geller,Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
Ross Geller,"Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!"
Ross Geller,That's not true!
Ross Geller,"What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!"
Ross Geller,I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Ross Geller,"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything."
Ross Geller,I like that.
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,"All right, bad ankle, got it!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!"
Ross Geller,"But-but, Liam's on my team."
Ross Geller,"I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!"
Ross Geller,"Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket."
Ross Geller,"No, not you."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?"
Ross Geller,"I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks."
Ross Geller,"Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you."
Ross Geller,"No, no, I'm serious. Thank you."
Ross Geller,"It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not."
Ross Geller,"Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Bye.
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know."
Ross Geller,Pheebs!
Ross Geller,Hello! Hello!
Ross Geller,"Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party."
Ross Geller,You really didn't know?
Ross Geller,So we should probably get going soon.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner."
Ross Geller,"No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, ""Surprise!"" And then, ""Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"""
Ross Geller,Monica said that did she?
Ross Geller,"Yes, we have something we have to get to."
Ross Geller,What big thing?
Ross Geller,"Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play."
Ross Geller,"Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away."
Ross Geller,"That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so..."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Helps a little.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, have a seat."
Ross Geller,"That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?"
Ross Geller,What do you mean?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment."
Ross Geller,You think?
Ross Geller,"Hey, you're right."
Ross Geller,Thanks. What photo album was it?
Ross Geller,"Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!"
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"So uh, Emily just went to the airport."
Ross Geller,"Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so..."
Ross Geller,Nah.
Ross Geller,"Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, ""This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."""
Ross Geller,And why do you care so much?
Ross Geller,You had fantasies about Emily?
Ross Geller,Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Ross Geller,Ahh.
Ross Geller,"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?"
Ross Geller,What-what is love really?
Ross Geller,I am a good kisser.
Ross Geller,Emily!
Ross Geller,"I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off."
Ross Geller,"That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you."
Ross Geller,"Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you."
Ross Geller,That's no problem.
Ross Geller,I did.
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,"She said, ""Thank you."" I said, ""I love you."" And she said, ""Thank you."""
Ross Geller,What do I do now?
Ross Geller,She already lives in London.
Ross Geller,"Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over."
Ross Geller,Hello?
Ross Geller,"Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?"
Ross Geller,"No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called."
Ross Geller,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Ross Geller,"She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy."
Ross Geller,Well...
Ross Geller,"I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!"
Ross Geller,"No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,I made fun of his accent.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,"All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!"
Ross Geller,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!"
Ross Geller,About four hours.
Ross Geller,"I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Ohh! Thank you.
Ross Geller,"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
Ross Geller,"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
Ross Geller,"Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand."
Ross Geller,"I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan."
Ross Geller,"Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so..."
Ross Geller,Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"So uh, Emily called last night..."
Ross Geller,"Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they're going to the theatre together! They're going to dinner! They're going horseback riding!"
Ross Geller,"Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for Like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was ""My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."""
Ross Geller,"Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?"
Ross Geller,How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Ross Geller,What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
Ross Geller,Oh. What's wrong with Ross?
Ross Geller,"Actually that-that's not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found... Y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."" I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, ""No."" So, he's sweeping."
Ross Geller,"So umm, any word from Susan?"
Ross Geller,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?"
Ross Geller,"Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married."
Ross Geller,Am I?!
Ross Geller,Am I?!
Ross Geller,"Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?"
Ross Geller,OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Ross Geller,"So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!"
Ross Geller,So! Poetry? Susan's gay! They're being gay together!
Ross Geller,"Oh, wake up!"
Ross Geller,Excuse me?
Ross Geller,"Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,It does not!
Ross Geller,This is not fun!
Ross Geller,"Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing."
Ross Geller,Nice luggage.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh, I missed you too."
Ross Geller,No tongue.
Ross Geller,"Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?"
Ross Geller,"Uh, I don't know, whatever."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!"
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day."
Ross Geller,"One more day, seriously/"
Ross Geller,"So, then you can stay as long as you want."
Ross Geller,"Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on."
Ross Geller,"No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy."
Ross Geller,"Hey, guys!"
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it."
Ross Geller,"I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?"
Ross Geller,"Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle."
Ross Geller,Yeah!! Yeah!
Ross Geller,"I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, ""Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."""
Ross Geller,"Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!"
Ross Geller,I could ask her to live with me!
Ross Geller,"I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!"
Ross Geller,"Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?"
Ross Geller,I don't want to do that.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Move in with me.
Ross Geller,"Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be."
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!"
Ross Geller,"No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"No, no, don't. Why don't we?"
Ross Geller,Get married.
Ross Geller,"No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?"
Ross Geller,Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?

Ross Geller,"Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys..."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hey guys!
Ross Geller,"Oh no, not yet."
Ross Geller,"Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah-oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but it didn't fit. Well, luckily there's a store here that has one left in her size, but I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress..."
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,What's wah-pah?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?"
Ross Geller,"So listen uh, I know you and I haven't really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were."
Ross Geller,"I know if you were getting married I'd feel, kinda..... y'know."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"All right, I just wanted to check."
Ross Geller,You're great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, I didn't mean, uh..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn't realise that had become anything, yet."
Ross Geller,Oh. Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Wow, that's-that's-that's incredible."
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,I gotta get to work.
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know, y'know what would make me really happy?"
Ross Geller,"If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend, why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, all right, it's a date."
Ross Geller,Did you say something?
Ross Geller,Hey man.
Ross Geller,"So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?"
Ross Geller,Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Ross Geller,Yep!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three."
Ross Geller,What happened?
Ross Geller,Noo. Why?
Ross Geller,"Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,Come here.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,You okay?
Ross Geller,"Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?"
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Sure. Why not?
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?"
Ross Geller,Yeah sure.
Ross Geller,"Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want."
Ross Geller,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
Ross Geller,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Ross Geller,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
Ross Geller,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
Ross Geller,"See, I see.... big passion in your future."
Ross Geller,I do.
Ross Geller,"Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
Ross Geller,"Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
Ross Geller,What? Ow!
Ross Geller,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
Ross Geller,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine."
Ross Geller,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Ross Geller,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Ross Geller,"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
Ross Geller,Fine.
Ross Geller,Good.
Ross Geller,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
Ross Geller,Is this about Mark?
Ross Geller,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
Ross Geller,"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!"
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!"

Ross Geller,"She, she was different."
Ross Geller,Nobody likes change.
Ross Geller,"What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
Ross Geller,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment."
Ross Geller,You think?
Ross Geller,"Hey, you're right."
Ross Geller,"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig."
Ross Geller,"Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either."
Ross Geller,"Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-"

Ross Geller,"OK, I need to lie down."
Ross Geller,"Really. It's always been you, Rach."
Ross Geller,"I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
Ross Geller,"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
Ross Geller,"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place."
Ross Geller,"Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?"
Ross Geller,You still love me?
Ross Geller,"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,FINE BY ME!!
Ross Geller,"You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this."
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off."
Ross Geller,"OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright."
Ross Geller,Okay dad.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well."
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?"
Ross Geller,Hey guys!
Ross Geller,"All right, here's the ring."
Ross Geller,"So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
Ross Geller,I sort've already asked Chandler.
Ross Geller,"Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer."
Ross Geller,"Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!"
Ross Geller,"Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man."
Ross Geller,Great. Great.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut."
Ross Geller,"Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, see ya later."
Ross Geller,"Hey listen man, about the stripper..."
Ross Geller,Good call!
Ross Geller,"Hey-hey, what are those?"
Ross Geller,Wow! Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey."
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks!"
Ross Geller,Hey guys!
Ross Geller,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, right!"
Ross Geller,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
Ross Geller,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
Ross Geller,My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Ross Geller,"All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!"
Ross Geller,Not on you! On the stripper!
Ross Geller,"Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!"
Ross Geller,"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!"
Ross Geller,Diverse.
Ross Geller,Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Ross Geller,We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Ross Geller,Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Ross Geller,Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Ross Geller,"No, that's all right."
Ross Geller,"Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys."
Ross Geller,"Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good..."
Ross Geller,Total wuss!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Hey! Are you ready yet?
Ross Geller,"Oh! Got 'em right here, check!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, cheerie-o!"
Ross Geller,"Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,"So, we're off."
Ross Geller,"Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!"
Ross Geller,So-so come! Why don't you come?
Ross Geller,To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
Ross Geller,Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
Ross Geller,This is my wedding.
Ross Geller,Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Ross Geller,"All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!"
Ross Geller,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,No! No! That's-that's time-out!
Ross Geller,"Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on."
Ross Geller,Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here."
Ross Geller,It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Ross Geller,"Uh-huh, I see that."
Ross Geller,What? What?
Ross Geller,"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding."
Ross Geller,Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Ross Geller,She said what?
Ross Geller,"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right."
Ross Geller,I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Ross Geller,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Ross Geller,No. I'm saying it's now.
Ross Geller,There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Ross Geller,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-"
Ross Geller,Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Ross Geller,Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Ross Geller,"Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out."
Ross Geller,Excuse me?
Ross Geller,I don't know. A month?
Ross Geller,"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun."
Ross Geller,Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Ross Geller,Come on.
Ross Geller,"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles..."
Ross Geller,"But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want."
Ross Geller,"And, I don't know, if it starts to rain..."
Ross Geller,Hi. Mom. Dad.
Ross Geller,"what's up, Dad?"
Ross Geller,"Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?"
Ross Geller,"Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn."
Ross Geller,"I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face."
Ross Geller,"Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding."
Ross Geller,I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Ross Geller,"I'm getting married, to..day!!"
Ross Geller,"Ahh, whoo-hoo!!"
Ross Geller,I do. I do. I do.
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,Dad!!
Ross Geller,"Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control."
Ross Geller,"Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! That's right!!"
Ross Geller,It was...This disagreement over... My god. You...you look beautiful.
Ross Geller,"You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have."
Ross Geller,My God. Rachel! Your here. I can't believe it. What happen? Why are you here?
Ross Geller,I Ross...
Ross Geller,"Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily."
Ross Geller,"I, Ross..."
Ross Geller,"Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else."
Ross Geller,"As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily."
Ross Geller,Happy to.
Ross Geller,Yay!
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?"
Ross Geller,"That-that-that's all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I'll be right out here. She's just fixing her makeup."
Ross Geller,"And, I love you!!"
Ross Geller,"That's true, thanks dad. People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!!"
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?"
Ross Geller,"No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you..."
Ross Geller,But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
Ross Geller,"Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!"
Ross Geller,"Look, I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,"Oh, right!"
Ross Geller,Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
Ross Geller,Emily?!
Ross Geller,"No, I've looked everywhere!"
Ross Geller,"No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here."
Ross Geller,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
Ross Geller,That's cool.
Ross Geller,"Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt."
Ross Geller,Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Ross Geller,"Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?"
Ross Geller,"Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that."
Ross Geller,Rach! Rach!
Ross Geller,"Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?"
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,Not yet.
Ross Geller,Pretty soon I guess.
Ross Geller,"I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?"
Ross Geller,Same difference.
Ross Geller,"I get it! Well, that's that."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know..."
Ross Geller,"I could, yeah, I can do that."
Ross Geller,"I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!"
Ross Geller,"I know, why not?"
Ross Geller,Right?
Ross Geller,Y'know-thanks!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well...nah."
Ross Geller,"Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?"
Ross Geller,"No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend."
Ross Geller,Okay!
Ross Geller,Cool!
Ross Geller,Come on! Here.
Ross Geller,Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Ross Geller,You tell them to wait!
Ross Geller,Emily.
Ross Geller,Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Ross Geller,I Ross...
Ross Geller,"Take thee, Rachel... Emily. Emily."
Ross Geller,"I, Ross..."
Ross Geller,"Take thee, Emily. Like there'd be anybody else."
Ross Geller,"As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily."
Ross Geller,Happy too.
Ross Geller,Yay!
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn't it?"

Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?"
Ross Geller,"No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend."
Ross Geller,Okay!
Ross Geller,Cool!
Ross Geller,Come on! Here.

Ross Geller,You tell them to wait!
Ross Geller,Emily.
Ross Geller,Oh no-no-no! Oh-no! No! No! Emily!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Ohh...
Ross Geller,"Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center."
Ross Geller,Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Ross Geller,"Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?"
Ross Geller,"No, not since I lost her at the airport."
Ross Geller,"HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!"
Ross Geller,"Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry."
Ross Geller,"That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible."
Ross Geller,"So, what? That's it?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best."
Ross Geller,"Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,She's doing her laundry.
Ross Geller,"It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while."
Ross Geller,I can't catch a break!
Ross Geller,What thing?
Ross Geller,"Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre."
Ross Geller,"Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!"
Ross Geller,Wait! It was my plan.
Ross Geller,"And, I came up with Atlantic City."
Ross Geller,The paper.
Ross Geller,Events from around the globe.
Ross Geller,"Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized..."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Go ahead.
Ross Geller,Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Ross Geller,What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Ross Geller,Why are you laughing?
Ross Geller,"Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding."
Ross Geller,"Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. ""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"" Don't know!"
Ross Geller,"Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is..."
Ross Geller,That is what the thing is.
Ross Geller,"No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you."
Ross Geller,No thank you for... Thank you.
Ross Geller,"Okay, let's go!"
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now."
Ross Geller,It's all right.
Ross Geller,"Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!"
Ross Geller,Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Ross Geller,"Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, he's head of the department."
Ross Geller,Hello.
Ross Geller,"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?"
Ross Geller,"To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie..."
Ross Geller,"Again, it's not that he..."
Ross Geller,"Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang."
Ross Geller,Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Ross Geller,Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
Ross Geller,I do too! I do too!
Ross Geller,Argh!
Ross Geller,Argh!
Ross Geller,"You did it, man."
Ross Geller,I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Ross Geller,"I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!"
Ross Geller,Hello.
Ross Geller,"Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!"
Ross Geller,"No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!"
Ross Geller,Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Ross Geller,She's talking.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship."
Ross Geller,In London!
Ross Geller,She wants me to move to London.
Ross Geller,I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Ross Geller,It could happen.
Ross Geller,"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?"
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out."
Ross Geller,"All right, did you just say all right?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!"
Ross Geller,"Yes, tell me."
Ross Geller,"I know. I am, I am so sorry."
Ross Geller,"Again, very sorry."
Ross Geller,"Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you."
Ross Geller,Oh that is so great! That's...
Ross Geller,"So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes."
Ross Geller,No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Ross Geller,"I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!"
Ross Geller,"Thanks for the help, problem solved."
Ross Geller,"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate."
Ross Geller,"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!"
Ross Geller,For what?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily."
Ross Geller,"It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff."
Ross Geller,Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Ross Geller,"No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help."
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,"Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?"
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Ross Geller,Damn!
Ross Geller,"I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it."
Ross Geller,"Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the ""I get to see my wife,"" part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this."
Ross Geller,I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Ross Geller,"So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?"
Ross Geller,"Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily..."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,Le Poo's still alive?!
Ross Geller,"Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?"
Ross Geller,"Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!"
Ross Geller,You're nose is bleeding!
Ross Geller,Umm...
Ross Geller,"Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore."
Ross Geller,"Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out."
Ross Geller,"Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?"
Ross Geller,"And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants..."
Ross Geller,...is for me not to see you anymore.
Ross Geller,"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here."
Ross Geller,You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Ross Geller,What are you doing?
Ross Geller,"Rachel, this is your apartment."
Ross Geller,You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Ross Geller,Yes! Please!
Ross Geller,That's okay.
Ross Geller,That's not advice!
Ross Geller,I'm going to the bathroom.
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?"
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back."
Ross Geller,"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?"
Ross Geller,"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?"
Ross Geller,I can't believe this is happening.
Ross Geller,I am so sorry.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,How come? Everybody else does.
Ross Geller,"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things."
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new."
Ross Geller,Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Ross Geller,"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine."
Ross Geller,After what I did? Can you blame her?
Ross Geller,"No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye."
Ross Geller,"Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!"
Ross Geller,"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other."
Ross Geller,"Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!"
Ross Geller,I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Ross Geller,"No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples."
Ross Geller,"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there."
Ross Geller,"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move."
Ross Geller,"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice..."
Ross Geller,Why?
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!"
Ross Geller,Yep.
Ross Geller,Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Ross Geller,"Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now."
Ross Geller,Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Ross Geller,"You do, huh?"
Ross Geller,What are you talking about?
Ross Geller,Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Ross Geller,"Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!"
Ross Geller,"Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on."
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, she's here."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?"
Ross Geller,"Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with."
Ross Geller,"Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me."
Ross Geller,"So, can you trust me?"
Ross Geller,"Well, I guess that's it."
Ross Geller,My marriage is over.
Ross Geller,Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Ross Geller,Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Ross Geller,"Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back."
Ross Geller,Who needs a lease when it's family!
Ross Geller,You got it.
Ross Geller,"Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Hey roomies!
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!"
Ross Geller,"Pretty cool, huh?"
Ross Geller,"Joey, please!"
Ross Geller,"Uh fellas,"
Ross Geller,I'll take sports.
Ross Geller,"All right. Uhh, international."
Ross Geller,"Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here."
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio."
Ross Geller,"Okay, let's go."
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it."
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,"I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking."
Ross Geller,"So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?"
Ross Geller,How about you?
Ross Geller,"All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application."
Ross Geller,"Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So..."
Ross Geller,"Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space."
Ross Geller,Are you guys sure about this?
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,"So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just ."
Ross Geller,"Come on, it's fun!"
Ross Geller,I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Ross Geller,"Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm."
Ross Geller,I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Ross Geller,"Oh God, no."
Ross Geller,You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Ross Geller,"In this life, Phoebe."
Ross Geller,Yeah that's the same.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, this is Monica."
Ross Geller,"Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food."
Ross Geller,"So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college."
Ross Geller,"Well, that's cool. So did..."
Ross Geller,"Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for."
Ross Geller,Monica!
Ross Geller,So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night."
Ross Geller,"All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Ross Geller,Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
Ross Geller,"So uh, where's Monica?"
Ross Geller,Dude!
Ross Geller,"Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!"
Ross Geller,"Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!"
Ross Geller,"Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that."
Ross Geller,"Well, they're not mine!"
Ross Geller,Why are they here?
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Ross Geller,My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Ross Geller,"Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!"
Ross Geller,"That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything."
Ross Geller,"Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, ""Keep your mitts off my grub?"""
Ross Geller,Phoebe!
Ross Geller,"Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that."
Ross Geller,"That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, of course, Donald."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here..."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,You ate my sandwich?
Ross Geller,Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Ross Geller,Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Ross Geller,That said it was my sandwich?!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Ross Geller,MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross Geller,MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Ross Geller,Hey Chandler. Monica!
Ross Geller,I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Ross Geller,On account of my rage.
Ross Geller,He gave me a pill for it.
Ross Geller,"Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it."
Ross Geller,"I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich."
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,Dude! That's my sister!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, what's going on?"
Ross Geller,You slept with my sister?
Ross Geller,This is not good for my rage.
Ross Geller,My God Monica!!
Ross Geller,Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Ross Geller,"I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products."
Ross Geller,"Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!"
Ross Geller,"So what, we just sit?"
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?"
Ross Geller,Or that.
Ross Geller,"I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character."
Ross Geller,And it can't be Joey.
Ross Geller,Or Joseph.
Ross Geller,"All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball."
Ross Geller,This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Ross Geller,"And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!"
Ross Geller,No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
Ross Geller,"So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?"
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, yeah."
Ross Geller,"Uh, you weighted 200 pounds."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, not since I got too strong for you."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Oh fine.
Ross Geller,Joey's not going.
Ross Geller,Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Ross Geller,"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball."
Ross Geller,I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Ross Geller,"And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing."
Ross Geller,If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Ross Geller,"How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!"
Ross Geller,"No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball."
Ross Geller,Yay!
Ross Geller,"I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?"
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,Hey man.
Ross Geller,"About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry."
Ross Geller,"Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart."
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,"I am sorry, Chandler."
Ross Geller,73! 72! 71!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Well, who's gonna kiss my sister."
Ross Geller,"Awww, man! Really?"
Ross Geller,That's a good point.
Ross Geller,"Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe."
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,"Well, everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history."
Ross Geller,"Happy New Year, Pheebs!"
Ross Geller,Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Ross Geller,"Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy."
Ross Geller,Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Ross Geller,"In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week."
Ross Geller,Ohh.
Ross Geller,Okay! Hey!
Ross Geller,I just asked that girl out.
Ross Geller,Yes it is. See.
Ross Geller,"That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle."
Ross Geller,"Hi, Pheebs!"
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle."
Ross Geller,"All right, see you later."
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, ""Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."""
Ross Geller,"Okay, seriously, what do you think?"
Ross Geller,"What are you, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,"What, to blind my child?"
Ross Geller,"My God! These pants are burning up! Oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! Are you hot?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, it must just be me then."
Ross Geller,"That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?"
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........
Ross Geller,'Kay!
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,"Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!"
Ross Geller,"Well, you can help me!"
Ross Geller,"Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom..."
Ross Geller,"No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!"
Ross Geller,"Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man."
Ross Geller,"Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?"
Ross Geller,Hold on.
Ross Geller,"They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!"
Ross Geller,What difference does that make?!
Ross Geller,"Dude, what am I gonna..."
Ross Geller,"All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off."
Ross Geller,I had a problem.
Ross Geller,"This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!"
Ross Geller,Look at me!
Ross Geller,"Oh, be-because of the leather pants."
Ross Geller,"Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy."
Ross Geller,"Hey-yeah. Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh, by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks Gunther. STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!"
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, what's going on?"
Ross Geller,No! No! No!
Ross Geller,"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!"
Ross Geller,"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now."
Ross Geller,"That's okay, Joe."
Ross Geller,Oh God!
Ross Geller,"Just, y'know out."
Ross Geller,"I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while."
Ross Geller,"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say..."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I didn't know you would say that."
Ross Geller,"Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids."
Ross Geller,I am gonna see her again.
Ross Geller,Hey guys!
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!"
Ross Geller,Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours. It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Ross Geller,Thanks!
Ross Geller,"Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?"
Ross Geller,Oh...
Ross Geller,This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then...
Ross Geller,Okay. Sometimes I feel...
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,"Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney? So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice."
Ross Geller,OH...MY...GOD!!
Ross Geller,I am now.
Ross Geller,"Dude, we got to talk."
Ross Geller,"I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. What you're-you're not mad?"
Ross Geller,"Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to."
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Sorry.
Ross Geller,This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, how's it going?"
Ross Geller,Is everything okay?
Ross Geller,"Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died."
Ross Geller,Your make-up!
Ross Geller,"What's the part, Anti-man?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, how are you holding up?"
Ross Geller,What happened?
Ross Geller,Wh-what did he say?!
Ross Geller,"Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, ""Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!"" I kinda scared myself."
Ross Geller,"Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings."
Ross Geller,What kind of problem?
Ross Geller,Nooooo!
Ross Geller,"Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes."
Ross Geller,"Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!"
Ross Geller,It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Ross Geller,Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Ross Geller,Ohh.
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,What?! What?!
Ross Geller,"Actually, it looks really good."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants."
Ross Geller,"No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to"
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,A basket of mini-muffins.
Ross Geller,The small one.
Ross Geller,Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Ross Geller,Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
Ross Geller,Noooo.
Ross Geller,Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,"That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline."
Ross Geller,"Well, he had gravity boots."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out. Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?"
Ross Geller,Right.
Ross Geller,"Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but-I'm sorry. I, I can't help but notice you're naked and I applaud you. Man, I wish I was naked. I mean, this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it."
Ross Geller,"A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished."
Ross Geller,Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Ross Geller,Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I-What? No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ross Geller,"Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!"
Ross Geller,What the hell are doing?!!
Ross Geller,"I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!"
Ross Geller,"My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!"
Ross Geller,What? What? What?! You guys knew? You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Ross Geller,You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?
Ross Geller,"Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids..."
Ross Geller,You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Aww.
Ross Geller,Huh.
Ross Geller,Ohh.
Ross Geller,Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Ross Geller,Howard?
Ross Geller,Oh that's nice.
Ross Geller,Oh. Uhh...
Ross Geller,"No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in."
Ross Geller,"Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes."
Ross Geller,"No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard."
Ross Geller,"Yes but too me he's just, man."
Ross Geller,"Ugh, can you believe that guy!"
Ross Geller,"...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles."
Ross Geller,It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Ross Geller,"Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags."
Ross Geller,"Oh, no!"
Ross Geller,"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture."
Ross Geller,Phoebe!
Ross Geller,What are you doing?
Ross Geller,You chipped in?!
Ross Geller,Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!"
Ross Geller,Phoebe?
Ross Geller,Phoebe? Phoebe?
Ross Geller,"Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?"
Ross Geller,"So uh, what did you tell them about me?"
Ross Geller,Ohh.
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,"Ohh, this cake is really good!"
Ross Geller,"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that."
Ross Geller,Oh-no. No. No.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!"
Ross Geller,"No, I will not!"
Ross Geller,"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?"
Ross Geller,"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says, ""Come here to me!"""
Ross Geller,"No! No! No! The ""Come here to me"" is y'know for the ladies."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!"
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together."
Ross Geller,What's that supposed to mean?
Ross Geller,"Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out."
Ross Geller,Yeah! Rach?
Ross Geller,Then tell him quickly.
Ross Geller,"Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!"
Ross Geller,A loser you did it with 298 times!
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go."
Ross Geller,"Okay, go left. Left! Left!"
Ross Geller,"Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it! Okay. You got it?"
Ross Geller,Good-good-good.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?"
Ross Geller,"Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me."
Ross Geller,"Oh great! What, you brought Joey?"
Ross Geller,Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Ross Geller,"Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay Rach, that's you. That's the couch."
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's me."
Ross Geller,No! That's-that's my arm!
Ross Geller,Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Ross Geller,"Come on, Chandler."
Ross Geller,"All right. Okay, here we go!"
Ross Geller,"All right, ready?"

Ross Geller,"Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore."
Ross Geller,"All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again."
Ross Geller,I can't believe that didn't work!
Ross Geller,I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Ross Geller,That's what I'm telling you.
Ross Geller,"This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!"
Ross Geller,"Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit."
Ross Geller,I take it.
Ross Geller,Hey! What's up?
Ross Geller,Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Ross Geller,"Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing."
Ross Geller,Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place. I'm Ross.
Ross Geller,You got ink on your lip.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Who isn't?
Ross Geller,"I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross."

Ross Geller,Okay!
Ross Geller,"So uhh, you ready?"
Ross Geller,Sure. Joey...
Ross Geller,Man! They cannot get enough!
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning."
Ross Geller,"I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings..."
Ross Geller,Okay!!
Ross Geller,"All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Ross Geller,You're not his godfather.
Ross Geller,"Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather."
Ross Geller,Really? That's great!
Ross Geller,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,"
Ross Geller,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Not so good.
Ross Geller,"Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!"
Ross Geller,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?"
Ross Geller,Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it is."
Ross Geller,"No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."
Ross Geller,Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What's up?
Ross Geller,"Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man."
Ross Geller,"Well, you just..."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,"Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,And why wouldn't he get it?
Ross Geller,Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Ross Geller,Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Ross Geller,You're kid's name is Raymond!
Ross Geller,Joey!
Ross Geller,"Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well."
Ross Geller,"No really, I-I am! I feel bad!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson."
Ross Geller,"I think, sub-consciously..."
Ross Geller,"I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part."
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,There you go. Thank you!
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Ross Geller,Wow! How'd you get in there?

Ross Geller,"It was totally flirting. ""Somebody got a haircut """
Ross Geller,"Yeah, right."
Ross Geller,I'm good.
Ross Geller,"And on your anniversary, for shame!"
Ross Geller,Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Ross Geller,"Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it."
Ross Geller,Well...
Ross Geller,"Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place."
Ross Geller,And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...
Ross Geller,"This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat."
Ross Geller,I'll get it! I will get that!
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh. Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys."
Ross Geller,"The uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I'm just saying I like it. The hair."
Ross Geller,You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Ross Geller,"You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!"
Ross Geller,This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Ross Geller,Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Ross Geller,Really?!
Ross Geller,"And thank you, for that."
Ross Geller,"What? What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you."
Ross Geller,"All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! And not the one on the menu!"
Ross Geller,Are you sure?
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?"
Ross Geller,Do you like it?
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'm working on my flirting."
Ross Geller,Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!
Ross Geller,"Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting."
Ross Geller,"You'll see. Okay. Oh, what's-what's her name?"
Ross Geller,"Hey! Oh, we-we can't keep eating like this."
Ross Geller,"Okay, so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?"
Ross Geller,Gas? Wow! Intense.
Ross Geller,"Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?"
Ross Geller,They put that in.
Ross Geller,"The gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak."
Ross Geller,A lot of other gas smells...
Ross Geller,Meth-methane smells...
Ross Geller,Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Ross Geller,Was I talking to her about gas?
Ross Geller,"Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,What do you mean?
Ross Geller,And she just gave you this?
Ross Geller,"Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors."
Ross Geller,Well that I can believe.
Ross Geller,And she's supposed to buy this?!
Ross Geller,Hm-mmm.
Ross Geller,"Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow."
Ross Geller,What? Where?
Ross Geller,What am I looking at?
Ross Geller,Me too!
Ross Geller,"Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!"
Ross Geller,"That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy."
Ross Geller,He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Ross Geller,"Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?"
Ross Geller,It's the-Chandler!!
Ross Geller,So where are we going next?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, no one talks like that!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
Ross Geller,"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
Ross Geller,"Umm, jealous!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, no problem."
Ross Geller,"Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!"
Ross Geller,What is it?
Ross Geller,What? What? What? What is it?
Ross Geller,Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Ross Geller,"Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!"
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car..."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!"
Ross Geller,And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Ross Geller,Wow! I could've died tonight.
Ross Geller,I do have a newfound respect for life.
Ross Geller,"Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?"
Ross Geller,"Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!"
Ross Geller,The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?"
Ross Geller,And somebody took a shot at me!
Ross Geller,"No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now."
Ross Geller,"Okay, why are you here?"
Ross Geller,You talked to her?
Ross Geller,"Well, okay, what-what did she say?"
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!"
Ross Geller,"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily."
Ross Geller,"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!"
Ross Geller,"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?"
Ross Geller,Huh.
Ross Geller,"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day."
Ross Geller,"Hey, thanks Rach."
Ross Geller,Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Ross Geller,"""Hey Ross, it's you!"" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that."
Ross Geller,"Hey umm, was-was Monica here?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I want my money back."
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?"
Ross Geller,"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something."
Ross Geller,I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Ross Geller,"Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island."
Ross Geller,Also an island.
Ross Geller,2:17.
Ross Geller,Are you serious?!
Ross Geller,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Ross Geller,You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Ross Geller,What-what is it?!
Ross Geller,Why is it inside out?!
Ross Geller,How much did you pay for that?
Ross Geller,Yeah? How much?
Ross Geller,ON A CAT??!!!!
Ross Geller,"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}"
Ross Geller,"Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?"
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"I know! Don't switch hands, okay?"
Ross Geller,...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Ross Geller,How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Ross Geller,"Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!"
Ross Geller,"2 hours, 27 minutes."
Ross Geller,Hey Rach!
Ross Geller,Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Ross Geller,Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Ross Geller,"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?"
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,"Baking it didn't help, huh?"
Ross Geller,I'm starving!
Ross Geller,I'm still hungry!
Ross Geller,I am!
Ross Geller,"Oh, thank God!"
Ross Geller,I know. My arm is killing me.
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,"Oh God, here we go!"
Ross Geller,Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!
Ross Geller,"Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?"
Ross Geller,"All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park."
Ross Geller,"All right, bye!"
Ross Geller,Later!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?"
Ross Geller,"I don't know, umm..."
Ross Geller,What's with her?
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Action.
Ross Geller,"Dude, you are sick."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15."
Ross Geller,All right!
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? Pheebs? Hello? Phoebe? Phoe-Phoebe! Come on!"
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!"
Ross Geller,"Well, I don't know."
Ross Geller,"Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?"
Ross Geller,"Okay. So we're, we're good?"
Ross Geller,"All right. I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?"
Ross Geller,ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!
Ross Geller,"Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?"
Ross Geller,Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Ross Geller,Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'm the baby."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?"
Ross Geller,What do you like better flora or fauna?
Ross Geller,Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Ross Geller,Why are you mad at me?
Ross Geller,When did I say you were boring?!
Ross Geller,Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Ross Geller,"Hey Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this."
Ross Geller,What'd you say?
Ross Geller,Is that supposed to be an insult?
Ross Geller,"So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday."
Ross Geller,Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Ross Geller,"Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes-Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?"
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,May I come in?
Ross Geller,Do you want me too?
Ross Geller,"So do I. Okay Rach, before anything happens I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us."" Okay? I just want this to be about what it is!"
Ross Geller,The physical act of love.
Ross Geller,Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Ross Geller,You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Ross Geller,No! No! No! No-no-no-no.
Ross Geller,"Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?"
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,"All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack."
Ross Geller,Yep! That's hilarious!
Ross Geller,"Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too."
Ross Geller,Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Ross Geller,What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Ross Geller,Is that so?
Ross Geller,Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom!
Ross Geller,Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
Ross Geller,What the? What...
Ross Geller,"Ohh, it was the best!"
Ross Geller,I think the check in is that way.
Ross Geller,Phoebe!
Ross Geller,"Hey, you wet my pants!"
Ross Geller,Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people."
Ross Geller,"What? No-no, a lurker."
Ross Geller,"Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then..."
Ross Geller,No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Ross Geller,Uh-hmm.
Ross Geller,My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance-karate lessons.
Ross Geller,"Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,"Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?"
Ross Geller,Joey!!
Ross Geller,Thanks man.
Ross Geller,"Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie."
Ross Geller,Your what?
Ross Geller,What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Ross Geller,"Yes, hello. I have a question. Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face. A beard and a moustache. Thank you. No, she didn't think so. I know it's like anyway, umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do? Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Okay. Okay, thank you! Yeah, it's not coming off."
Ross Geller,"Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So... Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it."
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad."
Ross Geller,"Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here! There are tons...of...freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice, I swear!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, there was some staring and pointing."
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. But who cares?! Because it's all on me! That is, one big drink!"
Ross Geller,Umm... Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Ross Geller,"Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?"
Ross Geller,"All right. Y'know what? We don't have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us! All right, come on, come on, we'll play some blackjack. Here we go. 13."
Ross Geller,"Oohh, 23. Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!"
Ross Geller,You're right!
Ross Geller,We need more cards.
Ross Geller,That must be our alcohol and beers!
Ross Geller,"Ohh, it's Joey! I love Joey!"
Ross Geller,"I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?"
Ross Geller,"Ohh, here's that Macadamia nut!"
Ross Geller,Nope! Something else.
Ross Geller,"I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I...I really miss downstairs."
Ross Geller,Well hello! I'm Ross!
Ross Geller,"Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here."
Ross Geller,Hello!
Ross Geller,"Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!"
Ross Geller,"Well, hello, Mrs. Ross!"
Ross Geller,Why are we in bed together?
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur."
Ross Geller,And we didn't have sex.
Ross Geller,Tell me about it.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
Ross Geller,We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
Ross Geller,I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Ross Geller,"Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?"
Ross Geller,I'm not going to do that.
Ross Geller,"Yes, exactly!"
Ross Geller,"Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more."
Ross Geller,"I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!"
Ross Geller,I'm asking you to do me a favor.
Ross Geller,And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!"
Ross Geller,I don't know if it's true.
Ross Geller,"Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage..."
Ross Geller,"All right. All right, I'll do it."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of."
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, why not?"
Ross Geller,"Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?"
Ross Geller,I didn't get the annulment.
Ross Geller,We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of."
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, why not?"
Ross Geller,"Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?"
Ross Geller,I didn't get the annulment.
Ross Geller,We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Ross Geller,"Hey, do you have any gum?"
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, ""Three divorces. Three divorces!"" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces."
Ross Geller,"Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!"
Ross Geller,"Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?"
Ross Geller,Hey! Hi!
Ross Geller,What's up?
Ross Geller,"Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great."
Ross Geller,Bye.
Ross Geller,"Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!"
Ross Geller,"No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists."
Ross Geller,Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Ross Geller,What?! Why?
Ross Geller,"And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross."
Ross Geller,"...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?"
Ross Geller,"We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!"
Ross Geller,"Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times."
Ross Geller,"Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!"
Ross Geller,Yes.
Ross Geller,"Yes, second in two years. Third overall."
Ross Geller,"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk..."
Ross Geller,"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her."
Ross Geller,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Ross Geller,I think just the annulment for today.
Ross Geller,Easy.
Ross Geller,No problem.
Ross Geller,"Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of."
Ross Geller,"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy."
Ross Geller,Oh no.
Ross Geller,I couldn't.
Ross Geller,It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...
Ross Geller,"I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?"
Ross Geller,I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Ross Geller,"Ohh, what's wrong?!"
Ross Geller,Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Ross Geller,Of course.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend."
Ross Geller,"It's nothing, I just gave her a hug."
Ross Geller,It's also a sign of friendship.
Ross Geller,It was a hug!
Ross Geller,S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ross Geller,"I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!"
Ross Geller,"If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?"
Ross Geller,"Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number."
Ross Geller,"Okay, you go grab it!"
Ross Geller,I don't know what you're talking about.
Ross Geller,"Look, I do not re-love her."
Ross Geller,"Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?"
Ross Geller,You can live with me.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out."
Ross Geller,"Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right."
Ross Geller,"Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?"
Ross Geller,"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff."
Ross Geller,"What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?"
Ross Geller,What?! Over a stupid room!
Ross Geller,"Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!"
Ross Geller,"What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!"
Ross Geller,"Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!"
Ross Geller,"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?"
Ross Geller,"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?"
Ross Geller,"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?"
Ross Geller,Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
Ross Geller,Hey Rach!
Ross Geller,"You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again."
Ross Geller,"Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?"
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,"No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?"
Ross Geller,Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Ross Geller,Really?! We are?
Ross Geller,Ohh! That would be great.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I didn't think of that."
Ross Geller,So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!
Ross Geller,"No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!"
Ross Geller,"Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!"
Ross Geller,"So umm, where are the other guys?"
Ross Geller,Fighting?!
Ross Geller,"Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?"
Ross Geller,Sure! Here.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind."
Ross Geller,I've been back and forth.
Ross Geller,"Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right."
Ross Geller,Is that what I want?
Ross Geller,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!"
Ross Geller,"How weird is that? Y'know? You're moving in with me and have the one thing I don't have. It's like uh, in a way you-you complete me kitchen."
Ross Geller,"You complete me kitchen, matey!"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Oh...my...God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Ross Geller,"Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you're obsessed with her. It's always, ""Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?"" ""Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"" You want her!"
Ross Geller,"Uh-oh, saved by the bell. Hello?"
Ross Geller,"No-no-no, that's great! I'll be there Monday. And thank you again! Okay. Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!"
Ross Geller,"Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it."
Ross Geller,"I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it's temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? ""Professor Geller."""
Ross Geller,Hey everyone!
Ross Geller,"Hey uh, well, today's my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?"
Ross Geller,"""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct..."""
Ross Geller,"""...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is..."""
Ross Geller,No! Why?
Ross Geller,"Ohh! Okay! Okay. ""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into..."""
Ross Geller,"Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club!"
Ross Geller,Okay!
Ross Geller,Thank you!
Ross Geller,Please don't say naked chicks.
Ross Geller,I-I-I don't even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y'know what? I'm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Ross Geller,Hello!
Ross Geller,It went great! And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Ross Geller,"I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone's all, ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I'm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler."
Ross Geller,That's right!
Ross Geller,"Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when- Oh bloody hell."
Ross Geller,"Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out."
Ross Geller,Will you-will you please?
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister."
Ross Geller,"Right, will you excuse us for one moment? What are you doing?"
Ross Geller,Just please stop!
Ross Geller,"Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?"
Ross Geller,They're not listening too me?
Ross Geller,Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Ross Geller,"All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point? Yes."
Ross Geller,"Come again? What's-what's this nonsense? All right, I'm-I'm not English. I'm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I'm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? About paleontology. All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I'm-I'm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression..."
Ross Geller,"Well, hello Rachel!"
Ross Geller,Look I was going to tell you!
Ross Geller,"Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision. But I just couldn't face another failed marriage."
Ross Geller,"Rach, come on, if you think about it, it's actually kinda funny. Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it."
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, I told her you already knew."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I'll take care of everything."
Ross Geller,"Okay Rach, but..."
Ross Geller,Look I told you...
Ross Geller,"Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand!"
Ross Geller,What about the time I said we were on a break?
Ross Geller,"Fine, I'm mentally unstable."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!"
Ross Geller,And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Ross Geller,"That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!"
Ross Geller,And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Ross Geller,That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Ross Geller,The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Ross Geller,"I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign."
Ross Geller,"Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!"
Ross Geller,Yeah! Right!
Ross Geller,"You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, can we just sign please?"
Ross Geller,Congratulations.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Excuse me?
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault."
Ross Geller,"I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you."
Ross Geller,"Did I, did I even treat?"
Ross Geller,That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Ross Geller,"Eh, no problem."
Ross Geller,Totally.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it."
Ross Geller,I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Ross Geller,"Oh, but-but I can't do it."
Ross Geller,"Because, because I've got Ben."
Ross Geller,"Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?"
Ross Geller,I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi."
Ross Geller,"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later."
Ross Geller,"Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack."
Ross Geller,And now you want that money back.
Ross Geller,"Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?"
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square."
Ross Geller,"Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine."
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?"
Ross Geller,Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her."
Ross Geller,"Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?"
Ross Geller,Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Ross Geller,Put it back exactly where you found it?
Ross Geller,"'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?"
Ross Geller,"Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me."
Ross Geller,"Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak...out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there."
Ross Geller,"Yeah that-that, doesn't look right."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet."
Ross Geller,"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I've been married 3 times"
Ross Geller,"Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"""
Ross Geller,"Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science."
Ross Geller,"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar."
Ross Geller,They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Ross Geller,I'm never gonna find love again.
Ross Geller,Who cares? I repel women.
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,Why does anyone have to be naked?
Ross Geller,I-I had to show Chandler something?
Ross Geller,"Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem."
Ross Geller,"Dude, what'd you have?"
Ross Geller,The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Ross Geller,"So really, what'd ya have?"
Ross Geller,Bye!
Ross Geller,"So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer..."
Ross Geller,"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing."
Ross Geller,"Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?"
Ross Geller,The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Ross Geller,"Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?"
Ross Geller,Maybe it's a universal thing?
Ross Geller,Hey guys.
Ross Geller,What's up?
Ross Geller,I whitened them.
Ross Geller,Yeah. What do you think.
Ross Geller,"Come on, seriously."
Ross Geller,"Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to."
Ross Geller,A-A day.
Ross Geller,"I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh..."
Ross Geller,I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Ross Geller,Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Ross Geller,Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
Ross Geller,"But, won't she notice I have makeup on?"
Ross Geller,What??
Ross Geller,No. I am not putting on makeup.
Ross Geller,Mmm-Hmm.
Ross Geller,Mmm.
Ross Geller,Mm-Hmm.
Ross Geller,Hmm-Hmm.
Ross Geller,Mmm-Unmm.
Ross Geller,"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm."
Ross Geller,Mmm.
Ross Geller,"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know."
Ross Geller,"Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm."
Ross Geller,Hmm-Hmm.
Ross Geller,Mmm-Hmm.
Ross Geller,How about all the way.
Ross Geller,"Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?"
Ross Geller,"Ohh, you can see them, huh?"
Ross Geller,"I-I, did that for you."
Ross Geller,What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
Ross Geller,"Yes, of course they like you!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, they don't like you."
Ross Geller,"I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-"
Ross Geller,"No I don't want to play video games, Joey!"
Ross Geller,For real?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that."
Ross Geller,And the place looks so nice!
Ross Geller,Happy Thanksgiving!
Ross Geller,See ya!
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having."
Ross Geller,"Some would say she's attractive, yes."
Ross Geller,"Dude, we were good!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, what is it?"
Ross Geller,W-What was the one right before bananas?
Ross Geller,"Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!"
Ross Geller,"Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!"
Ross Geller,"No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!"
Ross Geller,"Dude, I need to talk to you a sec."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you."
Ross Geller,"Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window."
Ross Geller,"I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter."
Ross Geller,"How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?"
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I-I was all high."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?"
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, fine!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay."
Ross Geller,"What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!"
Ross Geller,"Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?"
Ross Geller,"So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?"
Ross Geller,And um...You look nice today.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Eh?
Ross Geller,You're alone.
Ross Geller,"Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!"
Ross Geller,Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
Ross Geller,It tastes like feet!
Ross Geller,Are you kidding?
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter."
Ross Geller,Wha-what?
Ross Geller,"You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?"
Ross Geller,Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!"
Ross Geller,Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross Geller,"I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!"
Ross Geller,Hey
Ross Geller,"Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?"
Ross Geller,"... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago."
Ross Geller,"I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like OLD NEWS!"
Ross Geller,Hi Janine!
Ross Geller,You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Ross Geller,"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that."
Ross Geller,Are you serious?
Ross Geller,Bye Janine!
Ross Geller,It was a dry day.
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,Got it!
Ross Geller,Oh my God it's just like I dreamed it!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?"
Ross Geller,Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Ross Geller,Why do they keep doing that?
Ross Geller,Right.
Ross Geller,"Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?"
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,We know!
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Monica! Would it?
Ross Geller,"Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform!"
Ross Geller,The routine!
Ross Geller,"Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he'll wanna build us our own platform!"
Ross Geller,"We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it's almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?"
Ross Geller,"So, do we really have to ask who's going up on the platform next?"
Ross Geller,Can you believe this? We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,"Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?"
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,You kissed her.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,You like it?
Ross Geller,It's my new apothecary table!
Ross Geller,Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Ross Geller,Why did you do that?
Ross Geller,She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Ross Geller,"What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!"
Ross Geller,"Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!"
Ross Geller,Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross Geller,Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?"
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?"
Ross Geller,My apothecary table!!!
Ross Geller,I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Ross Geller,"Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way."
Ross Geller,Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Ross Geller,A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Ross Geller,Fascinating.
Ross Geller,"Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?"
Ross Geller,"Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff."
Ross Geller,She does want to.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Y'know what would cheer you up?
Ross Geller,"I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come."
Ross Geller,"Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures."
Ross Geller,"Here, check it out. It's the first one, too."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did."
Ross Geller,"Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?"
Ross Geller,"No, it's my joke, it's mine. You can call them, they'll tell you."
Ross Geller,It's my joke.
Ross Geller,"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard."
Ross Geller,"What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey."
Ross Geller,"Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars."
Ross Geller,"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer."
Ross Geller,"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?"
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm not going to go now anyway ."
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out."
Ross Geller,"Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?"
Ross Geller,"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it."
Ross Geller,"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?"
Ross Geller,It's my joke.
Ross Geller,"Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Hey Mon.
Ross Geller,Monica!
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world."
Ross Geller,We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.
Ross Geller,"See, I would never snap at you like that."
Ross Geller,"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!"
Ross Geller,It's your joke.
Ross Geller,No way.
Ross Geller,"Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?"
Ross Geller,Hey does anyone have any gum?
Ross Geller,Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
Ross Geller,Hi Jill.
Ross Geller,"Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card."
Ross Geller,I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Ross Geller,Sorry-sorry Jill.
Ross Geller,"Huh? Oh, I got this--this!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!"
Ross Geller,"Ross, wants a pajmena?"
Ross Geller,It's a rug.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one."
Ross Geller,Well. Hey...
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, how about you and the, ""I'm sorry!"""
Ross Geller,Oh stop.
Ross Geller,"No, you stop!"
Ross Geller,Rach? Hi!
Ross Geller,Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Ross Geller,"Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, ""Why not?!"""
Ross Geller,"I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing."
Ross Geller,Hi Jill!
Ross Geller,Hi .
Ross Geller,"Rachel! Well, you-you're not at home, you're-you're-you're right here."
Ross Geller,"Okay. So well I'll umm, I'll have her home by midnight."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun."
Ross Geller,I guess so.
Ross Geller,"No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils."
Ross Geller,Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Ross Geller,"Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean."
Ross Geller,"Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again."
Ross Geller,I mean after tomorrow night.
Ross Geller,Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ross Geller,You want me to call her right now?
Ross Geller,"Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!"
Ross Geller,"Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?"
Ross Geller,"And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there."
Ross Geller,Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Ross Geller,"You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?"
Ross Geller,"Of course, what happened?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, umm..."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Wow! Really?!
Ross Geller,"Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!"
Ross Geller,Ohh!
Ross Geller,Slides are almost ready.
Ross Geller,"Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen."
Ross Geller,Hello?
Ross Geller,"O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking."
Ross Geller,So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me."
Ross Geller,"You uh, you may have been right about Jill."
Ross Geller,"Umm, she kissed me."
Ross Geller,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?"
Ross Geller,"Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking..."
Ross Geller,Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Ross Geller,Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Ross Geller,"No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector."
Ross Geller,You're welcome.
Ross Geller,You take care Jill.
Ross Geller,"I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced."
Ross Geller,"The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian."
Ross Geller,"I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical."
Ross Geller,"No, I just think Monica was that fat."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,"Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?"
Ross Geller,Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Ross Geller,"No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!"
Ross Geller,"No, no-no, Ross Geller."
Ross Geller,Yeah. Right.
Ross Geller,"Good-good, I'm-I'm married."
Ross Geller,Is-isn't it the best?
Ross Geller,"Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi."
Ross Geller,"Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!"
Ross Geller,Come on!
Ross Geller,"No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't..."
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!"
Ross Geller,Hey Mon!
Ross Geller,"Mon, look who I ran into!"
Ross Geller,"And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler."
Ross Geller,And that's Phoebe over there!
Ross Geller,"1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."
Ross Geller,"Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other..."
Ross Geller,"Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!"
Ross Geller,"Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks."
Ross Geller,"Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Well, last weekend..."
Ross Geller,...will be two months...
Ross Geller,...since I stopped trying.
Ross Geller,What-what do you mean?
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,"Okay, I think I got it."
Ross Geller,"So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there."
Ross Geller,"Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little."
Ross Geller,Carol our sex life is-it's just not working...
Ross Geller,"Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don't we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don't you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!"
Ross Geller,"Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?"
Ross Geller,"Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome."
Ross Geller,Come on. I got it.
Ross Geller,I got it!
Ross Geller,"Hello? No she can't come to the phone right now. Oh, right no problem. Okay, bye-bye."
Ross Geller,"J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, she's fired."
Ross Geller,"So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find..."
Ross Geller,"Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep."
Ross Geller,Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
Ross Geller,"Hey, Pheebs!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, how's it going?"
Ross Geller,"She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?"
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job."
Ross Geller,"We're really gonna do this, huh?"
Ross Geller,"Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at..."
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Ross Geller,How hot is this?!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Look at you! You're up!
Ross Geller,Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
Ross Geller,No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"It was, it was okay."
Ross Geller,"Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, ""Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"""
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, absolutely!"
Ross Geller,"It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around."
Ross Geller,Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Ross Geller,"No, she kept kicking me away!"
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,Oh I a lot of stuff!
Ross Geller,A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Ross Geller,"Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard..."
Ross Geller,It really was!
Ross Geller,Hey Rachel.
Ross Geller,"Umm, no."
Ross Geller,That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,We're sorry.
Ross Geller,Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
Ross Geller,"Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that."
Ross Geller,Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Ross Geller,Men. I guy I know.
Ross Geller,She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
Ross Geller,I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
Ross Geller,Try telling my wife that.
Ross Geller,"Hey, remember when I had a monkey?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, what, what was I thinking?"
Ross Geller,What's up with the greed Joe?
Ross Geller,"Well isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can't-can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!"
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Hey, what have you guys been up to?"
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,After one class? I don't think so.
Ross Geller,"Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that's not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there's a concept you should really be familiar with. It's what the Japanese call unagi."
Ross Geller,"No, it's a concept!"
Ross Geller,"All right, maybe it means that too..."
Ross Geller,Y'know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don't even care!
Ross Geller,Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Ross Geller,"All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don't know, like a surprise!!"
Ross Geller,"All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi."
Ross Geller,Y'know what...
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,So what are you gonna do?
Ross Geller,DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Ross Geller,A lesson in the importance of unagi.
Ross Geller,"Perhaps. Now I'm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?"
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I-look, I just want you guys to be safe. DANGER!!!!! Ahhh, huh? Unagi."
Ross Geller,Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Ross Geller,Unagi. I'm always aware.
Ross Geller,What's up?
Ross Geller,"Oh, why don't you make her one of your little jokes."
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? She'd-she'd love this. Uh, it's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade."
Ross Geller,"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
Ross Geller,Why not?
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,It's not something you are! It's something you have!
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!"
Ross Geller,It's a great class.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, I was watching. Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?"
Ross Geller,No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Ross Geller,Yes that's right.
Ross Geller,"I tired attacking two women, did not work."
Ross Geller,"No, I mean it's okay, I mean, they're-they're my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them."
Ross Geller,"Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Maybe we could attack them together? That-that's a no."
Ross Geller,"Ah-ha, nowhere to run!"
Ross Geller,DANGER!!!!
Ross Geller,"Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, ""I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"""
Ross Geller,"Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student."
Ross Geller,"No, but it is frowned upon."
Ross Geller,"Besides, there's a big age difference."
Ross Geller,I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
Ross Geller,That was you?
Ross Geller,"Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea."
Ross Geller,What time?
Ross Geller,Gotcha.
Ross Geller,"Oh! So-so seriously, what time?"
Ross Geller,"What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson."
Ross Geller,"Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt."
Ross Geller,"Umm, no. No."
Ross Geller,"Umm, it's Cutie McPretty."
Ross Geller,"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all."
Ross Geller,Burt!
Ross Geller,"We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!"
Ross Geller,"Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou."
Ross Geller,Yeah. What-what should I do?
Ross Geller,Going out with who?
Ross Geller,Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh...
Ross Geller,What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Ross Geller,"Oh, you have some studying to do?"
Ross Geller,"Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to..."
Ross Geller,"Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!"
Ross Geller,"What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?"
Ross Geller,"What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth."
Ross Geller,"That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Ross Geller,Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Ross Geller,"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,"Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong."
Ross Geller,No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
Ross Geller,Let's also get a hot plate!
Ross Geller,Hey everybody!
Ross Geller,"Hey uh, this is Elizabeth."
Ross Geller,"Oh no-no-no, we're just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house."
Ross Geller,Bye.
Ross Geller,Oh that is quite all right ma'am.
Ross Geller,"Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow."
Ross Geller,Anyone else? Huh? Bring 'em on!
Ross Geller,"I don't know Rachel, why?"
Ross Geller,Well thanks!
Ross Geller,"Well, actually it's been great. She's 20 so she's not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now."
Ross Geller,"Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are..."
Ross Geller,"Hmm? Oh, a student I don't know."
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?"
Ross Geller,"Shh! Of course, why don't we go inside?"
Ross Geller,Oh-ooh!
Ross Geller,Doorknob! Doorknob!
Ross Geller,"Oh, okay. What-what about?"
Ross Geller,Spring vacation.
Ross Geller,"Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger... I'll be with you in one moment. So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints."
Ross Geller,"You don't understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I'm not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?"
Ross Geller,"I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?"
Ross Geller,What the hell are you doing?
Ross Geller,"What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!"
Ross Geller,"Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while."
Ross Geller,Do not give him any money!
Ross Geller,"Yes. Yes! Please, come in."
Ross Geller,Oo-oo!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it kinda grows on you. Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation."
Ross Geller,"Look, I... Look, I'm having a great time with you and I just don't want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I'm sorry I just don't think we should go away together yet. It's-it's too soon."
Ross Geller,No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was...
Ross Geller,That! Let's talk about that.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation."
Ross Geller,What's-what's the difference?
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what? Not all spring breaks are like that."
Ross Geller,I went to Egypt with my dad.
Ross Geller,"Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, ""Spring break!"" All right? I mean she's taken my class!"
Ross Geller,I'm gonna call her.
Ross Geller,"Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know..."
Ross Geller,"Okay, she can't go."
Ross Geller,Then what am I supposed to do?
Ross Geller,"Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?"
Ross Geller,I'm so glad you're going on this trip!
Ross Geller,"Sure. Sure. Look I don't, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam."
Ross Geller,Are you into crafts at all?
Ross Geller,"Well, yeah, of-of course I'm okay! What? I'm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and what-what is uh, what's this?"
Ross Geller,To wear in front of people?
Ross Geller,Is this?!
Ross Geller,"So uh, have a great time down there."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?"
Ross Geller,"It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it's revealing which I'm fine with, no I'm concerned about your health, sun exposure."
Ross Geller,"Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's-it's get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it's just milk."
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,Okay. Cool.
Ross Geller,Call me!
Ross Geller,Excuse me?
Ross Geller,"You're right, you're right, it is."
Ross Geller,So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Ross Geller,It's your turn.
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?"
Ross Geller,Totally!
Ross Geller,Great!
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,"Oh, I love that guy!"
Ross Geller,What am I doing?
Ross Geller,"Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs."
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,You ate my sandwich?
Ross Geller,Oh-oh really?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away!
Ross Geller,MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross Geller,MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes it is. In prison!"
Ross Geller,It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Ross Geller,I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Ross Geller,I fell asleep!
Ross Geller,"It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'"
Ross Geller,FINE BY ME!!
Ross Geller,"That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!"
Ross Geller,"There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired."
Ross Geller,Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac...
Ross Geller,Oh my God. I mean...
Ross Geller,Totally.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What are you guys doing later?
Ross Geller,I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Ross Geller,"Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good."
Ross Geller,Thanks!
Ross Geller,It-it's great to meet you Paul.
Ross Geller,"Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens."
Ross Geller,Eh-wh-Excuse me?
Ross Geller,That's funny. Umm.... It's not funny.
Ross Geller,"Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,This is-you-
Ross Geller,"Okay, umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean, I mean I've been in um, relationships in general, uh but I have never done it with a student-I mean I not-not it! I mean, I mean I don't-We haven't done it. Uh, I mean, I mean, we've-we've-we've done stuff. Okay, okay, a joke, a joke-lighten the mood. Umm, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish."
Ross Geller,And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Ross Geller,"Oh God, thank you! Umm, uh, Mr. Stevens I'd like you to meet my friends uh, this is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler."
Ross Geller,"Okay umm, why don't we all take a seat, y'know? And uh, and I'll get us all some uh some coffees--Yeah, why don't you. Uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. Y'know? Whatever pops into your head."
Ross Geller,"Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about."
Ross Geller,Joey?!
Ross Geller,Joey?! Joey!!
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!"
Ross Geller,Oh! Oh my God! I didn't even see you!
Ross Geller,What-what-what the-how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Ross Geller,In your mouth?!
Ross Geller,You were at the coffeehouse!
Ross Geller,"He is my girlfriend's father, okay? It's-it's, it's weird!"
Ross Geller,That was different!
Ross Geller,This is weird for me!
Ross Geller,How is that important?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, take your time."
Ross Geller,Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as-as...
Ross Geller,Not all bad.
Ross Geller,Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Ross Geller,"No! No! Not-I don't mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who's umm six and I still think of him as a baby."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife! Oh, I'm sorry! It's unbelievable!"
Ross Geller,You're back.
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? I-I-I... I-I have had enough of this! Y'know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you've got a problem with me, frankly..."
Ross Geller,God no!
Ross Geller,"Well if it doesn't matter to her, it doesn't matter to me! Still not yelling!"
Ross Geller,"That's okay, I'm not so crazy about myself right now either."
Ross Geller,"Uh yeah, I guess-Yeah! I guess so."
Ross Geller,Ohhh! Kids!
Ross Geller,"That's okay Rach, we're not liking Ross right now."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Why? What?
Ross Geller,"No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear."
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and..."
Ross Geller,"Really? That okay, that's great."
Ross Geller,"All right look, I-I realize it upsets you."
Ross Geller,"But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it."
Ross Geller,Ohh! A man with a plan!
Ross Geller,This place is really beautiful!
Ross Geller,"Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?"
Ross Geller,"Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father."
Ross Geller,"No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot."
Ross Geller,"Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,A little bit.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Ohh, okay."
Ross Geller,What are you doing here?!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I recognize the ankles!"
Ross Geller,You and your ice.
Ross Geller,Did you really hear a bear?
Ross Geller,"Elizabeth! Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window. I'll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you're going home, okay?"
Ross Geller,And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross Geller,"Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain..."
Ross Geller,"All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy."
Ross Geller,And I too am just a love machine.
Ross Geller,"Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go."
Ross Geller,How rude.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,Great to see you!
Ross Geller,How you doing?
Ross Geller,Okay! You take care!
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?"
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, why'd you do it?"
Ross Geller,What?! Why?!
Ross Geller,I can't think of anything.
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?"
Ross Geller,I guess it could.
Ross Geller,"Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth."
Ross Geller,"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?"
Ross Geller,Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Ross Geller,"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago."
Ross Geller,"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him."
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,All the time?
Ross Geller,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!"
Ross Geller,That's right!
Ross Geller,Eh? We'll show him!
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?"
Ross Geller,So you two are really serious?!
Ross Geller,You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
Ross Geller,Hey-hey Pheebs!
Ross Geller,Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Ross Geller,You told her before you told us?
Ross Geller,God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you didn't get one."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth."
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!"
Ross Geller,I don't know.
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?"
Ross Geller,"Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah you have the ring?"
Ross Geller,Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
Ross Geller,What's-what's going on?
Ross Geller,"Oh, you have to call the police! That's what I did to the kids in my building!"
Ross Geller,"Oh! Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight. Umm, it's supposed to be excellent. The director is the same..."
Ross Geller,"No! Okay! Okay! Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?"
Ross Geller,"Uh, so this play umm, what do you think? It's-it's gotten great reviews! Y'know the uh..."
Ross Geller,Everybody put their balloons down!!! Now this is a nice suit!!
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, you guys!!"
Ross Geller,Who?
Ross Geller,What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight."
Ross Geller,"Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do."
Ross Geller,"Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is."
Ross Geller,Hmm.
Ross Geller,"Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and..."
Ross Geller,"No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her."
Ross Geller,"I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part."
Ross Geller,Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross Geller,"Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about..."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,"Okay, break-up's still on!"
Ross Geller,What happened you guys?
Ross Geller,Rach!
Ross Geller,"Hey, come on in."
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be."
Ross Geller,I guess so.
Ross Geller,Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Ross Geller,"Ohh, yeah I already have one."
Ross Geller,Phoebe.
Ross Geller,"Ohh, I don't think so."
Ross Geller,"That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!"
Ross Geller,I was not!
Ross Geller,No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
Ross Geller,"Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!"
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,"Hey, what's going on?"
Ross Geller,"I found a note on my door, ""Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."""
Ross Geller,What's up?
Ross Geller,Oh my God. Congratulations.
Ross Geller,Where is she?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, ""I'm gay! I'm gay!"" Can I bring her in?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Wow! Happy Monica's night!
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,Well sure. But I get married all the time so...
Ross Geller,You okay?
Ross Geller,"You mean, we-you and me?"
Ross Geller,"Oh good, you scared me for a minute."
Ross Geller,"I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times."
Ross Geller,Surely you can think of something good.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Ross Geller,My hands?
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too."
Ross Geller,A what?
Ross Geller,"One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?"
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't."
Ross Geller,"Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw..."
Ross Geller,It is! It is!
Ross Geller,Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,It was just a kiss.
Ross Geller,Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
Ross Geller,Oh no!
Ross Geller,And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
Ross Geller,Guess who?
Ross Geller,"Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air..."
Ross Geller,Still thinking about it huh?
Ross Geller,"Oh, who cares?"
Ross Geller,And so do I.
Ross Geller,Okay. Sure.
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,"Hey, here's a thought."
Ross Geller,Got me.
Ross Geller,"Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off."
Ross Geller,"Look uh, if we're gonna do this..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I see, so everybody wins."
Ross Geller,Oww!
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man."
Ross Geller,"And uh, Rachel."
Ross Geller,"What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me."
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'll have some!"
Ross Geller,"Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name."
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!"
Ross Geller,And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at...
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?"
Ross Geller,"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?"
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent!"
Ross Geller,Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Ross Geller,"Uh, Phoebe..."
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,Phoebe!
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!"
Ross Geller,And they knew about it?
Ross Geller,"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!"
Ross Geller,"The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer."
Ross Geller,Hello.
Ross Geller,"Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night."
Ross Geller,"Can I, can I help you with something?"
Ross Geller,Yes I am.
Ross Geller,"Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft."
Ross Geller,"Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?"
Ross Geller,"Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?"
Ross Geller,So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?"
Ross Geller,Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
Ross Geller,I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Ross Geller,"Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop."
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment."
Ross Geller,"He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,His daughter was hot.
Ross Geller,About what?
Ross Geller,"Well, you-you've always had glasses."
Ross Geller,Are you sure?
Ross Geller,"Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?"
Ross Geller,"No, why?"
Ross Geller,My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Ross Geller,"Yeah and he didn't really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you."
Ross Geller,"No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way."
Ross Geller,Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,You're not a lefty?
Ross Geller,"Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?"
Ross Geller,No one got me an engagement present.
Ross Geller,Two! I've been engaged twice!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand..."
Ross Geller,And what did he ask you not to call him?
Ross Geller,Over here.
Ross Geller,'Cause otherwise they'd have to call it the room room.
Ross Geller,"Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp."
Ross Geller,Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Ross Geller,You were trying to eat it!
Ross Geller,"Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?"
Ross Geller,Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Ross Geller,Thank you!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Yeeeeeep... Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad's boat she wouldn't let me help at all.
Ross Geller,You have to respect the sea!
Ross Geller,Let's give it a shot.
Ross Geller,"Ohh, these are pretty good."
Ross Geller,Which one was that?
Ross Geller,Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. I'm okay.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh... It's batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way!"
Ross Geller,Looking up?
Ross Geller,"Aww, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?"
Ross Geller,"That's the day you're gonna die? See-darnit, I've got shuffleboard that day."
Ross Geller,Ohhhh...
Ross Geller,It wasn't the best.
Ross Geller,"Well, the lighting was okay."
Ross Geller,"Oh great! That means I'm stuck with, ""So, we were watching you in there and you were sittin' right here! Whoa!"""
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, nothin' much. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner."
Ross Geller,"Hey-Ooh! What's-what's that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?"
Ross Geller,What you got over there? Tacos?
Ross Geller,"Uhh, those are tacos."
Ross Geller,"Eh, either way I'll pass. I still can't eat those. What's so funny?!"
Ross Geller,You told her!
Ross Geller,"Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It's not like I choose to do it! It's not like-It's not like I said, ""Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"""
Ross Geller,How could you tell her?!
Ross Geller,Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Ross Geller,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar..."
Ross Geller,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with...girls."
Ross Geller,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard..."
Ross Geller,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
Ross Geller,All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross Geller,"Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!"
Ross Geller,"Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made."
Ross Geller,Monica couldn't tell time 'til she was 13!
Ross Geller,"Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!"
Ross Geller,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy."
Ross Geller,"And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!"
Ross Geller,"And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else."
Ross Geller,"Okay, if you'll excuse me, I-I'm gonna go hang out with some people who don't know the Space Mountain story."
Ross Geller,Man!
Ross Geller,"Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh..."
Ross Geller,Amazing!
Ross Geller,"Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees."
Ross Geller,It's not a club.
Ross Geller,"Hey, divorced men are not bad men!"
Ross Geller,"Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired."
Ross Geller,Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Ross Geller,I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Ross Geller,"I like this one. It seems to say, ""I love you and that's why I have to kill you."""
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,What?! No!
Ross Geller,"Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend."
Ross Geller,All right! I want my key back!
Ross Geller,It's right there!
Ross Geller,"Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs."
Ross Geller,Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
Ross Geller,Hi Whitney.
Ross Geller,Yep. Okay.
Ross Geller,"Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night."
Ross Geller,Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Ross Geller,Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
Ross Geller,Like what?
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me..."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, ""I don't give a tiny rat's ass."""
Ross Geller,"Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!"
Ross Geller,I think he can be.
Ross Geller,"Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!"
Ross Geller,I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Ross Geller,So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
Ross Geller,My God!
Ross Geller,Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Ross Geller,Wh-what's up?
Ross Geller,Oh just say it Kyle!
Ross Geller,"Y'know, he hums when he pees!"
Ross Geller,"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
Ross Geller,"That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already."
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, were better off without them."
Ross Geller,Divorced men's club.
Ross Geller,"Joey, we just saw it!"
Ross Geller,And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Dude, you didn't say Die Hard. Is everything okay?"
Ross Geller,"Well, John McLane had plans!"
Ross Geller,What happened?!!
Ross Geller,We fell asleep! That is all.
Ross Geller,I think that would be best.
Ross Geller,Okay. But not about this!
Ross Geller,No touch! No touch!
Ross Geller,"Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio."
Ross Geller,"Just uh, brought back your videos."
Ross Geller,No! No we don't!
Ross Geller,I... I don't know what you are talking about.
Ross Geller,I've had better.
Ross Geller,All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Ross Geller,I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!
Ross Geller,We can't do it again.
Ross Geller,Because it's weird!
Ross Geller,"Sure, what do you got?"
Ross Geller,"No, 10 is the highest."
Ross Geller,"Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!"
Ross Geller,"Yes, very nice Rachel."
Ross Geller,"When Monica was a little girl, I remember that--Ooh!! Ow! Very good!"
Ross Geller,It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Ross Geller,Go!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it really was!"
Ross Geller,"Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point."
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close."
Ross Geller,"Actually, it wasn't that close."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Why-why would I care about that?
Ross Geller,It really was.
Ross Geller,Excuse me.
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay take a guess."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!"
Ross Geller,"Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?"
Ross Geller,People are doing it in front of my book!
Ross Geller,"My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!"
Ross Geller,"Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around."
Ross Geller,"Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!"
Ross Geller,Oh for cryin' out loud!
Ross Geller,"Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?"
Ross Geller,No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
Ross Geller,"Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it."
Ross Geller,"Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!"
Ross Geller,Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?"
Ross Geller,"Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?"
Ross Geller,I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
Ross Geller,"I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller."
Ross Geller,Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
Ross Geller,"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
Ross Geller,I am very...very sorry.
Ross Geller,"Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later."
Ross Geller,Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Ross Geller,"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?"
Ross Geller,What? That's like insanely easy!
Ross Geller,What? You forgot fourteen states?
Ross Geller,"Wow, how many have you got?"
Ross Geller,Done! With time a-to-spare.
Ross Geller,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?"
Ross Geller,What? That's impossible.
Ross Geller,"No, just give me another minute."
Ross Geller,"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner."
Ross Geller,You're on!
Ross Geller,Pshhshhh!
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?"
Ross Geller,Ohio!! Thank you!
Ross Geller,What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Ross Geller,Are you out of your mind?
Ross Geller,"Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!"
Ross Geller,It's too cold.
Ross Geller,It hurts my teeth.
Ross Geller,How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Ross Geller,"Damn, I forgot you were here."
Ross Geller,Hey! What's she doing back here?
Ross Geller,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but, but look what I'm..."
Ross Geller,"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there."
Ross Geller,Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Ross Geller,"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now."
Ross Geller,Because you sent away the dog!
Ross Geller,"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed."
Ross Geller,"From you? Yes, please!"
Ross Geller,"I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving."
Ross Geller,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something."
Ross Geller,"Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?"
Ross Geller,"Ah, what good are you."
Ross Geller,Delaware! Delaware!
Ross Geller,I want my turkey now!
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,You sure?
Ross Geller,"No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours."
Ross Geller,Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,Ohh.
Ross Geller,That is so unfair!
Ross Geller,"Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so..."
Ross Geller,You like it?
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Ahh.
Ross Geller,"Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride."
Ross Geller,You're welcome.
Ross Geller,Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?"
Ross Geller,Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
Ross Geller,"Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set..."
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!"
Ross Geller,Well...In-in case of emergency.
Ross Geller,"Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, ""You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."""
Ross Geller,"Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?"
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,I swear!
Ross Geller,"Come on. All right, here we go. All right?"
Ross Geller,All right. Feel good?
Ross Geller,"All right, try pedaling."
Ross Geller,"That's it, your doing great."
Ross Geller,Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Ross Geller,Yes!! Yes!!!
Ross Geller,I-I just thought you were doing so well. I...
Ross Geller,It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
Ross Geller,"Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy."
Ross Geller,Need some help?
Ross Geller,"By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me."
Ross Geller,"Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike."
Ross Geller,"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!"
Ross Geller,Phoebe.
Ross Geller,"All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back."
Ross Geller,"Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying."
Ross Geller,Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
Ross Geller,"Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year."
Ross Geller,"Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah."
Ross Geller,Hmm.
Ross Geller,"Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?"
Ross Geller,"Well, I do, so let's... So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?"
Ross Geller,"Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?"
Ross Geller,"Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday."
Ross Geller,"Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees."
Ross Geller,"Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay."
Ross Geller,"Okay, it's not a contest."
Ross Geller,"Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?"
Ross Geller,"No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben."
Ross Geller,"No, hey-hey, come on, Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!"
Ross Geller,Yes! Santa's coming!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"No, these are my pants."
Ross Geller,"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?"
Ross Geller,"Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something."
Ross Geller,I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!
Ross Geller,Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Ross Geller,"That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents."
Ross Geller,"You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!"
Ross Geller,"You are? Me, too!"
Ross Geller,"You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?"
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ross Geller,"What are you doing here, Santa?"
Ross Geller,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
Ross Geller,What are you doing?
Ross Geller,"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave."
Ross Geller,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me."
Ross Geller,"Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!"
Ross Geller,"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay."
Ross Geller,"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees."
Ross Geller,"...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for..."
Ross Geller,"That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!"
Ross Geller,"Come on, come on, we're-we're-we're lighting the candles!"
Ross Geller,"Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?"
Ross Geller,"Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?"
Ross Geller,"Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail."
Ross Geller,"Y'know, she tried to undress me too."
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!"
Ross Geller,"Phoebe he's right, that is the rule."
Ross Geller,"Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?"
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall."
Ross Geller,"Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling."
Ross Geller,"Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!"
Ross Geller,Not broad backed!
Ross Geller,What? I can't cancel on Joan!
Ross Geller,"Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan."
Ross Geller,"Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah."
Ross Geller,"Stop saying, ""Blood"" to strangers."
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey Aunt Millie."
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!"
Ross Geller,"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her."
Ross Geller,That bitch!
Ross Geller,"Hi Frannie, congratulations."
Ross Geller,So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Ross Geller,"What? Oh, okay. Wait here."
Ross Geller,Well...
Ross Geller,Why?! Why on the lips?!
Ross Geller,"Well, technically it seven billion years ago..."
Ross Geller,"Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop! No teaching, okay? We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. Okay? Who's official name is Bapstein-King."
Ross Geller,"Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What? Is it the comet?
Ross Geller,"Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!"
Ross Geller,Show me where?
Ross Geller,Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
Ross Geller,Joey!
Ross Geller,"It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!"
Ross Geller,Rachel!! Monica!!
Ross Geller,I can't believe this!!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!"
Ross Geller,"I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!"
Ross Geller,"Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in."
Ross Geller,"Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't."
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility."
Ross Geller,"Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?"
Ross Geller,"Okay. Well, you be careful."
Ross Geller,Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
Ross Geller,"Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later."
Ross Geller,I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there...
Ross Geller,"Okay, do-do you have a good grip?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now."
Ross Geller,Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Ross Geller,I would say that.
Ross Geller,"Okay, here I go."
Ross Geller,"I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight."
Ross Geller,So what do you want me to do?
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Ross Geller,It's still looks pretty far!
Ross Geller,Do not rush me!!
Ross Geller,"Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what's weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you're gonna have to say, ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."" Not, ""My friend Ross,"" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That's weird isn't it?"
Ross Geller,"Sure, do whatever you want."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Oh, it looks like mom and dad's house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is...Oh my God!!"
Ross Geller,I can't believe they-they didn't even tell us!
Ross Geller,"Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! Yes we're surprised! Who did you leave a message with?"
Ross Geller,"I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger's gonna be living in my room."
Ross Geller,They kept your room for a while.
Ross Geller,"Come on, you know they love you."
Ross Geller,I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It's not my fault.
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,What's wrong with this year?
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Dad?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house."
Ross Geller,Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater."
Ross Geller,"Wow! Great! Wait, dad who-who's cigarettes are these?"
Ross Geller,"Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad, Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym... Oooh, my rock polisher!"
Ross Geller,It's a clown kit! Clown kit!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,How are you ever going to sell this place?
Ross Geller,"Oh no. Dad! Dad! What... Oh God...everything's ruined! Dad, she's gonna be crushed!"
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,"Dad that won't matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her."
Ross Geller,"Well, can you blame her?"
Ross Geller,"Dad, dad I don't want to hear about it."
Ross Geller,"Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we're gonna give her some! Okay, grab...grab some empty boxes. Okay? We'll-we'll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we'll-we'll put 'em in their."
Ross Geller,Like uh y'know like this! This! She-she could've made this!
Ross Geller,Right? And this! She-she could've won this!
Ross Geller,"Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?"
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Yeah! Yeah! Oh, this will make a great memory."
Ross Geller,"Well, these. These are yours right here."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book."
Ross Geller,Nu-uh!
Ross Geller,"Oh, I don't know how that got in there."
Ross Geller,"Umm, your boxes are umm..."
Ross Geller,Dad?
Ross Geller,All right. I think it was a mouse.
Ross Geller,What?!!!
Ross Geller,"Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!"
Ross Geller,"Well, what about me?! I'm a medical marvel!!"
Ross Geller,Happy birthday!!!
Ross Geller,We've got presents!
Ross Geller,Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Ross Geller,"Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?"
Ross Geller,Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Ross Geller,"How hot do I look in this, huh?!"
Ross Geller,That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Ross Geller,"I don't know, but-but look how shiny!"
Ross Geller,Hop in. Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Ross Geller,Damnit!
Ross Geller,"Okay, forward. Forward-Stop! Okay, back-Stop! Okay, forward-Stop! Stop! Stop!"
Ross Geller,No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.
Ross Geller,Maybe that will liven up this party.
Ross Geller,Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Ross Geller,Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!
Ross Geller,You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Ross Geller,I really wish that you wouldn't.
Ross Geller,Come on!
Ross Geller,"Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...and slide it out. Lift and slide!"
Ross Geller,Lift!! And slide!
Ross Geller,"All right everyone, lift! And slide!!"
Ross Geller,"God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?"
Ross Geller,Yes! My baby's finally free!
Ross Geller,Woohoo!
Ross Geller,You wanna buy a car?
Ross Geller,What's the matter? You okay?
Ross Geller,"Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys."
Ross Geller,"Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T."
Ross Geller,What? A brain transplant?!
Ross Geller,It's ridiculous!
Ross Geller,"It's winter, they are fewer people on the street."
Ross Geller,"Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the ""brain transplant,"" you are going to be her?"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,"Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots."
Ross Geller,Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more...
Ross Geller,How did you know about that?!
Ross Geller,Were you the ones called the cops?!
Ross Geller,Why not?
Ross Geller,Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
Ross Geller,"No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration."
Ross Geller,...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Ross Geller,Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Ross Geller,"Now umm, remember I'm still learning."
Ross Geller,"One, two, three, four!"
Ross Geller,You know the song! Sing along!
Ross Geller,So?
Ross Geller,You know the song! Sing along!
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency."
Ross Geller,"Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?"
Ross Geller,Okay! All clear!
Ross Geller,Everything okay in there?
Ross Geller,Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Ross Geller,"Oh, she isn't home."
Ross Geller,"Well, Ben would be there."
Ross Geller,What's the matter?
Ross Geller,"Rach, he's not an ex-con."
Ross Geller,I don't know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Ross Geller,"Okay. Ben? Come here. All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?"
Ross Geller,I wasn't talking to you.
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'll see you soon buddy. Be back in an hour."
Ross Geller,I have a bone to pick with you.
Ross Geller,Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Ross Geller,That's right! That's right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Ross Geller,Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They're mean and they're stupid and-and I don't want my son learning them!
Ross Geller,"I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?"
Ross Geller,Rachel! What are you doing here?
Ross Geller,Your good friend?
Ross Geller,What's her last name?
Ross Geller,"Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?"
Ross Geller,"Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, ""Dude, don't you ever was your face?"""
Ross Geller,Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it's not funny!
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Practical jokes.
Ross Geller,You have a line down your face.
Ross Geller,"Uh, y'know what? I'll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal's office wearing nothing but a catcher's mitt!"
Ross Geller,"I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?"
Ross Geller,"No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I..."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey I'm sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I've got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, 'Fun Aunt' Rachel, so..."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'll see you later pal."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What? That's great. That is great. What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Ross Geller,"All right, that's it! Come-you-no! You are in big trouble young man!"
Ross Geller,"Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!"
Ross Geller,I-I-am-
Ross Geller,"Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?"
Ross Geller,"Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you."
Ross Geller,"I got it. So hi, I'm uh, I'm Ross and this is my friend Chandler."
Ross Geller,"Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, 'cause if you are...I'd love to show you around sometime."
Ross Geller,Ah.
Ross Geller,"Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!"
Ross Geller,"Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?"
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Great! Uh, let me take this up for you."
Ross Geller,"Oh no-no, after you. Oh my God!"
Ross Geller,"Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again."
Ross Geller,"Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says..."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
Ross Geller,Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Ross Geller,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Ross Geller,"Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her..."
Ross Geller,"That's interesting, but check this out. I date her..."
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while."
Ross Geller,"No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best."
Ross Geller,Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...
Ross Geller,"Well sorry, that's what I do on dates."
Ross Geller,So let's decide on the spending limit...
Ross Geller,I was thinking more like a hundred.
Ross Geller,Hey! What's up?
Ross Geller,Oh thanks!
Ross Geller,We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Ross Geller,I am dressed.
Ross Geller,I have an oily T-zone!
Ross Geller,That's right.
Ross Geller,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though."
Ross Geller,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Ross Geller,Why am I not surprised?
Ross Geller,I don't think you have much choice.
Ross Geller,Bye-bye!
Ross Geller,Yes. Yes. Just here and there .
Ross Geller,So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Ross Geller,Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
Ross Geller,Yeah. So...
Ross Geller,"So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?"
Ross Geller,"That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?"
Ross Geller,Much better.
Ross Geller,"Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son."
Ross Geller,"That's right! Wait no, Ben."
Ross Geller,Well umm...
Ross Geller,"Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?"
Ross Geller,Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Ross Geller,Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Ross Geller,Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Ross Geller,Probably around gonorrhea.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!"
Ross Geller,...and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
Ross Geller,Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Ross Geller,"Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?"
Ross Geller,"Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you."
Ross Geller,Well you need 60% to pass...
Ross Geller,Seven.
Ross Geller,No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
Ross Geller,"Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem."
Ross Geller,Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Ross Geller,"Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs."
Ross Geller,Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Ross Geller,There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Ross Geller,I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Ross Geller,"Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of...sexy professor vibe?"
Ross Geller,It-it-The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Ross Geller,Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Ross Geller,"Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?"
Ross Geller,And why exactly would I do that?
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,"Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
Ross Geller,"Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?"
Ross Geller,"Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back."
Ross Geller,'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay--Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?"
Ross Geller,A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Ross Geller,Cassie?
Ross Geller,"Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes."
Ross Geller,So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
Ross Geller,What-why?
Ross Geller,What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
Ross Geller,"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now."
Ross Geller,Cassie?!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't."
Ross Geller,"It's okay. Come, come on in."
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Ross Geller,Yeah-No!!
Ross Geller,"Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog."
Ross Geller,Thank God.
Ross Geller,"Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now."
Ross Geller,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
Ross Geller,"Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be."
Ross Geller,"She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in."
Ross Geller,"Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything."
Ross Geller,"She seems really, really fun!"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,So that's two of my wives.
Ross Geller,Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
Ross Geller,"No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman's tux!"
Ross Geller,That's right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film...that Batman film he was in.
Ross Geller,So?
Ross Geller,"Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love."
Ross Geller,"Pretty please? Not very uh, 007."
Ross Geller,When I got married you slept with my sister.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Ross Geller,Gunther. Hey-hey! Why don't we put them on? Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Ross Geller,Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Ross Geller,What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!!
Ross Geller,"Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin' in there."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Let me see that! Oh man!
Ross Geller,"Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise."
Ross Geller,"Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you."
Ross Geller,"...everyone, this is Chandler!"
Ross Geller,"I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions."
Ross Geller,How's Monica coming along with her vows?
Ross Geller,I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Ross Geller,Phoebe that's not true.
Ross Geller,"Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long."
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,What?! What?!
Ross Geller,"Actually, it looks really good."
Ross Geller,No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ross Geller,It'll be okay Joe.
Ross Geller,That little naked guy would be me.
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
Ross Geller,Got me.
Ross Geller,Looks like a fun gang.
Ross Geller,"Nono, that would be me again."
Ross Geller,"Oh man, this is hilarious."
Ross Geller,Dude!
Ross Geller,Dude! How-how did you write this?
Ross Geller,You can't do that!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a little spin."
Ross Geller,It's a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Ross Geller,Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Ross Geller,Only way to fly.
Ross Geller,You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Ross Geller,Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Ross Geller,What?! Give-give me a brush.
Ross Geller,No way!
Ross Geller,"Fine! Y'know what? It doesn't matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom."
Ross Geller,What do you think you're doing?!
Ross Geller,There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don't you just hand over the keys?
Ross Geller,No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!

Ross Geller,Thanks you guys.
Ross Geller,Can I have everyone's attention please? I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller.
Ross Geller,"Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings."
Ross Geller,"Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel."

Ross Geller,"Hey, where's Chandler?"
Ross Geller,Chandler? Chandler?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Is uh, is Monica here?"
Ross Geller,I think Chandler's gone.
Ross Geller,He left that.
Ross Geller,I think it means he freaked out and left!
Ross Geller,"Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?"
Ross Geller,"I will, I will find him."

Ross Geller,"Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?"
Ross Geller,"No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!"
Ross Geller,"No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them."
Ross Geller,No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
Ross Geller,"Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night."
Ross Geller,Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Ross Geller,Give me two.
Ross Geller,"Okay, wish me luck."
Ross Geller,Why?!
Ross Geller,We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
Ross Geller,"That is an old, Chinese woman!"
Ross Geller,"Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?"
Ross Geller,So this is your office?
Ross Geller,"She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home."
Ross Geller,What's wrong with being the Bings?
Ross Geller,"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?"
Ross Geller,Then you are neither of your parents!
Ross Geller,"Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?"
Ross Geller,"There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?"
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time."
Ross Geller,"Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!"
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?"
Ross Geller,"He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek."
Ross Geller,"You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad."
Ross Geller,Oh my God! Monica!
Ross Geller,Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,These-these are beads of joy.
Ross Geller,"Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?"
Ross Geller,Chandler's gone again!
Ross Geller,There he is!!
Ross Geller,You're not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
Ross Geller,Hiiii-Ya!! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister!
Ross Geller,Then where the hell have you been?!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Ross Geller,Know what-If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
Ross Geller,Oh my God. Oh my God! And you're-you're...you're not freaking out?

Ross Geller,Monica's pregnant!
Ross Geller,What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
Ross Geller,No! I'll be right back.
Ross Geller,"Hi. I'm uh, I'm Ross. I don't, I don't believe we've met. I'm Monica's older brother."
Ross Geller,"Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name."
Ross Geller,"Aw come on, Mona Lisa?"
Ross Geller,"Mona umm...Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world."
Ross Geller,"Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too."
Ross Geller,"Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken."
Ross Geller,"Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six."
Ross Geller,"Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm... Hello."
Ross Geller,"It was the chair again! Okay? I'm not doing it! It what-look, I don't-y'know what-eh-eh... Hi."
Ross Geller,"Umm, would you like to dance?"
Ross Geller,Yeah?

Ross Geller,"Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady."
Ross Geller,"Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first."
Ross Geller,"Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don't we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet."
Ross Geller,Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking?
Ross Geller,Keep dancing.

Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?"
Ross Geller,What? Of course you can! Hop on!

Ross Geller,"That's, that's pretty. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?"
Ross Geller,Okay. Hop on Gert.
Ross Geller,I'm trying.
Ross Geller,Maybe I should stand on your feet!
Ross Geller,I just didn't see the fast song coming.
Ross Geller,"Oh, thank you."
Ross Geller,Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How...How small are your feet?!
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
Ross Geller,Thread!
Ross Geller,What disposable cameras?
Ross Geller,No you didn't.
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, ""Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"" Yeah, then you did that."
Ross Geller,No. Sorry man.
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm sure they're still somewhere here in the hotel. I'll-I'll help you look for them."
Ross Geller,In-in three minutes.
Ross Geller,Chandler?
Ross Geller,No. Did you?
Ross Geller,"Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one's turned them."
Ross Geller,"Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?"
Ross Geller,I'm sorry man. Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom. There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Ross Geller,"No-no-no, I'm saying we-we buy more of this at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else's faces."
Ross Geller,I'm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren't these the same flowers?"
Ross Geller,What about the chairs?
Ross Geller,How about the place settings?
Ross Geller,What did you do?
Ross Geller,Hmm.
Ross Geller,I heard it. I heard it.
Ross Geller,Okay. Okay!
Ross Geller,Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
Ross Geller,A '95 LeSabre?!
Ross Geller,A green LeSabre?
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre."
Ross Geller,Well go! Go move it!
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Now you are going to love these.
Ross Geller,"Huh, didn't see that coming."
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm gonna go get these in some water."
Ross Geller,"No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. Hey! My sweater! I've been looking for this for like a month!"
Ross Geller,Hey! How you doing?
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Oh hey, right back at ya."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. She-Well, she's one crazy lady?"
Ross Geller,"Umm, I don't some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later."
Ross Geller,He is so weird.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,No why?
Ross Geller,"Oh well, I guess I'll catch up with her later."
Ross Geller,Oh no.
Ross Geller,I think I might know what this is about.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together."
Ross Geller,Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Ross Geller,"Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again."
Ross Geller,Why? What-what else could it be?
Ross Geller,I'm telling you. I'm telling you. That's what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn't say anything to you?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I guess I should. Man, y'know what I have to realize? Maybe I'm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y'know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"I think we do. Why don't we go inside? Look uh, I know why you're here."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
Ross Geller,"Okay. Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?"
Ross Geller,"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and...and certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?"
Ross Geller,"Okay. Okay. Y'know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now."
Ross Geller,Oh sure.
Ross Geller,I'm good. I'm good.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I need uh... I'm just-I don't know-I don't understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom."
Ross Geller,What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Ross Geller,No they don't!!! Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Ross Geller,Oh well I may as well have!
Ross Geller,"Freaked out? Hey no, I'm not freaked out! I'm indignant! As a consumer!"
Ross Geller,"No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I-In fact, I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!"
Ross Geller,Shh! Shh! Shh!
Ross Geller,Yeah I'll press 1!
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Sure.
Ross Geller,Namaste.
Ross Geller,Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Ross Geller,"Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her."
Ross Geller,"Yeah but uh... Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else. Rachel's pregnant."
Ross Geller,With my child.
Ross Geller,You already know don't you?
Ross Geller,Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.
Ross Geller,Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Ross Geller,"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective."
Ross Geller,I gotta go find her.
Ross Geller,Evidently they do.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,Uh we-we need to talk.
Ross Geller,"Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today."
Ross Geller,What? Oh yeah. I'm sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I really-I should have been thinking about you Rach...
Ross Geller,"Right! Right! I just-I want you to know that I'm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor's appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment-Although we could probably worry about that 'til after we get married."
Ross Geller,"Well yeah, I think we should get married."
Ross Geller,"No, because that's the right thing to do."
Ross Geller,No but...but still you can't possibly do this alone.
Ross Geller,"Come on Rach, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant."
Ross Geller,"I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?"
Ross Geller,When have you ever?
Ross Geller,Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Ross Geller,I grew up with Monica! If you didn't eat fast you didn't eat!!
Ross Geller,"But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone."
Ross Geller,I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
Ross Geller,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,Pretty amazing huh?
Ross Geller,What? What?!
Ross Geller,You-you just said that you did!
Ross Geller,"Oh sure, come here! Sure you can! Uh, look come here look, it's-it's-it's, it's right there ."
Ross Geller,Do you really?
Ross Geller,"Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?"
Ross Geller,Sweetie that's it.
Ross Geller,You're welcome.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that's our baby."
Ross Geller,"Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus."
Ross Geller,Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Ross Geller,Hello!
Ross Geller,"So, how was the honeymoon?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, thanks."
Ross Geller,Umm that's...that's a little misleading.
Ross Geller,The lie you just told.
Ross Geller,There's the one!
Ross Geller,"Yes let's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who."
Ross Geller,What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Y'know what?! It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? Y'know what? Rachel, just-just drop it."
Ross Geller,"I can show you, I have it on videotape! It's an expression."
Ross Geller,Rachel won't talk to me! She won't even open the door!
Ross Geller,"Okay, listen I am not a pervert!"
Ross Geller,"Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing."
Ross Geller,About...about sex? That I hadn't had sex in months?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about."
Ross Geller,"I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise."
Ross Geller,"Five to be lying, six."
Ross Geller,"Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky."
Ross Geller,"Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!"
Ross Geller,Really? Well then tell it to me.
Ross Geller,I'll try to control myself.
Ross Geller,You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Ross Geller,"Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?"
Ross Geller,Why?
Ross Geller,"It's from France...In Europe...Western Europe. Y'know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe."
Ross Geller,"Uh-hmm-Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona."
Ross Geller,"Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking..."
Ross Geller,Oh that's great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo...
Ross Geller,Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Ross Geller,Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Ross Geller,"No! No, I don't...don't want to."
Ross Geller,I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Ross Geller,"I was just outside Barcelona, hiking..."
Ross Geller,It's been six months! I'm always hot!
Ross Geller,I'll try that.
Ross Geller,Thanks.
Ross Geller,Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Ross Geller,"Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out."
Ross Geller,Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? Rachel!
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"That's less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was."
Ross Geller,"So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. It kept rolling and recorded everything."
Ross Geller,What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Ross Geller,Thank you. No!
Ross Geller,Joey! No!
Ross Geller,"Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it! Anyway, here. I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself."
Ross Geller,"Forget it, she's destroying it."
Ross Geller,"Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It's Rachel's tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story."
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,I don't want people to see it for your sake.
Ross Geller,"Rachel, please..."
Ross Geller,"Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I'm gonna be saying..."
Ross Geller,Hello! Can I get you anything?
Ross Geller,You didn't do it?
Ross Geller,Not on the ones we sent out.
Ross Geller,"I know. Hey remember...remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost..."
Ross Geller,"I mean I...I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to."
Ross Geller,So we...we both wanted to.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best."
Ross Geller,And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
Ross Geller,Now I'm so happy.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn't matter. I mean, I think it would've happened either way. I mean if you hadn't initiated it I-I-I know I would've."
Ross Geller,It was. It was an amazing night.
Ross Geller,I uh... I don't know. I mean I...I honestly didn't watch it.
Ross Geller,Uhhhhhh...that-that may be weird.
Ross Geller,Good luck.
Ross Geller,Mind if I mute?
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh there go the clothes."
Ross Geller,"Six months Rachel, six months."
Ross Geller,Hey. We-we look...we look pretty good.
Ross Geller,Oh nice tan!
Ross Geller,Ah....
Ross Geller,I have been working out.
Ross Geller,Oh that's not pretty.
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,Oh no!
Ross Geller,Oh no!!
Ross Geller,No!!
Ross Geller,No!!!
Ross Geller,Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Ross Geller,"Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Yeah!!
Ross Geller,"I'm telling you, I like the food!"
Ross Geller,Did that guy just call you Toby?
Ross Geller,"Well, why don't you correct him?"
Ross Geller,Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Ross Geller,"Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!"
Ross Geller,"Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?"
Ross Geller,Rach? You wanna come?
Ross Geller,A date?
Ross Geller,"Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull."
Ross Geller,A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
Ross Geller,You set her up?!
Ross Geller,Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Ross Geller,"Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?"
Ross Geller,A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Ross Geller,Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
Ross Geller,Hi. I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
Ross Geller,A bit of a daredevil are we?
Ross Geller,Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Ross Geller,Yes it is too slutty!
Ross Geller,Books?
Ross Geller,"Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang."
Ross Geller,"Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no."
Ross Geller,I just...I have to find out how it went.
Ross Geller,This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
Ross Geller,I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
Ross Geller,I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
Ross Geller,"It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section."
Ross Geller,No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Ross Geller,It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
Ross Geller,No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
Ross Geller,"No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Ross Geller,Hello.
Ross Geller,"Well, how was the date?"
Ross Geller,Uh-huh. What happened?
Ross Geller,"Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?"
Ross Geller,Oh?
Ross Geller,He sounds swell.
Ross Geller,"Hey, wanna...wanna a little cheering up?"
Ross Geller,Sit down.
Ross Geller,Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Ross Geller,Yeah-ha!
Ross Geller,I'm sorry about your date.
Ross Geller,"Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea."
Ross Geller,"You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, I thought I cheered you up."
Ross Geller,Right. Good night.
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Oh hi!
Ross Geller,Wow! Uh...how are you?

Ross Geller,Great! Well umm...
Ross Geller,"Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Well, I'll-I'll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so..."
Ross Geller,Not two years in a row.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I will."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"That's right! He was hitting on her, and I got her. I guess the better man won. Please don't take her from me."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? Well, I'm a potato or a...spud. And these are my antennae. So Sputnik, becomes... Spud-nik. Spudnik!"
Ross Geller,"No, I-I'm not doody."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,You made it!
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm a spud..."
Ross Geller,Yes!
Ross Geller,That's funny. Yeah. Y'know you're the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Ross Geller,"Uh, in her defense, she's right. I am stronger. I would destroy you."
Ross Geller,Oh I'll prove it! I'll prove it like a theorem!!
Ross Geller,Oh yeah? You're going further down! Downtown!
Ross Geller,Pride.
Ross Geller,"So, you gettin' tired?"
Ross Geller,Yeah? Me too. Gettin' a little tired though.
Ross Geller,"Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona's standing right over there. Oh God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin' people up! And I'm dressed as doody."
Ross Geller,"Come on, who are we kidding? I'm doody. Please? She's watchin'."
Ross Geller,Oh yeah!
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Oh. Yeah. Uh Chandler let me win. No, Chandler's really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse!"
Ross Geller,I think it's coming from your bag.
Ross Geller,So apparently I'm available for lunch.
Ross Geller,You're moving?
Ross Geller,So does-does Joey know you're moving?
Ross Geller,That's not really porn.
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died."
Ross Geller,"Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Yeah. No. No you're right.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
Ross Geller,I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Oh, thank God!"
Ross Geller,"Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room."
Ross Geller,Y'know I would it's just painful.
Ross Geller,"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we're done."
Ross Geller,Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
Ross Geller,Really?!
Ross Geller,Sweet!
Ross Geller,Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Ross Geller,"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available."
Ross Geller,"It's not for me, it's for Rachel."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?"
Ross Geller,Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
Ross Geller,Damnit!
Ross Geller,Hi. How is she?
Ross Geller,"Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen."
Ross Geller,Oh I don't know that it would.
Ross Geller,All right then.
Ross Geller,"Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don't care, because you got the apartment. Yes!"
Ross Geller,Ezels!!
Ross Geller,Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, a lot of my students do that."
Ross Geller,"Okay, I-I'll see you tonight."
Ross Geller,"Okay, bye."
Ross Geller,"Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so..."
Ross Geller,"Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!"
Ross Geller,"Well I...I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?"
Ross Geller,"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!"
Ross Geller,"Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight."
Ross Geller,Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Ross Geller,So much more.
Ross Geller,"Aw forget it, it's from Pier One. Sorry."
Ross Geller,Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.
Ross Geller,Who did?!
Ross Geller,"Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing."
Ross Geller,"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel."
Ross Geller,"Oh but not that way. I mean...I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend."
Ross Geller,Hey! I offered to marry her!
Ross Geller,But I didn't want to.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green."
Ross Geller,"I was going to tell you, but..."
Ross Geller,Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?
Ross Geller,"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need to, I need to lie down."
Ross Geller,So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!
Ross Geller,I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
Ross Geller,Rachel!
Ross Geller,Okay!
Ross Geller,Thank you!
Ross Geller,Thank you so much for coming back over.
Ross Geller,Focus.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Trying to date this woman.
Ross Geller,Probably shouldn't touch me.
Ross Geller,Should I leave this open for you too?
Ross Geller,Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Ross Geller,"I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!"
Ross Geller,Will!
Ross Geller,Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff! Hot stuff?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you too. Man, so-so what are you up to?"
Ross Geller,Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Ross Geller,"Oh! Man I don't think I've seen you since uh, Lance Davis' graduation party."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. It would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,So how long are you in town?
Ross Geller,"Aw-oh, that's right. Are-are you gonna be okay?"
Ross Geller,"Will, high school was-was a long time ago."
Ross Geller,"No need to point, she knows who Ross is."
Ross Geller,No. No.
Ross Geller,"Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don't think he-he knew what it was."
Ross Geller,That was in high school! It's not like it was binding forever.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay? I...I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined..."
Ross Geller,...co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Ross Geller,No-no! No-no. No-no.
Ross Geller,It was no big deal. We-we...said that the rumor was...that umm...you had both...male and female reproductive parts.
Ross Geller,"Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one's not really our fault."
Ross Geller,"Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it."
Ross Geller,"Look, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn't true?!"
Ross Geller,Well look-look I'm not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,How did you know that?!!!!
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Hey! She didn't look 50!
Ross Geller,She didn't photograph well!
Ross Geller,"I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace..."
Ross Geller,Only when it was damp!! I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what? I'm back in the club!
Ross Geller,As a romancer of the elderly.
Ross Geller,The eyes...did still sparkle.
Ross Geller,Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Nope.
Ross Geller,"That's right, I love you! And-and I'm gonna play with you all the time."
Ross Geller,Bye.
Ross Geller,Yeah. Why?
Ross Geller,Yeah I know; he's in Ben's class.
Ross Geller,Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?
Ross Geller,What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Ross Geller,"Uh, I actually haven't even met him."
Ross Geller,"Well actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he'll be there."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school...
Ross Geller,"I dropped him off at Carol's. Anyway, it turns out that I'm not going to be able to get those tickets though."
Ross Geller,Well it turns out that Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
Ross Geller,"Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that Ben's moms are lesbinims."
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends."
Ross Geller,Playpen?! Ben's seven!
Ross Geller,"Look I'm sorry Pheebs, I can't do it."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Look Phoebe, I'm sorry it's just..."
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, I..."
Ross Geller,You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
Ross Geller,Well...let's just say... Rosss caaaaan!
Ross Geller,"Uh, middle balcony."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?"
Ross Geller,Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Ross Geller,"Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow."
Ross Geller,Together? Like-like to people?
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Uh sure, sure."
Ross Geller,I know. Can you believe that?
Ross Geller,"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Huh. Wow, this is great."
Ross Geller,"Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people."
Ross Geller,"A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh...I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing."
Ross Geller,"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if we're really quite there yet."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Huh.
Ross Geller,Hmm...
Ross Geller,Let's do the card!
Ross Geller,The card! I think we're there!
Ross Geller,"Really?! I mean, even with the card?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going."
Ross Geller,"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?"""
Ross Geller,"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it."
Ross Geller,Smaller than that.
Ross Geller,"Uh, bigger than that."
Ross Geller,Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Ross Geller,"Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you."
Ross Geller,"Forget it. I-I-Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?"
Ross Geller,"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us."
Ross Geller,"Aw, we-we are so... So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun."
Ross Geller,"I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is...is it's going somewhere...fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?"
Ross Geller,"Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young."
Ross Geller,But that's not enough. So... So...here's a key to my apartment.
Ross Geller,Really.
Ross Geller,"Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship."
Ross Geller,"Oh great, I live on the street."
Ross Geller,"Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all."
Ross Geller,No. That guy is.
Ross Geller,I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Ross Geller,I love you!
Ross Geller,"Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today."
Ross Geller,"Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so...."
Ross Geller,"No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didn't I get head of the department?"
Ross Geller,"...which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance. Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?"
Ross Geller,"What?! That-that's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes."
Ross Geller,Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I'm the teacher!!
Ross Geller,"Hello. I'm sorry I'm a little late. Ah--Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller. Good job today."
Ross Geller,"No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, ""Get the hell out of my way!"""
Ross Geller,"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?"
Ross Geller,"Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And...I already put it in my family newsletter."
Ross Geller,"You've seen it, the Geller Yeller."
Ross Geller,"Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just...I just can't be afraid to get a little bit...hit by cars."
Ross Geller,"Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time! Okay, why don't we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where... Where you will see...a uh...a bunch of uh...red spots. Okay, umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-"
Ross Geller,Phoebe!!
Ross Geller,"So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs..."
Ross Geller,Right.
Ross Geller,"No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy."
Ross Geller,And smart!
Ross Geller,With an aptitude for science.
Ross Geller,Really? Me too!
Ross Geller,"Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?"
Ross Geller,Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Ross Geller,"Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin."
Ross Geller,You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Ross Geller,All right.
Ross Geller,That sounds fair.
Ross Geller,Veto.
Ross Geller,"Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat."
Ross Geller,"Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?"
Ross Geller,"Fine, you go."
Ross Geller,Huh.
Ross Geller,"Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?"
Ross Geller,Veto. Stewart?
Ross Geller,Veto. Helen?
Ross Geller,"I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?"
Ross Geller,"Uh, no. No, we're not."
Ross Geller,"No, no, we want to wait, right?"
Ross Geller,"What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it. Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!"
Ross Geller,You're looking!
Ross Geller,I saw you!
Ross Geller,Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!"
Ross Geller,Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!"
Ross Geller,"I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia."
Ross Geller,Veto.
Ross Geller,"Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!"
Ross Geller,Not like this!
Ross Geller,"So, I uh... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby."
Ross Geller,That's right. The student has become the master.
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!"
Ross Geller,You really didn't know?
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Ross Geller,I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!
Ross Geller,Permission to veto.
Ross Geller,Hello?
Ross Geller,"Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?"
Ross Geller,I hope you're a better father than you're a friend!!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What?! It is?!
Ross Geller,"Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?"
Ross Geller,"My God, the baby's kicking. That's great. Although I...kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know."
Ross Geller,"Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So...Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream."
Ross Geller,Is everything okay?
Ross Geller,"Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?"
Ross Geller,"Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don't even feel them."
Ross Geller,Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
Ross Geller,No I-Mona!
Ross Geller,What? Why? What's wrong?
Ross Geller,"No really, you tell me what's up."
Ross Geller,"So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital."
Ross Geller,"Yeah but still, I mean it should've been me. I'm the dad."
Ross Geller,"Hey uh, I brought you some lunch."
Ross Geller,Well yeah!
Ross Geller,What?! What?! Rach what?!
Ross Geller,"I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles."
Ross Geller,"I-I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?"
Ross Geller,I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!
Ross Geller,"Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
Ross Geller,So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
Ross Geller,"No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea."
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,Oh Rach that's great. That's great.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'"
Ross Geller,"Uh, I'm going to take off."
Ross Geller,What is it?
Ross Geller,All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
Ross Geller,"Hey, what's behind your back?"
Ross Geller,You don't want my opinion?
Ross Geller,"Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!"
Ross Geller,The red one.
Ross Geller,"Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?"
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting."
Ross Geller,I do too! I missed you!
Ross Geller,"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!"
Ross Geller,Yeah! I know! It was. Oh... the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Huh...uh-huh.
Ross Geller,Just a second!
Ross Geller,"I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!"
Ross Geller,Ever?!
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me."
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?"
Ross Geller,"Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-"
Ross Geller,"Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!"
Ross Geller,Ayyyayyyy!
Ross Geller,I have no idea!
Ross Geller,"Uh...lately, she just likes hanging out here."
Ross Geller,I think she's lonely.
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,"No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy."
Ross Geller,"Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy."
Ross Geller,"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you."
Ross Geller,Please start drinking!
Ross Geller,Happy Valentine's Day! ...Or something to remember me by.
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, man!"
Ross Geller,Uh...Mona just dumped me.
Ross Geller,"Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?"
Ross Geller,Really?!
Ross Geller,"Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it."
Ross Geller,"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex."
Ross Geller,"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?"
Ross Geller,C'mon! Joey! What is it?
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?"
Ross Geller,She's not a Tribbiani?
Ross Geller,"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?"
Ross Geller,"Well, uh, does she like you?"
Ross Geller,Why not?
Ross Geller,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?"
Ross Geller,Okay. Um... is he a good guy?
Ross Geller,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Ross Geller,"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her."
Ross Geller,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself."
Ross Geller,"I'm going to...uh...I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home."
Ross Geller,"Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes."
Ross Geller,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?"
Ross Geller,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Ross Geller,"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her."
Ross Geller,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself."
Ross Geller,"Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?"
Ross Geller,"Um, you...you like Rachel?"
Ross Geller,Rachel?!
Ross Geller,But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Ross Geller,"It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?"
Ross Geller,Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?
Ross Geller,Y'know what? I-I gotta go.
Ross Geller,I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child."
Ross Geller,"Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin."
Ross Geller,He's not?
Ross Geller,Why?
Ross Geller,"Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?"
Ross Geller,"Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"No, I don't want to hit you."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that."
Ross Geller,Uh...yeah sure.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,What?! You're in love with her.
Ross Geller,"Umm, no."
Ross Geller,I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Ross Geller,"No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this."
Ross Geller,If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So..."
Ross Geller,So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
Ross Geller,"I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, tell me about it."
Ross Geller,"Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?"
Ross Geller,Faded salmon color.
Ross Geller,Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
Ross Geller,That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Ross Geller,"I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die."
Ross Geller,"Mona? Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?"
Ross Geller,Hello!!
Ross Geller,Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Ross Geller,"Item J437-A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I..."
Ross Geller,You do?
Ross Geller,Oh God you're right.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Sure. Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Aww that is so cool.
Ross Geller,"Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery."
Ross Geller,You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Ross Geller,"Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going."
Ross Geller,"Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee."
Ross Geller,"So uh, he seems like a nice guy."
Ross Geller,Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Ross Geller,Hi! Hey mom.
Ross Geller,"That's a good question, dad. That's a good question..."
Ross Geller,Wha-What?
Ross Geller,Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?
Ross Geller,Can you believe that?
Ross Geller,"No, us having to lie about being married."
Ross Geller,"Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan."
Ross Geller,We love marriage!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
Ross Geller,This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry...
Ross Geller,"That depends, how much did you hear?"
Ross Geller,What was wrong with Mona?
Ross Geller,Yeah baby!
Ross Geller,"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding."
Ross Geller,Would you excuse us for a second? Umm.... what are you doing?
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley."
Ross Geller,"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower..."
Ross Geller,"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?"""
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year."
Ross Geller,"No, of course, Um... Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if...if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world."
Ross Geller,"...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
Ross Geller,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
Ross Geller,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"I know, I know it was stupid."
Ross Geller,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
Ross Geller,"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night."
Ross Geller,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
Ross Geller,That's all I'm askin'.
Ross Geller,Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Ross Geller,"Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Why'd you say no?
Ross Geller,"Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know."
Ross Geller,Shhh! We're not talking.
Ross Geller,"Uh, double latte, extra foam."
Ross Geller,"Come on, it's fun!"
Ross Geller,Are you serious?!
Ross Geller,Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Ross Geller,Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Ross Geller,It tastes like feet!
Ross Geller,Are you kidding?
Ross Geller,Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, so far nothing stupid."
Ross Geller,"Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you too."
Ross Geller,"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes."
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!"
Ross Geller,Your make-up!
Ross Geller,Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
Ross Geller,I would say that.
Ross Geller,"Okay, here I go."
Ross Geller,"I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight."
Ross Geller,It really was.
Ross Geller,Hi Jill.
Ross Geller,Amazing! Amazing!
Ross Geller,Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Ross Geller,Did you just wink at me?
Ross Geller,Oh cool!
Ross Geller,Well do you want some help?
Ross Geller,Awesome!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh..."
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other."
Ross Geller,"The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question."
Ross Geller,"It's okay, I'm ready."
Ross Geller,The fear of Triscuts!
Ross Geller,"It's possible, they have really sharp edges."
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?"
Ross Geller,Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you...
Ross Geller,Hungry monkey! Haaa! I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
Ross Geller,"Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!"
Ross Geller,Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Ross Geller,I'd like to spin the wheel!
Ross Geller,Is there a hopping bonus?
Ross Geller,Ben Franklin.
Ross Geller,Queen Victoria.
Ross Geller,Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Ross Geller,Yeah!!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Ross Geller,Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Ross Geller,A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Ross Geller,"Uh, what?"
Ross Geller,"What-You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy."
Ross Geller,Hi roomie!
Ross Geller,Well we...we don't have a garage.
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us."
Ross Geller,I'm-I'm sure that's not true.
Ross Geller,"Well uh, y'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things."
Ross Geller,"Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed."
Ross Geller,Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?"
Ross Geller,Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
Ross Geller,I'm telling you.
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,You sure?
Ross Geller,All right then. Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled! How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
Ross Geller,Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Ross Geller,"That's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?"
Ross Geller,"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! I've lost sight of why we're doing this!"
Ross Geller,Hey you guys I got some bad news.
Ross Geller,"No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find."
Ross Geller,Umm...
Ross Geller,"But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, they all know."
Ross Geller,What?! What?
Ross Geller,Are ya?
Ross Geller,What are you doing up?
Ross Geller,"Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after..."
Ross Geller,It's funny you should mention diapers.
Ross Geller,"Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?"
Ross Geller,"Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. So..."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Well uh...
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,"We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please."
Ross Geller,"Oh, okay."
Ross Geller,"I chose those, I'm a paleontologist."
Ross Geller,Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Ross Geller,That's my gym.
Ross Geller,I am like Indiana Jones.
Ross Geller,"My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here?"
Ross Geller,"Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store."
Ross Geller,Oh.
Ross Geller,"Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Y'know because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M. I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex. So, I'm gonna grab my coat."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,How are you?
Ross Geller,"Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee."
Ross Geller,"What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?"
Ross Geller,I liked her.
Ross Geller,Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
Ross Geller,Why? What was wrong with her?
Ross Geller,"Okay, so what's the matter?"
Ross Geller,"Why? What, what are you jealous?"
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time."
Ross Geller,"True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby."
Ross Geller,Do you feel better?
Ross Geller,Uh Rach?
Ross Geller,Just one thing umm...
Ross Geller,We live together. You're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin' around! Like you did last night when I had to pee?"
Ross Geller,Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you...
Ross Geller,...that you actually...
Ross Geller,Rach?
Ross Geller,The bathroom?
Ross Geller,Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Ross Geller,Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Ross Geller,Now I cannot wait to see this.
Ross Geller,"Uh sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here?"
Ross Geller,"Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse. Because with seahorses it's the male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I'd be far away in the sea."
Ross Geller,Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
Ross Geller,"Rach, we gotta go."
Ross Geller,"People ask me why we're not together, I just don't know what to tell them."
Ross Geller,"Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry..."
Ross Geller,Really? You don't think that's a little inappropriate.
Ross Geller,Fine! Fine! Y'know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You're the mommy.
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,Mmm?
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,"Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you've been a little short with me lately. I'm not trying to irritate you."
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don't we not speak until then."
Ross Geller,Y'know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human and half pure evil!
Ross Geller,"Oh, you're nice to her."
Ross Geller,Do them!!
Ross Geller,You've got to be kidding me!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked."
Ross Geller,It's sex.
Ross Geller,Monica!
Ross Geller,"Monica, what is the matter with you?"
Ross Geller,"What?! While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?! You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?!"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,Can I get some of that action?
Ross Geller,"Come on, finish your enchilada."
Ross Geller,"Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha... Oh God! So...so hot! Oh my- By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye."
Ross Geller,Stop it.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I'm dying."
Ross Geller,"This is insane, I'm not gonna make love to you just so that you'll go into labor."
Ross Geller,Always a great way to get in a man's pants.
Ross Geller,I love when you talk dirty to me.
Ross Geller,"Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen."
Ross Geller,Y'know what?
Ross Geller,Forget it.
Ross Geller,I'm getting that baby out of you!
Ross Geller,"Oh, I know."
Ross Geller,"I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,We're having a baby.
Ross Geller,Not so much.
Ross Geller,All right! Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
Ross Geller,"No, but come on, we're off to a great start aren't we? I knew I'd get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!"
Ross Geller,Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
Ross Geller,"N... No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!"
Ross Geller,Okay is there...some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Ross Geller,"Okay. Okay. Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I'm Ross Geller. We-we called from the car."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,I really think they're out of rooms.
Ross Geller,"Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm... Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up?"
Ross Geller,What-what?
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! Never done this before."
Ross Geller,"Hi! Hi, I'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you."
Ross Geller,Hi Julie.
Ross Geller,This is Rachel.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Umm say, I-I opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy."
Ross Geller,"Oh, okay."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Oh. Okay, just breathe."
Ross Geller,We're not gonna do that.
Ross Geller,Uh yes! Thank you.
Ross Geller,Later.
Ross Geller,"Oh uh, I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,"Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I-I wished you'd called first."
Ross Geller,Oh good.
Ross Geller,"Okay, what's up?"
Ross Geller,"Ma, you're asking me to marry you?"
Ross Geller,"Mom no, come on! Thank you."
Ross Geller,"N-no! Okay? We've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?"
Ross Geller,"Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry..."
Ross Geller,Gimmie!
Ross Geller,...she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
Ross Geller,"Are you kidding? Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, stop it! I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby."
Ross Geller,Hey. Who's that?
Ross Geller,What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Ross Geller,"Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?"
Ross Geller,Yeah? Okay.
Ross Geller,"Umm. Umm, I'm-I'm just gonna-"
Ross Geller,"No-no, I'm...I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy."
Ross Geller,Just ignore them.
Ross Geller,What? What?
Ross Geller,Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Ross Geller,The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Ross Geller,That's it. That's it.
Ross Geller,Just three?! I'm dilated three!
Ross Geller,Actually it's more like this.
Ross Geller,Uh Rach...
Ross Geller,And yet somehow it's true!
Ross Geller,Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,Oh there you go!
Ross Geller,No-no. We...
Ross Geller,"Um uh...We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all."
Ross Geller,"Uh well umm...we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this."
Ross Geller,Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything."
Ross Geller,Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Ross Geller,Sweetie you're doing great.
Ross Geller,What? You do? You do? Oh my God!
Ross Geller,What is that?
Ross Geller,"Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads."
Ross Geller,Go!
Ross Geller,Yes you can!
Ross Geller,Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!
Ross Geller,No! Come on let's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1...2...3!
Ross Geller,Keep pushing!
Ross Geller,You have no idea how much this hurts. Keep going! Keep going!
Ross Geller,Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
Ross Geller,Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she's here.
Ross Geller,Oh she's...she's perfect.
Ross Geller,Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
Ross Geller,"Oh, come in."
Ross Geller,"The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived."
Ross Geller,"Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names."
Ross Geller,"Wow! Umm, okay uh...everyone...this...is Isabella. What?"
Ross Geller,"Umm, Delilah."
Ross Geller,"So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl."
Ross Geller,"Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be."
Ross Geller,Hey Janice!
Ross Geller,Who's this little guy?
Ross Geller,No-no. No.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...we can't let that happen again, y'know?"
Ross Geller,I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?
Ross Geller,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her."
Ross Geller,Look at Emma!
Ross Geller,"Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel."
Ross Geller,It's...it's complicated okay?
Ross Geller,"Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, exactly."
Ross Geller,Hey Joey. Hey you.
Ross Geller,"You're weird today. Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something."
Ross Geller,"Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Hey, where's uh, where's mom?"
Ross Geller,"Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you."
Ross Geller,What about Ben?
Ross Geller,"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room."
Ross Geller,Yeah right.
Ross Geller,What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Ross Geller,Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!
Ross Geller,"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?"
Ross Geller,Actually umm...
Ross Geller,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back."
Ross Geller,"Dad, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose."
Ross Geller,I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
Ross Geller,"No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted."
Ross Geller,What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!
Ross Geller,I didn't give her that ring!
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,It's mine.
Ross Geller,Yes!
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,No!!
Ross Geller,"Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again."
Ross Geller,"Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?"
Ross Geller,Well I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless uh... Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and...it does sound like something I would do.
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Listen, I um... I heard about the engagement."
Ross Geller,"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you."
Ross Geller,I don't think you do.
Ross Geller,"Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you."
Ross Geller,Joey proposed to you?
Ross Geller,"Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?"
Ross Geller,"Wait! Whoa-whoa, you...you gave her the ring?"
Ross Geller,Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Ross Geller,Then what did happen?
Ross Geller,"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!"
Ross Geller,What?!
Ross Geller,Uhh... No.
Ross Geller,"But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach."
Ross Geller,"No, you didn't!"
Ross Geller,I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!
Ross Geller,"Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,Good weird?
Ross Geller,We're so lucky.
Ross Geller,"Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and...I've been feeling."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm...then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again."
Ross Geller,"Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y'know if we...if You're wearing the ring."
Ross Geller,And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Ross Geller,When you thought Joey proposed did...did you say yes?
Ross Geller,You said you'd marry Joey?
Ross Geller,"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?"
Ross Geller,"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend."
Ross Geller,"Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!"
Ross Geller,Rachel said she'd marry you?!
Ross Geller,Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Ross Geller,In the closet.
Ross Geller,Linen closet.
Ross Geller,In the hospital.
Ross Geller,No I left the diapers at the hospital! There's some in the bag but I'll run out and get some more.
Ross Geller,Sure what kind?
Ross Geller,"Please take your time, it's an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin."
Ross Geller,Blueberry it is.
Ross Geller,"Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?"
Ross Geller,Yep.
Ross Geller,"Yep, can you believe it?"
Ross Geller,Huh? Ooh you mean like a... Huh?
Ross Geller,Ah actually we don't.
Ross Geller,What! You didn't do anything wrong?!
Ross Geller,"Okay let's put aside that you ""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you ""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel."
Ross Geller,"And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't."
Ross Geller,"Not using it right, Joe."
Ross Geller,I'm gonna go.
Ross Geller,Give me the bag.
Ross Geller,Joey!
Ross Geller,I'm not gonna hit you.
Ross Geller,No I don't.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,Give me the bag.
Ross Geller,Give me the bag.
Ross Geller,"Joey, give me the bag."
Ross Geller,Joe I'm not kidding.
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,You ducked!!
Ross Geller,"Oh my god, this really hurts!!!"
Ross Geller,What is the matter with you?!?
Ross Geller,Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Ross Geller,I broke my thumb.
Ross Geller,"You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms."
Ross Geller,"Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?"
Ross Geller,Just Ross!
Ross Geller,You know my birthday.
Ross Geller,October 18th.
Ross Geller,Actually I'm a palian... Dinosaurs is fine... the drawing is not.
Ross Geller,"Ah, Rachel I guess."
Ross Geller,Just ah... just put roommate.
Ross Geller,I don't think that we are.
Ross Geller,"Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you."
Ross Geller,Yeah that's what she said.
Ross Geller,So I don't wanna be just anybody.
Ross Geller,"You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? I'm fine."
Ross Geller,Hey there you go!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him."
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"What, Rach?"
Ross Geller,Right.
Ross Geller,"Well, that's what I'm here for. Want me to get that?"
Ross Geller,Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,Monday?!
Ross Geller,"You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!"
Ross Geller,Not you.
Ross Geller,I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Ross Geller,"Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this."
Ross Geller,"Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why..."
Ross Geller,Who the hell was that?!
Ross Geller,"Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning."
Ross Geller,Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Ross Geller,"Well, what was it?"
Ross Geller,"Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up."
Ross Geller,"Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead."
Ross Geller,"Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well."
Ross Geller,"You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!"
Ross Geller,Rachel!!!
Ross Geller,Thanks doctor.
Ross Geller,You even have to ask?! He is alive!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Ross Geller,He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Ross Geller,"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'"
Ross Geller,"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!"
Ross Geller,It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Ross Geller,"Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me."
Ross Geller,With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way."
Ross Geller,I am a single parent.
Ross Geller,"Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office."
Ross Geller,"Hmm, yeah. Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I helped you find Waldo!"
Ross Geller,"Oh good, you haven't left yet."
Ross Geller,I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
Ross Geller,Oh man.
Ross Geller,sure.
Ross Geller,people so why you all dressed up.
Ross Geller,"oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?"
Ross Geller,"you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?"
Ross Geller,"but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious."
Ross Geller,There isn't that's what I'm saying.
Ross Geller,I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
Ross Geller,"no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway."
Ross Geller,"please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times."
Ross Geller,I'm sorry I didn't catch.

Ross Geller,"I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse."
Ross Geller,"yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,Damn super cuts!
Ross Geller,"oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset."
Ross Geller,"yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off."
Ross Geller,well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.
Ross Geller,of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
Ross Geller,"yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-a-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum."
Ross Geller,WHAT THAT'S A REAL NAME!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"YAY! quick thing, I went to talk to Mike."
Ross Geller,"oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that."
Ross Geller,umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
Ross Geller,well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
Ross Geller,"well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer and he used to date Oprah."
Ross Geller,Good yeah just be honest with him.
Ross Geller,I'll get it.
Ross Geller,This is Vicrum.
Ross Geller,"So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?"
Ross Geller,"Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go."
Ross Geller,"Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift."
Ross Geller,"Alright, we'll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye. Huh, that was my mom, she's stuck in terrible traffic."
Ross Geller,"Oh, what were the other two?"
Ross Geller,"I know, it's the first time, we're leaving the baby and ... hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ... but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She's great with kids."
Ross Geller,Ya.
Ross Geller,"Hey, you only heard Monica's side of that. That little fatso was a terror."
Ross Geller,"Rachel, I know that you can. And you should."
Ross Geller,"Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don't you, why don't you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I'll meet you there."
Ross Geller,"No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red."
Ross Geller,"I'm serious. C'mon, you should go. Here. No, uh-uh, just go."
Ross Geller,"No! No, you know what? You , the baby's fine, now squam . Yeah, story walking."
Ross Geller,"Oh, holy molly are we in a pickle now."
Ross Geller,"Okay, well the ??? is not home."
Ross Geller,"Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys."
Ross Geller,"I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y...you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping."
Ross Geller,"Can't hold her own head up, but yeah jumped."
Ross Geller,"Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?"
Ross Geller,You never cooked since 1996.
Ross Geller,"Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think ... listen, listen!"
Ross Geller,"A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment."
Ross Geller,Great. So let's get going?
Ross Geller,Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Ross Geller,I'm so sorry ...
Ross Geller,And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Thanks. Oh.
Ross Geller,Y'know this ??? is incredible.
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck."
Ross Geller,"Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop."
Ross Geller,"Huh-huh, they already know it."
Ross Geller,W-oa ... Mommy!
Ross Geller,"Well, ??? think that's us?"
Ross Geller,"You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, y'guys."
Ross Geller,Thank you.
Ross Geller,"Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that."
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with."
Ross Geller,"She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years."
Ross Geller,And she's a little mannish...
Ross Geller,Are you gay?
Ross Geller,So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap."
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!"
Ross Geller,"Because, it's weird!"
Ross Geller,What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
Ross Geller,King?
Ross Geller,You gotta be at least bi...
Ross Geller,Is everything allright?
Ross Geller,"And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?"
Ross Geller,Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... These are amazing!"
Ross Geller,"This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks."
Ross Geller,Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Ross Geller,Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Ross Geller,"Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?"
Ross Geller,Lighter than air... But that's not the point.
Ross Geller,Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Ross Geller,Thank you!
Ross Geller,...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Ross Geller,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Ross Geller,Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!
Ross Geller,Yep! That's my thing...
Ross Geller,Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Ross Geller,I swear to God...!
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?"
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me."
Ross Geller,"Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this."
Ross Geller,"No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with..."
Ross Geller,Thank you!
Ross Geller,Here goes...
Ross Geller,"Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel..."
Ross Geller,I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Ross Geller,"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings."
Ross Geller,"No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue."
Ross Geller,"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you."
Ross Geller,Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Ross Geller,"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now."
Ross Geller,"I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive."
Ross Geller,"It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?"
Ross Geller,"I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?"
Ross Geller,Here come some more...
Ross Geller,"And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. Yes we were! Yes we were! Come here gorgeous. Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. Big baby butt! I like big butts. I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon... I'm a terrible father!"
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy."
Ross Geller,"I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back..."
Ross Geller,"But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles."
Ross Geller,Please don't take her away from me!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?"
Ross Geller,You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
Ross Geller,"She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Hell yeah!
Ross Geller,Shake it!
Ross Geller,Shake it!
Ross Geller,Baby got back.
Ross Geller,Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
Ross Geller,A lot of people are thankful for those.
Ross Geller,Hey Amy.
Ross Geller,That was me.
Ross Geller,"Sure, we don't live there but..."
Ross Geller,"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD."
Ross Geller,Don't say that.
Ross Geller,"Sure, you want to go upstairs?"
Ross Geller,"You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis."
Ross Geller,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job."
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Emma.
Ross Geller,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler."
Ross Geller,Woah. Woah... Woah.
Ross Geller,"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents."
Ross Geller,"No, that that is not what we're saying."
Ross Geller,Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Ross Geller,"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together."
Ross Geller,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up."
Ross Geller,"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before."
Ross Geller,Emma.
Ross Geller,"Too far, Amy. Too far."
Ross Geller,"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma."
Ross Geller,"So, so now do I get Joey?"
Ross Geller,"Wow! Wow, You look . . . uh . . . It's just, ah . . . That dress . . . uh . . ."
Ross Geller,"Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good."
Ross Geller,"Oh right, right. So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation."
Ross Geller,"I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area."
Ross Geller,"Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun."
Ross Geller,So . . . Welcome.
Ross Geller,I got bottled breast milk.
Ross Geller,"Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano."
Ross Geller,"You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college."
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?"
Ross Geller,That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about."
Ross Geller,"Maybe you should look up ""fascinating."""
Ross Geller,I don't understand what just happened here.
Ross Geller,Hey you guys.
Ross Geller,You're really not coming back?
Ross Geller,I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Ross Geller,You got me a cola drink?
Ross Geller,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
Ross Geller,"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?"
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Ross Geller,"What are you doing here, Santa?"
Ross Geller,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?"
Ross Geller,What are you doing?
Ross Geller,"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave."
Ross Geller,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it."
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
Ross Geller,"Answer faster, answer faster!"
Ross Geller,"Answer better, answer better!"
Ross Geller,Really? You're not gonna return it?
Ross Geller,"Wow, it really is!"
Ross Geller,Oh my god...
Ross Geller,"What, you, you really quit your job?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey..."
Ross Geller,"""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?"
Ross Geller,Hi guys.
Ross Geller,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Ross Geller,"I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread."
Ross Geller,"Good one, Rach."
Ross Geller,Rach we have a code brown situation.
Ross Geller,"Alright, but you have to do one sometime."
Ross Geller,"What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even..."
Ross Geller,What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
Ross Geller,Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Ross Geller,"Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will."
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Ross Geller,Good-bye.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?"
Ross Geller,I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Ross Geller,Pants off Bing!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Ross Geller,Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Ross Geller,"You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual."
Ross Geller,Hey you guys!
Ross Geller,"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey."
Ross Geller,"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ...."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it."
Ross Geller,"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ..."
Ross Geller,"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits."
Ross Geller,"What are you, a child?"
Ross Geller,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else."
Ross Geller,Whazzup??
Ross Geller,"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
Ross Geller,"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny""."
Ross Geller,"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?"
Ross Geller,"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees."
Ross Geller,"I am, yes."
Ross Geller,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Ross Geller,We have to stop them before something happens!
Ross Geller,"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
Ross Geller,Thanx.
Ross Geller,"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, come on in. Molly?"
Ross Geller,"Ok ... Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem."
Ross Geller,Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Ross Geller,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Ross Geller,OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Ross Geller,"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !"
Ross Geller,"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!"
Ross Geller,"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!"
Ross Geller,"I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand."
Ross Geller,"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner."
Ross Geller,Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Ross Geller,That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Ross Geller,I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.
Ross Geller,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar."
Ross Geller,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away."
Ross Geller,You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
Ross Geller,"You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one..."
Ross Geller,Don't you have to be at work?
Ross Geller,"Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: ""Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"""
Ross Geller,"Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace."
Ross Geller,"Right, so that's a firm ""no"". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out."
Ross Geller,This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Ross Geller,I know!
Ross Geller,"But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it."
Ross Geller,Uh-ah!
Ross Geller,. Good choice Ross.
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am."
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle."
Ross Geller,"Oh, just this woman I've been seeing."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice."
Ross Geller,"How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel."
Ross Geller,I told you about my daughter.
Ross Geller,"I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us."
Ross Geller,Are you kidding?
Ross Geller,We'll see.
Ross Geller,"I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?"
Ross Geller,"Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep..."
Ross Geller,"When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?"
Ross Geller,"Ok, Michelle, it's time to go."
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,"You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony."
Ross Geller,"Oh, really!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, really!"
Ross Geller,What about the guy from the bar?
Ross Geller,The guy you gave your number to.
Ross Geller,"Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Ross Geller,I never gave it to you.
Ross Geller,I don't know.
Ross Geller,Who am I?
Ross Geller,I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
Ross Geller,None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!
Ross Geller,"Uh, clearly."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?"
Ross Geller,"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you."
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that'll do it."
Ross Geller,"I'm, I'm okay."
Ross Geller,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce."
Ross Geller,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me..."
Ross Geller,Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Ross Geller,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?"
Ross Geller,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me."
Ross Geller,"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date."
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be."
Ross Geller,"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight."
Ross Geller,Just the crab cakes.
Ross Geller,What's - what's going on?
Ross Geller,What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Ross Geller,"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
Ross Geller,"Hey, what's wrong?"
Ross Geller,Oh. Crab cake?
Ross Geller,"Well, what happened?"
Ross Geller,Monica told me you had a blind date.
Ross Geller,"I did, too."
Ross Geller,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Ross Geller,Why does everyone keep saying that?
Ross Geller,That bad?
Ross Geller,Female body inspector? What size is that?
Ross Geller,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid."
Ross Geller,"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?"
Ross Geller,"So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
Ross Geller,"You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising."
Ross Geller,"Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet."
Ross Geller,"What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, a real pleasure."
Ross Geller,"Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!"
Ross Geller,"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!"
Ross Geller,You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.
Ross Geller,"Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-"
Ross Geller,"Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone... ... when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: ""Gimme your money, punk!"""
Ross Geller,"I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: ""Science Boy"""
Ross Geller,A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Ross Geller,"Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?"
Ross Geller,"Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene."
Ross Geller,Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
Ross Geller,"No, it wasn't."
Ross Geller,"No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old."
Ross Geller,"Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?"
Ross Geller,It's not the best!
Ross Geller,There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Ross Geller,"Hey, let's not do this!"
Ross Geller,"Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead."
Ross Geller,"Oh my god, crap from the street?"
Ross Geller,Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
Ross Geller,"You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving!"
Ross Geller,"Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe."
Ross Geller,You're welcome.
Ross Geller,"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that."
Ross Geller,I see. You didn't happen to tell.
Ross Geller,Great. Thanks!
Ross Geller,"I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys.."
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
Ross Geller,Why?
Ross Geller,Never?
Ross Geller,"wow, are you still going to move in with him?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married."
Ross Geller,"No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage."
Ross Geller,"If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
Ross Geller,"Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!"
Ross Geller,"The Divorcer, to the rescue!"
Ross Geller,Yeah I just hurt it.
Ross Geller,"Hey! What do you guys think about this. ""Ross: The Divorce-Force""."
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful."
Ross Geller,"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you."
Ross Geller,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?"
Ross Geller,I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Ross Geller,"Hey hey, can I help?"
Ross Geller,You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, let me just finish this."
Ross Geller,"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to."
Ross Geller,It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Ross Geller,"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident..."
Ross Geller,No... I already e-mailed her.
Ross Geller,"You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat."
Ross Geller,What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
Ross Geller,"Alright, let's go!"
Ross Geller,I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Ross Geller,I have sex with dinosaurs??
Ross Geller,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!"
Ross Geller,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Ross Geller,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Ross Geller,Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Ross Geller,I'm dead?
Ross Geller,Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Ross Geller,"Oh please, hit by a blimp?"
Ross Geller,"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here."
Ross Geller,"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic."
Ross Geller,"uhu uhu, check this out."
Ross Geller,"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?"
Ross Geller,What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Ross Geller,I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Ross Geller,You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Ross Geller,Exactly!!
Ross Geller,No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Ross Geller,"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man..."
Ross Geller,"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!"
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!"
Ross Geller,Who is he?
Ross Geller,"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives."
Ross Geller,I'm dead and no one cares?
Ross Geller,"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!"
Ross Geller,"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!"
Ross Geller,"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!"
Ross Geller,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Ross Geller,"No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?"
Ross Geller,No thanks!
Ross Geller,"Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart."
Ross Geller,The woman just vanished!
Ross Geller,No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Ross Geller,"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki."
Ross Geller,"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her."
Ross Geller,"They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!"
Ross Geller,They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!"
Ross Geller,Think he washed his hands?
Ross Geller,Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Ross Geller,A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
Ross Geller,"You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!"
Ross Geller,"Uh, you're not gonna win."
Ross Geller,"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that."
Ross Geller,Why would I eat my own arm?
Ross Geller,Why?
Ross Geller,"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here."
Ross Geller,"I don't know, probably just invest it."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss it all away"""
Ross Geller,"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ..."
Ross Geller,"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too."
Ross Geller,I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Ross Geller,Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.
Ross Geller,"I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!"
Ross Geller,3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Ross Geller,"Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond."
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey!!"
Ross Geller,Monica!
Ross Geller,"Go, go, go!!"
Ross Geller,Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, it's a good idea!"
Ross Geller,"Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, we have one too!!"
Ross Geller,Come on!!
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, Rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word."
Ross Geller,"Okay, what does it mean?"
Ross Geller,"I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words ."
Ross Geller,"Yes you did, gleba is a word!"
Ross Geller,"Ok, use it in a sentence."
Ross Geller,It's not a word!
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt...."
Ross Geller,She's gonna be a scientist!
Ross Geller,Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers."
Ross Geller,I guess if everybody else is... Closing credits.
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,I'd love to!
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, what happened?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance."
Ross Geller,"Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!"
Ross Geller,"Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn..."
Ross Geller,I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
Ross Geller,The big apple!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody."
Ross Geller,Check again please!
Ross Geller,Not there.
Ross Geller,She doesn't know what to say!
Ross Geller,"Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves."
Ross Geller,"Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!"
Ross Geller,"C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!"
Ross Geller,"I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?"
Ross Geller,"Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?"
Ross Geller,"Nice, put it with the others."
Ross Geller,"We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's not cool."
Ross Geller,"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through."
Ross Geller,"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend."
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!"
Ross Geller,Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Ross Geller,At least tell me where you hid it.
Ross Geller,"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god."
Ross Geller,There's something new in the bowl.
Ross Geller,"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!"
Ross Geller,It's not the same.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett..."
Ross Geller,What? How come that you don't have to go!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today."
Ross Geller,There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Ross Geller,It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Ross Geller,"These aren't suede. Charlie: Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?"
Ross Geller,"Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller."
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice."
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out."
Ross Geller,"Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute."
Ross Geller,"We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover."
Ross Geller,I don't think so.
Ross Geller,"Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". An option that many of my students use. Shall we?"
Ross Geller,"You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, damn it!"
Ross Geller,"So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's not over!"
Ross Geller,So basically all nuts?
Ross Geller,I've lost the will to live.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department."
Ross Geller,Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny..."
Ross Geller,Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."
Ross Geller,Wh-what's going on?
Ross Geller,"No, I arranged that... Joey: Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun."
Ross Geller,"Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?"
Ross Geller,You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Ross Geller,... And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Ross Geller,"Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!"
Ross Geller,"Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood""."
Ross Geller,Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Ross Geller,Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart.
Ross Geller,Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?"
Ross Geller,Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
Ross Geller,Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Ross Geller,"She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth."
Ross Geller,"Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!"
Ross Geller,"Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... ""Can we walk""? Oh, you... you like that?"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Nice to meet you.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. Joey: It's a science."
Ross Geller,"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys."
Ross Geller,"I'd lead with that. Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra ."
Ross Geller,Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Ross Geller,"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited."
Ross Geller,And sexy.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her."
Ross Geller,Stop going through my stuff ! Rachel: Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!"
Ross Geller,"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss."
Ross Geller,Why do you care so much?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!"
Ross Geller,I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,"Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I know the type."
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh, do you, do you really?"
Ross Geller,"Look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious"" means, just don't use it!"
Ross Geller,Get to the problem!
Ross Geller,Are you wearing two belts?
Ross Geller,You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Ross Geller,"You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship."
Ross Geller,Fine.
Ross Geller,"Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love."
Ross Geller,But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire."
Ross Geller,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?"
Ross Geller,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this."
Ross Geller,"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!"
Ross Geller,Wow. What does that mean?
Ross Geller,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ross Geller,"Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings."
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,"Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!"
Ross Geller,"Respectfully, professor R. Geller. , closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, how was the Met?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?"
Ross Geller,What do you mean?
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?"
Ross Geller,"Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else."
Ross Geller,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
Ross Geller,That was going to be my next argument.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Glad I could help man.
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys!"
Ross Geller,Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing?"
Ross Geller,"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him."
Ross Geller,Tsz... NO! .
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me."
Ross Geller,It's in Barbados.
Ross Geller,So-so what did the doctor say?
Ross Geller,How do you feel about all this?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Ross Geller,The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Ross Geller,"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's not what you want..."
Ross Geller,"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?"
Ross Geller,I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Ross Geller,"It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!"
Ross Geller,Barbados.
Ross Geller,What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Ross Geller,"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!"
Ross Geller,Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?"
Ross Geller,Can you say Barbados?
Ross Geller,"Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars."
Ross Geller,"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!"
Ross Geller,"Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow."
Ross Geller,"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!"
Ross Geller,Look at all these paleontologists!!
Ross Geller,"Wow! This is very flattering, uh..."
Ross Geller,"Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... ""Dear..."""
Ross Geller,"""... Sarah. I dig you"", Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller""."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani."
Ross Geller,"Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!"
Ross Geller,Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Ross Geller,Ready to go?
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"I'm good, I have dinner plans ."
Ross Geller,"Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?"
Ross Geller,"By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century."
Ross Geller,"Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. ."
Ross Geller,The chocolates aren't here yet.
Ross Geller,"If you want to check your email, just ask!"
Ross Geller,Wha... what do you mean?
Ross Geller,"What, oh my God. What did you do?"
Ross Geller,"Why, why would you open it?"
Ross Geller,What did it say?
Ross Geller,"What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!"
Ross Geller,NO! I don't!!
Ross Geller,Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!"
Ross Geller,Get out!
Ross Geller,"Well, what do you do?"
Ross Geller,I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Ross Geller,"I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!"
Ross Geller,Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Ross Geller,"Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that's it?"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, we did it!"
Ross Geller,"Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. That's a pretty necklace."
Ross Geller,"Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, I love you."
Ross Geller,"That's Ben, my son from my first marriage."
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay."
Ross Geller,"Ok, odd thing to get excited about!"
Ross Geller,Hey! High-five!
Ross Geller,My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Ross Geller,"I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: ""Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"""
Ross Geller,"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?"
Ross Geller,Me neither.
Ross Geller,"Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much."
Ross Geller,Good night.
Ross Geller,"Walls are pretty thin, guys!"
Ross Geller,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Ross Geller,"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus..."
Ross Geller,"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development."
Ross Geller,"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus..."
Ross Geller,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Ross Geller,... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks guys!"
Ross Geller,Oh!
Ross Geller,Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
Ross Geller,"Oh, thank you so much!"
Ross Geller,"Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!"
Ross Geller,Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Ross Geller,Hey! Well...?
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?"
Ross Geller,"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!"
Ross Geller,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Ross Geller,"Look, I took it too far!"
Ross Geller,"Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man."
Ross Geller,Get Out!
Ross Geller,"Yes, please! So, what's going on?"
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, wh-what happened?"
Ross Geller,I knew that was him!
Ross Geller,"Hey, you ok?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here."
Ross Geller,"Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. . GO, GO, GO!"
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,"Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest."
Ross Geller,I don't think they saw us.
Ross Geller,Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Ross Geller,"I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so..."
Ross Geller,I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Ross Geller,"I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!"
Ross Geller,... finally...
Ross Geller,"God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that."
Ross Geller,Weh...*sigh*
Ross Geller,"Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this..."
Ross Geller,"No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it."
Ross Geller,"Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later."
Ross Geller,"Hey, what are you guys doing?"
Ross Geller,"Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?"
Ross Geller,"Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?"
Ross Geller,Thanks! Thank you!
Ross Geller,"Rach, you there?"
Ross Geller,Rach?
Ross Geller,Is everything okay?
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,You know where Joey is?
Ross Geller,Can I talk to you for a minute?
Ross Geller,"And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me."
Ross Geller,And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Ross Geller,"Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?"
Ross Geller,"You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace."
Ross Geller,Seriously... What is it?
Ross Geller,What's wrong?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,You guys ready to go?
Ross Geller,Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Ross Geller,Learn about Jesus...
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane."
Ross Geller,Stop it!
Ross Geller,You're filthy!
Ross Geller,"Uh, actually I think she went to the salon."
Ross Geller,Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Ross Geller,"You've never said that in your life, have you?"
Ross Geller,I thought so.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie."
Ross Geller,"No, I'll do it."
Ross Geller,"Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free""."
Ross Geller,Hey Rach...
Ross Geller,Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie."
Ross Geller,"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well..."
Ross Geller,Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Are you serious?
Ross Geller,"I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?"
Ross Geller,"No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous..."
Ross Geller,"You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff..."
Ross Geller,"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you..."
Ross Geller,Thanks!
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy."
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm so excited about this."
Ross Geller,Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Ross Geller,"Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?"
Ross Geller,"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie."
Ross Geller,"Okay, shoot!"
Ross Geller,OH NO!
Ross Geller,"Oh, major shampoo explosion!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?"
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?"
Ross Geller,"Duh, you think?"
Ross Geller,So you two are..?
Ross Geller,And have you .. ed?
Ross Geller,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?"
Ross Geller,I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!"
Ross Geller,"Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this."
Ross Geller,"It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?"
Ross Geller,"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!"
Ross Geller,"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!"
Ross Geller,"I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in."
Ross Geller,Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
Ross Geller,"Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!"
Ross Geller,What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
Ross Geller,You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Ross Geller,"The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood."
Ross Geller,"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'."
Ross Geller,"I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension."
Ross Geller,"We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?"
Ross Geller,My fajitas!!
Ross Geller,"Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!"
Ross Geller,That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Ross Geller,Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
Ross Geller,"And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?"
Ross Geller,"O is for ""oh, wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own."
Ross Geller,Totally.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan."
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone."
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good."
Ross Geller,I don't even know what that's for.
Ross Geller,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Ross Geller,So you took off my pants and shoes?
Ross Geller,What do you mean?
Ross Geller,"Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!"
Ross Geller,"Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?"
Ross Geller,"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?"
Ross Geller,Joey.
Ross Geller,And she feels the same way?
Ross Geller,"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on."
Ross Geller,"No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm sure."
Ross Geller,WOW!
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?"
Ross Geller,"Eh, you got a spray-on tan?"
Ross Geller,"Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?"
Ross Geller,"Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!"
Ross Geller,"So, do you get colours or just French tips?"
Ross Geller,"Thanks. Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... florist."
Ross Geller,"Well... I like how you look, what are you?"
Ross Geller,"Two, I think a two."
Ross Geller,"Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat."
Ross Geller,"Well, I have a PhD, so..."
Ross Geller,"One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!"
Ross Geller,You sprayed my front twice!
Ross Geller,"No, I barely even got to three Mississippi."
Ross Geller,"Mississippilesly? Well, how bad is it?"
Ross Geller,"So, how dark is it gonna get?"
Ross Geller,I'm a four?
Ross Geller,Really!
Ross Geller,Ok!
Ross Geller,"Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? Ah, oh, ah! Ah! The same thing happened again!"
Ross Geller,I'm an eight!
Ross Geller,I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Ross Geller,Oh! And it gets worse!
Ross Geller,How do you count to five?
Ross Geller,Damnit!
Ross Geller,I Know!
Ross Geller,"I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back."
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?"
Ross Geller,Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Ross Geller,OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Ross Geller,Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Ross Geller,Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Ross Geller,"Dude, you're not tanned."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,"C'mon you guys, this is really important to us."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister."
Ross Geller,Hey guys!
Ross Geller,"Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video."
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?"
Ross Geller,"Ah, and where is Joey?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, there is uncle Joey!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!"
Ross Geller,"Joey, NO!"
Ross Geller,When they see this you'll be 52!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,There's something you didn't know about your dad!
Ross Geller,"Oh, great!"
Ross Geller,Thank you so much for that gift!
Ross Geller,Amazing... amazing.
Ross Geller,"Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!"
Ross Geller,Sure.
Ross Geller,"Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?"
Ross Geller,I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Ross Geller,"Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!"
Ross Geller,"Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake."
Ross Geller,"Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!"
Ross Geller,"You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?"
Ross Geller,"Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there."
Ross Geller,"No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her."
Ross Geller,"No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?"
Ross Geller,"Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!"
Ross Geller,RACHEL!
Ross Geller,I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else."
Ross Geller,"Rach, she's not going to remember this."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,It's not bad.
Ross Geller,"Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears."
Ross Geller,"Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures."
Ross Geller,"Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs."
Ross Geller,"Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means..."
Ross Geller,Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Ross Geller,"Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma."
Ross Geller,What's wrong? Are you okay?
Ross Geller,"Okay, you ready?"
Ross Geller,A-a-and... record.
Ross Geller,Hey...
Ross Geller,Oh... Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Ross Geller,"B, B, B, B, B!"
Ross Geller,"Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt."
Ross Geller,Damnit!
Ross Geller,Hi Amy!
Ross Geller,Still sharp as a tack!
Ross Geller,Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Ross Geller,"Yes, yes, you did."
Ross Geller,Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
Ross Geller,Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Ross Geller,What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,What... what you working on?
Ross Geller,Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Ross Geller,"Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest."
Ross Geller,Seriously?
Ross Geller,"Well, do you wanna marry him?"
Ross Geller,Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Ross Geller,"No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?"
Ross Geller,I don't think that's what this is.
Ross Geller,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?"
Ross Geller,"Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child."
Ross Geller,"Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!"
Ross Geller,"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella."
Ross Geller,"Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby."
Ross Geller,I... I don't know..
Ross Geller,Hey guys.
Ross Geller,"Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. ."
Ross Geller,Why not?
Ross Geller,Come here Oh! There she is! Hi!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Hi! What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Ross Geller,Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
Ross Geller,That's not a thing!
Ross Geller,"Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna..."
Ross Geller,No more falafel for you!
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, what's wrong?"
Ross Geller,"So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or did he cry? Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!"
Ross Geller,"Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the ""Paleontology Review""! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!"
Ross Geller,Yeah. Why?
Ross Geller,Your ex-boyfriend?
Ross Geller,"So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!"
Ross Geller,"Well, if you think it would help."
Ross Geller,"Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?"
Ross Geller,We'll see how dinner goes.
Ross Geller,I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
Ross Geller,"Well, I... I am having a good hair day."
Ross Geller,I'm ok.
Ross Geller,"It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field."
Ross Geller,"No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm."
Ross Geller,"Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert."
Ross Geller,"See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Did you just say ""break up with Charlie""?"
Ross Geller,"Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?"
Ross Geller,Are you serious?
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,I guess!
Ross Geller,What? I... I...
Ross Geller,May 12th?
Ross Geller,Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Ross Geller,"Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology."
Ross Geller,"um... I've never heard of a ""Boscodictiasaur""."
Ross Geller,Ok. B - O - S ...
Ross Geller,Oh come on!!
Ross Geller,"Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Aunt Margaret's pants size?"
Ross Geller,No! Stop!
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,I have to break up with Charlie?
Ross Geller,You're crazy.
Ross Geller,Crazy!
Ross Geller,Get out!
Ross Geller,Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Ross Geller,"No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up."
Ross Geller,"Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""Underdog""?"
Ross Geller,"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?"
Ross Geller,Damnit!
Ross Geller,"I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth."
Ross Geller,"Too little, too late, Benji!"
Ross Geller,No!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,or...
Ross Geller,"Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable."
Ross Geller,"Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!"
Ross Geller,Hey you guys!
Ross Geller,"Hey, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,Yeah!
Ross Geller,"There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that."
Ross Geller,"I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!"
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh, good!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there."
Ross Geller,There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
Ross Geller,"Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!"
Ross Geller,Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Ross Geller,Be-caaauuuse...
Ross Geller,Seriously?
Ross Geller,And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Ross Geller,"Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!"
Ross Geller,"Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it."
Ross Geller,"Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!"
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,"Rach, she's got like three hairs!"
Ross Geller,I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Ross Geller,Ready sweety?
Ross Geller,Here we go!
Ross Geller,"See, I told you!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, absolutely!"
Ross Geller,"Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!"
Ross Geller,SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
Ross Geller,"No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice."
Ross Geller,"No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of."
Ross Geller,"Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears."
Ross Geller,Good.
Ross Geller,WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
Ross Geller,I know.
Ross Geller,Ok...
Ross Geller,"This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!"
Ross Geller,See?
Ross Geller,"There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore."
Ross Geller,Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Ross Geller,Are you kidding?
Ross Geller,That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Ross Geller,She's putting words in your mouth!
Ross Geller,"Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!"
Ross Geller,"Dude, I wanted him to guess."
Ross Geller,Guess where they are?
Ross Geller,Did I do something to you?
Ross Geller,So?
Ross Geller,"He's right, man."
Ross Geller,"We're still going at the game, right?"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,"Oh! What a game, huh?"
Ross Geller,I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away."
Ross Geller,"I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal."
Ross Geller,One more fight!
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,Forty-five minutes.
Ross Geller,Here!
Ross Geller,You may want to lose the foam finger!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,We're late too!
Ross Geller,"So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!"
Ross Geller,You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Ross Geller,"Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division."
Ross Geller,You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Ross Geller,"I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!"
Ross Geller,So this is an annual thing?
Ross Geller,Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Ross Geller,"Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!"
Ross Geller,HEY!
Ross Geller,I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Ross Geller,That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
Ross Geller,We know you're out there.
Ross Geller,"Well, let's just go in there and face them."
Ross Geller,What is that?
Ross Geller,"Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: ""Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy""."
Ross Geller,"Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down."
Ross Geller,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
Ross Geller,How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Ross Geller,That's worse than no food.
Ross Geller,I don't know...
Ross Geller,"Yeah, he can do it!"
Ross Geller,I feel terrible.
Ross Geller,So bad.
Ross Geller,"Really girls, not cool."
Ross Geller,It's a day to be thankful.
Ross Geller,Yeah! Let's go out.
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,I gave them to Joey.
Ross Geller,I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Ross Geller,Nice!
Ross Geller,I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Come on, she's gonna love you guys!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice."
Ross Geller,How does this look?
Ross Geller,C'mon! This looks good!
Ross Geller,Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Ross Geller,"Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress."
Ross Geller,You're wearing the same shirt.
Ross Geller,"You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!"
Ross Geller,"Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it! ."
Ross Geller,"Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?"
Ross Geller,"Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe : Hey, check this out! It's totally you!"
Ross Geller,Wow!
Ross Geller,Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
Ross Geller,"All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here."
Ross Geller,"Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me."
Ross Geller,Really?
Ross Geller,"So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?"
Ross Geller,So? What do you think?
Ross Geller,Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Ross Geller,"Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?"
Ross Geller,"You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!"
Ross Geller,"Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this."
Ross Geller,Here So this was fun!
Ross Geller,Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Ross Geller,"Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?"
Ross Geller,"Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?"
Ross Geller,Food.
Ross Geller,Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Ross Geller,I just can't see Chandler cheating!
Ross Geller,"I know, and with the baby coming?"
Ross Geller,"I don't know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?"
Ross Geller,"No one, I'm just saying if..."
Ross Geller,"I know nothing! Mike's a great guy, it was hypothetical!"
Ross Geller,"Believe me, if I did see with someone, there's no way I..."
Ross Geller,We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Ross Geller,What's going on?
Ross Geller,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Ross Geller,"You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay."
Ross Geller,"It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,You put an offer on a house?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?"
Ross Geller,You can see where he'd have trouble.
Ross Geller,"That money is mine, Green!"
Ross Geller,What was Monica's nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Ross Geller,Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie...
Ross Geller,Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Ross Geller,Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Ross Geller,Two seconds...
Ross Geller,"11, unbelievable, 11 is correct."
Ross Geller,Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast?
Ross Geller,"No, 19."
Ross Geller,Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Ross Geller,"Correct, his profession was?"
Ross Geller,Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job?
Ross Geller,"10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game."
Ross Geller,Don't blame the questions!
Ross Geller,"Chandler!!! Chandler!!! Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!"
Ross Geller,What the hell are doing?!!
Ross Geller,"I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!"
Ross Geller,My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.
Ross Geller,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
Ross Geller,"You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good."
Ross Geller,Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Ross Geller,Love you guys.
Ross Geller,I love this.
Ross Geller,"Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?"
Ross Geller,Really? Which one?
Ross Geller,"Things you find in the ocean, You're gonna be on ""Pyramid""!!"
Ross Geller,"Except for ""Match game""..."
Ross Geller,"Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond."
Ross Geller,Yeah-uh!
Ross Geller,"""...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll""!"
Ross Geller,"So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric."
Ross Geller,He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Ross Geller,"Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her."
Ross Geller,Dude. You're married to my sister.
Ross Geller,"Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?"
Ross Geller,Yes please.
Ross Geller,"Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!"
Ross Geller,"Thanks to a little something called ""Helvetica Bold 24 point""!"
Ross Geller,"Hey, Missy..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called ""Way! No Way!""."
Ross Geller,Boss!
Ross Geller,She's gone.
Ross Geller,"Dude, I was gonna ask her out."
Ross Geller,"Well, I thought it first, Holmes."
Ross Geller,"Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want."
Ross Geller,Me too. I'm good at it.
Ross Geller,You got it.
Ross Geller,Those are the pacts!
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh... maybe not you!"
Ross Geller,"Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?"
Ross Geller,"I know, and I can't stop sweating."
Ross Geller,"So, Saturday night!"
Ross Geller,Great!
Ross Geller,"Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?"
Ross Geller,It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Ross Geller,"That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!"
Ross Geller,"Yeah, why?"
Ross Geller,You did?
Ross Geller,AND ON MY TURF?
Ross Geller,"You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?"
Ross Geller,You broke the pact!
Ross Geller,That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Ross Geller,I didn't.
Ross Geller,No.
Ross Geller,NO!
Ross Geller,I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Ross Geller,I don't know what... you're talking about.
Ross Geller,"Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this."
Ross Geller,Cool!
Ross Geller,I didn't know you knew about that.
Ross Geller,Man... I... I'm sorry.
Ross Geller,"So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even."
Ross Geller,"We are even, right?"
Ross Geller,What did you do to my mom?
Ross Geller,"Hey, where's Rachel?"
Ross Geller,Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Ross Geller,Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Ross Geller,"Well, it matters to me."
Ross Geller,Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Ross Geller,"Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first."
Ross Geller,Mine.
Ross Geller,"No, she was definitely on my bed."
Ross Geller,"Well, then who was on my bed?"
Ross Geller,"NO! No, no!"
Ross Geller,You were under the pile of coats?
Ross Geller,OH MY GOD!
Ross Geller,You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Ross Geller,Hi!
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake."
Ross Geller,That is why!
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?"
Ross Geller,I wanna say it's not looking good.
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,"Oh, man!"
Ross Geller,FOOTBALL!
Ross Geller,I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Ross Geller,And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Ross Geller,"Who cares, AND?"
Ross Geller,I'll do it!
Ross Geller,"No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?"
Ross Geller,"Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman."
Ross Geller,"Please, you're going down!"
Ross Geller,Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Ross Geller,"So, what did you decide?"
Ross Geller,I'll do it!
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,Where's Rach?
Ross Geller,"I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!"
Ross Geller,"You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?"
Ross Geller,I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Ross Geller,"Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!"
Ross Geller,"YES, YES!"
Ross Geller,Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Ross Geller,"Well, you have fun tonight."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I will."
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?"
Ross Geller,I'm not supposed to tell you!
Ross Geller,"Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again."
Ross Geller,What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Ross Geller,Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.
Ross Geller,I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Ross Geller,"No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?"
Ross Geller,"Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!"
Ross Geller,"Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free."
Ross Geller,I'll...
Ross Geller,It's the dog.
Ross Geller,Uh Joey...
Ross Geller,Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Ross Geller,"Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this."
Ross Geller,"Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume."
Ross Geller,It was ok...
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,You guys know where Rachel is?
Ross Geller,So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Ross Geller,"So, why is Erica coming to visit?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?"
Ross Geller,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,Is-is he ok?
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now."
Ross Geller,"Still-still, let me come... for me."
Ross Geller,I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Ross Geller,Oh!
Ross Geller,And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Ross Geller,"Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him."
Ross Geller,"I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!"
Ross Geller,I'm feeling better.
Ross Geller,"He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!"
Ross Geller,Did the TV wake you?
Ross Geller,Ouchy.
Ross Geller,"Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?"
Ross Geller,"Right, is it painful?"
Ross Geller,"Nope, just the one. RACH!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great."
Ross Geller,Wow.
Ross Geller,Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room."
Ross Geller,Sorry. . You ok?
Ross Geller,"You had a rough day, uh?"
Ross Geller,"But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!"
Ross Geller,"What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look..."
Ross Geller,"They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?"
Ross Geller,"No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest."
Ross Geller,Good night.
Ross Geller,Sure!
Ross Geller,"Oh, of course..."
Ross Geller,Me too. Come here.
Ross Geller,"Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea."
Ross Geller,"No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you."
Ross Geller,"Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!"
Ross Geller,I'll see you in the morning .
Ross Geller,"Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!"
Ross Geller,"Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?"
Ross Geller,You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Ross Geller,You sure you're alright?
Ross Geller,"O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast."
Ross Geller,There it is...
Ross Geller,"Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing."
Ross Geller,Well...
Ross Geller,I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Ross Geller,"Hey, I was looking out for you."
Ross Geller,"I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever."
Ross Geller,"Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again."
Ross Geller,"That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?"
Ross Geller,Emma's down for the night.
Ross Geller,So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Ross Geller,"Oh, no problem."
Ross Geller,Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Ross Geller,"Yeah... Yeah, that's true."
Ross Geller,"Oh, ye-ah!"
Ross Geller,...Valentine's day...
Ross Geller,Hmmm-mmmm.
Ross Geller,Not even once.
Ross Geller,Even if we want it really bad.
Ross Geller,"Uhm, right!"
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,...I hate waste.
Ross Geller,Yes?
Ross Geller,Damn it. It's never off the table.
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys... I have great news."
Ross Geller,"Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today..."
Ross Geller,"Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good."
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid."
Ross Geller,"No, no. I-I'm good."
Ross Geller,I'm up for tenure.
Ross Geller,You too! What are the odds?
Ross Geller,"Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?"
Ross Geller,I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Ross Geller,"This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!"
Ross Geller,"Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow."
Ross Geller,"I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?"
Ross Geller,"Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it."
Ross Geller,And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
Ross Geller,But also knowing it means a lot.
Ross Geller,...that center around work.
Ross Geller,You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Ross Geller,"No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me."
Ross Geller,"Rach, I'm so sorry."
Ross Geller,Great. I feel like an idiot.
Ross Geller,Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!"
Ross Geller,"Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so..."
Ross Geller,"Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!"
Ross Geller,See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Ross Geller,That is Mark?
Ross Geller,I hate that guy.
Ross Geller,"No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him."
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary."
Ross Geller,"I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, is Rachel here?"
Ross Geller,She's still at dinner?
Ross Geller,That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Ross Geller,We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Ross Geller,"Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?"
Ross Geller,Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Ross Geller,Should we send something?
Ross Geller,Congratulations!
Ross Geller,"Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest."
Ross Geller,You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Ross Geller,So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"All right, we'll work it out."
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?"
Ross Geller,"Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?"
Ross Geller,"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?"
Ross Geller,I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
Ross Geller,I didn't say we were brothers.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago."
Ross Geller,Close. Ron.
Ross Geller,"Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back."
Ross Geller,"Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back."
Ross Geller,"Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?"
Ross Geller,"Huh, I took a shot there."
Ross Geller,I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
Ross Geller,"Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?"
Ross Geller,"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!"
Ross Geller,"You let Rachel come back, and it's done."
Ross Geller,"Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life."
Ross Geller,He'll be fine.
Ross Geller,Hi.
Ross Geller,Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
Ross Geller,Ok.
Ross Geller,Nooo!
Ross Geller,"So, you're not going to Paris."
Ross Geller,Wh... wh...what?
Ross Geller,Yeeeah!
Ross Geller,"It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back."
Ross Geller,Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
Ross Geller,Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
Ross Geller,Huh? So? We have a deal?
Ross Geller,Yes! yes!
Ross Geller,"Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!"
Ross Geller,"Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much."
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,They did?
Ross Geller,"So, what are you gonna do?"
Ross Geller,That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Ross Geller,"You're excited, right?"
Ross Geller,Right!
Ross Geller,"Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared."
Ross Geller,You should go.
Ross Geller,It's what you want. You should go.
Ross Geller,I really do.
Ross Geller,I'm sure he'll understand.
Ross Geller,Yeah...
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah, oh!"
Ross Geller,Then I'm happy too.
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"Hey Erica, welcome back to town! Wow, look how big you've gotten."
Ross Geller,"Right, no, I understand."
Ross Geller,"No, no, I knew ."
Ross Geller,She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Ross Geller,Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Ross Geller,"Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product..."
Ross Geller,"Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place."
Ross Geller,"No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie."
Ross Geller,"Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy."
Ross Geller,What are you guys doing?
Ross Geller,"You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!"
Ross Geller,"Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out."
Ross Geller,"Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard."
Ross Geller,"Yeah? Yeah, where is it?"
Ross Geller,"Rock on! Phoebe : Wow, this is quite a spread! What is all this stuff?"
Ross Geller,"Hey, where's Rach?"
Ross Geller,Great.
Ross Geller,Here she is!
Ross Geller,"Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?"
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?"
Ross Geller,Hey. What was that all about?
Ross Geller,Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Ross Geller,"Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations."
Ross Geller,"Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing."
Ross Geller,Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
Ross Geller,I don't think so.
Ross Geller,God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?
Ross Geller,"Okay, here we go..."
Ross Geller,Yeah...
Ross Geller,Huh?
Ross Geller,What? I don't get a goodbye?
Ross Geller,Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Ross Geller,"Well, it needs to be plicit."
Ross Geller,"No, I don't think so."
Ross Geller,"O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!"
Ross Geller,THE HELL I DO!
Ross Geller,I don't get a goodbye?
Ross Geller,"Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things."
Ross Geller,"Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris."
Ross Geller,That's what it seemed like.
Ross Geller,"Fine, then why didn't you say something?"
Ross Geller,Rach!
Ross Geller,"You keep, you keep... You can't..."
Ross Geller,Rach!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Oh. This was amazing.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a joke."
Ross Geller,Who's laughing now?
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl."
Ross Geller,Is Rachel here?
Ross Geller,"Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!"
Ross Geller,"I know, it's pretty great."
Ross Geller,"Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk."
Ross Geller,"I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together."
Ross Geller,Shhh!
Ross Geller,"Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not."
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,Hey. How did you sleep?
Ross Geller,Good.
Ross Geller,Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Ross Geller,So...
Ross Geller,Morning.
Ross Geller,It really was.
Ross Geller,"I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be."
Ross Geller,And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Ross Geller,Nothing! What do you say to that?
Ross Geller,No way!
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,You really think so?
Ross Geller,Okay.
Ross Geller,"Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel."
Ross Geller,What? What?
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,I'm not getting you a muffin!
Ross Geller,Hey.
Ross Geller,"No, and I'm not going to."
Ross Geller,Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is."
Ross Geller,"Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time."
Ross Geller,Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?"
Ross Geller,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,"Aw, he's gonna be so happy."
Ross Geller,Neither will I.
Ross Geller,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Yeah?
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her."
Ross Geller,I don't! I wanna be with her.
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I'm gonna go after her."
Ross Geller,My coat...
Ross Geller,"I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!"
Ross Geller,"Okay, guys, wish me luck."
Ross Geller,There's no seatbelt!
Ross Geller,"Alright, alright, let's do this!"
Ross Geller,Hey!
Ross Geller,"No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab."
Ross Geller,Get out of the cab!
Ross Geller,Are we off the bridge?
Ross Geller,Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Ross Geller,"Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!"
Ross Geller,"Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!"
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,Okay!
Ross Geller,"To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?"
Ross Geller,Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Ross Geller,What? We're never gonna make it!
Ross Geller,"Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great."
Ross Geller,"Hey, I need a ticket."
Ross Geller,"Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets."
Ross Geller,I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
Ross Geller,"Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?"
Ross Geller,"No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes."
Ross Geller,"What? Hey, hey, listen.."
Ross Geller,"Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?"
Ross Geller,"That's alright. Listen, listen."
Ross Geller,"Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?"
Ross Geller,That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Ross Geller,"Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board."
Ross Geller,What?
Ross Geller,JFK.
Ross Geller,"Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!"
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time."
Ross Geller,I am not doing this over the phone.
Ross Geller,Yay.
Ross Geller,Where is she?
Ross Geller,Rachel! Rachel Green!
Ross Geller,Rachel! Rachel!
Ross Geller,"No, no, I just have to talk to someone."
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, but..."
Ross Geller,"Okay, the thing is.."
Ross Geller,Don't go.
Ross Geller,"Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go."
Ross Geller,"I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane."
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do."
Ross Geller,"No, you don't."
Ross Geller,"No, you don't."
Ross Geller,Rachel?
Ross Geller,I really thought she'd stay.
Ross Geller,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,Let her off the plane!
Ross Geller,Try to understand!
Ross Geller,No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
Ross Geller,You got off the plane.
Ross Geller,"I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again."
Ross Geller,"Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid."
Ross Geller,This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Ross Geller,Don't make jokes now.
Ross Geller,Wow.
Ross Geller,"Uh, I haven't."
Ross Geller,Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
