speaker,transcript
Chandler Bing,"All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
Chandler Bing,Sounds like a date to me.
Chandler Bing,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
Chandler Bing,"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
Chandler Bing,That's right.
Chandler Bing,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me."
Chandler Bing,"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
Chandler Bing,Cookie?
Chandler Bing,Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
Chandler Bing,And I just want a million dollars!
Chandler Bing,Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
Chandler Bing,Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Chandler Bing,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and we're very excited about it."
Chandler Bing,It's a beautiful thing.
Chandler Bing,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Chandler Bing,I have no idea.
Chandler Bing,All finished!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, God."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,You must stop!
Chandler Bing,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!"
Chandler Bing,Stay out of my freezer!
Chandler Bing,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
Chandler Bing,That is amazing.
Chandler Bing,"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
Chandler Bing,"Hi, Paul, is it?"
Chandler Bing,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
Chandler Bing,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
Chandler Bing,"You're right, I'm sorry. ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."""
Chandler Bing,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, how well you know me..."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream."
Chandler Bing,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
Chandler Bing,"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
Chandler Bing,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
Chandler Bing,"Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!"
Chandler Bing,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Chandler Bing,Oh! Yeah!
Chandler Bing,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Chandler Bing,...Dinah?
Chandler Bing,"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
Chandler Bing,Boys? We're going in.
Chandler Bing,"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
Chandler Bing,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done."
Chandler Bing,What does she do?
Chandler Bing,"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred."
Chandler Bing,"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise."
Chandler Bing,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
Chandler Bing,"""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
Chandler Bing,"Hey, that was really good!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
Chandler Bing,"""Smoke away."""
Chandler Bing,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Chandler Bing,Relax your hand!
Chandler Bing,Not so much!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
Chandler Bing,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Chandler Bing,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
Chandler Bing,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
Chandler Bing,"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
Chandler Bing,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
Chandler Bing,And this- is my reward!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
Chandler Bing,"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out."
Chandler Bing,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhoff impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
Chandler Bing,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
Chandler Bing,"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
Chandler Bing,"Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!"
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too."
Chandler Bing,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?"
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"
Chandler Bing,...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Chandler Bing,"I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, alright."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
Chandler Bing,You got waaaay too much free time.
Chandler Bing,"Happy birthday, pal!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty."""
Chandler Bing,Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Chandler Bing,"C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?"
Chandler Bing,I have no idea.
Chandler Bing,You got it.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, this is not that bad."
Chandler Bing,...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Chandler Bing,We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Bunny?"
Chandler Bing,Could've been a peach.
Chandler Bing,What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Chandler Bing,"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
Chandler Bing,He's open!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
Chandler Bing,'Scuse me.
Chandler Bing,"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room."
Chandler Bing,"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
Chandler Bing,Then what?
Chandler Bing,"So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh."
Chandler Bing,"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
Chandler Bing,"No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
Chandler Bing,"You gotta do it, man."
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
Chandler Bing,"Alright. Yes, this is Rachel."
Chandler Bing,"To the left, to the left- aww!"
Chandler Bing,"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
Chandler Bing,"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!"
Chandler Bing,Not a one.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, right, right, shut up."
Chandler Bing,"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
Chandler Bing,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
Chandler Bing,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Chandler Bing,Yuh-huh.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
Chandler Bing,There you go.
Chandler Bing,Where are they? Where are they?
Chandler Bing,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Chandler Bing,Here we go.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Janice."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,What... did you get me there?
Chandler Bing,Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Chandler Bing,That's great.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
Chandler Bing,That's it?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
Chandler Bing,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
Chandler Bing,"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
Chandler Bing,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
Chandler Bing,I'm fine.
Chandler Bing,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Chandler Bing,How do you do that?
Chandler Bing,We should always always break up together.
Chandler Bing,I'm free! I'm free!
Chandler Bing,"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
Chandler Bing,"Ross, ten o'clock."
Chandler Bing,"No, ten o'clock."
Chandler Bing,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!"
Chandler Bing,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
Chandler Bing,"Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here."
Chandler Bing,"Thank you, buddy."
Chandler Bing,Y'think?
Chandler Bing,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue..."
Chandler Bing,Here goes.
Chandler Bing,"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight."
Chandler Bing,"She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, kids."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
Chandler Bing,It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Chandler Bing,"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
Chandler Bing,We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
Chandler Bing,Who's Rick?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so you're divorced?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
Chandler Bing,"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
Chandler Bing,"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
Chandler Bing,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
Chandler Bing,...Hm.
Chandler Bing,What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Chandler Bing,"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
Chandler Bing,Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Chandler Bing,"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
Chandler Bing,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness."
Chandler Bing,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Chandler Bing,"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.."
Chandler Bing,"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?"
Chandler Bing,"God, I love these fingers..."
Chandler Bing,"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.."
Chandler Bing,Don't go.
Chandler Bing,"Too bad, she's leaving."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
Chandler Bing,"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
Chandler Bing,"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
Chandler Bing,You.
Chandler Bing,"Nono, just you."
Chandler Bing,Lose the other guys.
Chandler Bing,"C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
Chandler Bing,"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'"
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
Chandler Bing,...The second guy.
Chandler Bing,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
Chandler Bing,"""Big guy?"""
Chandler Bing,Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, great. This is just..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
Chandler Bing,"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
Chandler Bing,Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!"
Chandler Bing,There you go!
Chandler Bing,You're definitely scaring here.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, it's me."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
Chandler Bing,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Chandler Bing,Put Joey on the phone.
Chandler Bing,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
Chandler Bing,"Um, is it sugarless?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it."
Chandler Bing,"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself."
Chandler Bing,"Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go."
Chandler Bing,"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth."
Chandler Bing,"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking."
Chandler Bing,Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Chandler Bing,OK.
Chandler Bing,"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
Chandler Bing,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
Chandler Bing,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Chandler Bing,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
Chandler Bing,Yes please.
Chandler Bing,He's a he?
Chandler Bing,"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
Chandler Bing,You did?
Chandler Bing,"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
Chandler Bing,You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Chandler Bing,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
Chandler Bing,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
Chandler Bing,WHAT IS IT?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
Chandler Bing,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, gorgeous."
Chandler Bing,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
Chandler Bing,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
Chandler Bing,"...Quality, right, great."
Chandler Bing,"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
Chandler Bing,"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
Chandler Bing,Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Chandler Bing,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
Chandler Bing,You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Chandler Bing,"You are a frightening, frightening man."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no-"
Chandler Bing,"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Who are those people?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Lowell."
Chandler Bing,So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Chandler Bing,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
Chandler Bing,Really.
Chandler Bing,So- you can tell?
Chandler Bing,"So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
Chandler Bing,He is?
Chandler Bing,"Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Chandler Bing,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman."
Chandler Bing,Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Chandler Bing,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, every single one of them."
Chandler Bing,I thought it was $98.50.
Chandler Bing,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
Chandler Bing,"All right, I'm nine years old."
Chandler Bing,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
Chandler Bing,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Chandler Bing,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you must stop shooping."
Chandler Bing,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
Chandler Bing,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
Chandler Bing,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Chandler Bing,Do either of you have the keys?
Chandler Bing,For an emergency just like this.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go."
Chandler Bing,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Chandler Bing,Shall I carve?
Chandler Bing,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
Chandler Bing,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
Chandler Bing,"Here, here!"
Chandler Bing,Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Chandler Bing,He's finally happy with that and walks away.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
Chandler Bing,Might wanna open with the snowman.
Chandler Bing,"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"
Chandler Bing,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
Chandler Bing,That guy's going home with a note!
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
Chandler Bing,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
Chandler Bing,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
Chandler Bing,Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Chandler Bing,"Aah, y'killing me!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
Chandler Bing,Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Chandler Bing,I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Chandler Bing,"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
Chandler Bing,With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..."
Chandler Bing,You remember Janice.
Chandler Bing,But you found me!
Chandler Bing,Kill me. Kill me now.
Chandler Bing,"Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Chandler Bing,"Oh, will you give me the thing."
Chandler Bing,And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.
Chandler Bing,"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you."
Chandler Bing,And the moment of joy is upon us.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!"
Chandler Bing,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
Chandler Bing,"Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
Chandler Bing,You can say that because she's not your mom.
Chandler Bing,"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
Chandler Bing,Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Chandler Bing,THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Chandler Bing,This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Chandler Bing,...And then he burst into flames.
Chandler Bing,Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
Chandler Bing,I know I am.
Chandler Bing,"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
Chandler Bing,What are you guys doing out here?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God.
Chandler Bing,I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,You knew about this?
Chandler Bing,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
Chandler Bing,I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you did this.
Chandler Bing,I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Chandler Bing,You gotta let me slam the door!
Chandler Bing,What was that?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare."
Chandler Bing,"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
Chandler Bing,That's very funny. We done now?
Chandler Bing,"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
Chandler Bing,"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
Chandler Bing,You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Chandler Bing,Really stupid.
Chandler Bing,Yeah. No. No...
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, okay."
Chandler Bing,Nice save.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, why not. So I told her."
Chandler Bing,Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Chandler Bing,Pretty good! I told her.
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no, we're done."
Chandler Bing,"And, we're done with the yogurt."
Chandler Bing,"Mma, Mma, Mmaah"
Chandler Bing,"Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
Chandler Bing,"Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
Chandler Bing,You think?
Chandler Bing,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
Chandler Bing,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
Chandler Bing,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
Chandler Bing,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
Chandler Bing,You think we're ready for something like that?
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
Chandler Bing,I'm not moving out.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
Chandler Bing,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
Chandler Bing,"Aw, don't do that"
Chandler Bing,Hey Phoebe!
Chandler Bing,Fine.
Chandler Bing,"More coffee over here, please!"
Chandler Bing,Ooooohh!
Chandler Bing,So what are you gonna do?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
Chandler Bing,That's patio furniture!
Chandler Bing,What about the birds?
Chandler Bing,You pick one.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
Chandler Bing,"Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!"
Chandler Bing,"So, what do you think?"
Chandler Bing,I know!
Chandler Bing,"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
Chandler Bing,"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!"
Chandler Bing,Wha-
Chandler Bing,What is it?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,We already knew that!
Chandler Bing,Shut-out!!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, get out!"
Chandler Bing,One more game?
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry!
Chandler Bing,"Rachel, wait, wait."
Chandler Bing,Can I just say one thing?
Chandler Bing,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yes, could I have one of those."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
Chandler Bing,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
Chandler Bing,"Okaaay, rock, hard place, me."
Chandler Bing,"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
Chandler Bing,Huh.
Chandler Bing,"Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
Chandler Bing,What? What?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
Chandler Bing,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good. Rog is here."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
Chandler Bing,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
Chandler Bing,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
Chandler Bing,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
Chandler Bing,"C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late."""
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're gonna."
Chandler Bing,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
Chandler Bing,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
Chandler Bing,Yeah. I really do.
Chandler Bing,Get off!
Chandler Bing,What? What?
Chandler Bing,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
Chandler Bing,Basically we just feel that he's...
Chandler Bing,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Chandler Bing,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
Chandler Bing,Any contact?
Chandler Bing,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third..."
Chandler Bing,I think it's winning.
Chandler Bing,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
Chandler Bing,"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
Chandler Bing,...And what did you bring?
Chandler Bing,Janice?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, it's Janice."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
Chandler Bing,Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
Chandler Bing,That's OK.
Chandler Bing,What? What can't you do?
Chandler Bing,"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, you can not do this to me."
Chandler Bing,I hope she throws up on you.
Chandler Bing,So...
Chandler Bing,"Oh, what a crappy night!"
Chandler Bing,Excuse me. How ya doin'?
Chandler Bing,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Chandler Bing,You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Chandler Bing,"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know..."
Chandler Bing,"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, well, this was very special."
Chandler Bing,Janice is gonna go away now.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good, Joey's home now."
Chandler Bing,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
Chandler Bing,"Hi, Just Janice."
Chandler Bing,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out."
Chandler Bing,It is?
Chandler Bing,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no I don't."
Chandler Bing,"I did, but..."
Chandler Bing,Call me!
Chandler Bing,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
Chandler Bing,So.... I quit.
Chandler Bing,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Chandler Bing,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
Chandler Bing,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Chandler Bing,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Chandler Bing,I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Chandler Bing,Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Chandler Bing,"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
Chandler Bing,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the ""a-gogo."""
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
Chandler Bing,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Chandler Bing,Who are you going out with?
Chandler Bing,And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Chandler Bing,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
Chandler Bing,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
Chandler Bing,Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Chandler Bing,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?"
Chandler Bing,....with??
Chandler Bing,It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Chandler Bing,Again?
Chandler Bing,"Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!"
Chandler Bing,Well?
Chandler Bing,Look at this!
Chandler Bing,Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Chandler Bing,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
Chandler Bing,"This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
Chandler Bing,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
Chandler Bing,"Last time I do that, I promise."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa...."
Chandler Bing,"This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now."
Chandler Bing,Its Phoebe! Hi!
Chandler Bing,"Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?"
Chandler Bing,Can we start over?
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister."
Chandler Bing,Theyre twins!
Chandler Bing,"You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?"
Chandler Bing,Lets not do that any more.
Chandler Bing,Your sister Ursula.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym."
Chandler Bing,"And to you too, Helen."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay. Send her in."
Chandler Bing,"Hi, Nina. Come on in."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers."
Chandler Bing,"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
Chandler Bing,WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Chandler Bing,"Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute."
Chandler Bing,"So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, where you been?"
Chandler Bing,Score.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err..."
Chandler Bing,"Mr. D, hows it going, sir?"
Chandler Bing,And?
Chandler Bing,So what does this mean?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;"
Chandler Bing,Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me."
Chandler Bing,Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Chandler Bing,"Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights."
Chandler Bing,"Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade."
Chandler Bing,"Knit, good woman, knit, knit!"
Chandler Bing,And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan."
Chandler Bing,"And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
Chandler Bing,"And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir."
Chandler Bing,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
Chandler Bing,"Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us."
Chandler Bing,"Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise."
Chandler Bing,"Sure, why not?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?"
Chandler Bing,Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I ended up telling her everything."
Chandler Bing,"Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk."
Chandler Bing,Youre not gonna lose him.
Chandler Bing,That's nice.
Chandler Bing,What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
Chandler Bing,"Well, only if you order stuff."
Chandler Bing,There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Chandler Bing,And your friend Phoebe?
Chandler Bing,"Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, what have we learned so far?"
Chandler Bing,"""Happy Birthday Peehe."""
Chandler Bing,Did you see Betty?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
Chandler Bing,"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
Chandler Bing,"You know, you think I would."
Chandler Bing,What's up with the simian?
Chandler Bing,Okay... ..whose turn is it?
Chandler Bing,"No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
Chandler Bing,Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Chandler Bing,We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Chandler Bing,"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad."
Chandler Bing,Pudo aver sido General Tso!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?"
Chandler Bing,Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Chandler Bing,...little playthings with yarn?
Chandler Bing,Could you want her more?
Chandler Bing,"Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening."
Chandler Bing,We're notwe're not saying anything.
Chandler Bing,"We were playing poker, alright..."
Chandler Bing,And then he did.
Chandler Bing,There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Chandler Bing,"OK, so now we draw cards."
Chandler Bing,"OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
Chandler Bing,"OK, so at this point, the dealer..."
Chandler Bing,"OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards."
Chandler Bing,"Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
Chandler Bing,"The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so..."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : ""When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"""
Chandler Bing,"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?"
Chandler Bing,"That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
Chandler Bing,Couldn't be more out.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
Chandler Bing,Call.
Chandler Bing,": What do you need, what do you need?"
Chandler Bing,"Alright, here's ten."
Chandler Bing,Good luck.
Chandler Bing,: I thought we had them!
Chandler Bing,Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Chandler Bing,Go.
Chandler Bing,Toootal chick-flick.
Chandler Bing,"They're still just friends, right?"
Chandler Bing,I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Chandler Bing,"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
Chandler Bing,I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
Chandler Bing,Rachel lost Marcel.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room."
Chandler Bing,Marcel?
Chandler Bing,Marcel?
Chandler Bing,"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something..."
Chandler Bing,Yes have you seen any?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
Chandler Bing,Marcel?!
Chandler Bing,Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Chandler Bing,I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Chandler Bing,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
Chandler Bing,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine."
Chandler Bing,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
Chandler Bing,"And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
Chandler Bing,Hey Rach!
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,I have my reasons.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I've been honing!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
Chandler Bing,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Chandler Bing,Can I use your phone?
Chandler Bing,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
Chandler Bing,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Chandler Bing,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
Chandler Bing,She answered.
Chandler Bing,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
Chandler Bing,"If it helps, I could slide over."
Chandler Bing,Hello? Hello?
Chandler Bing,So how's Mindy?
Chandler Bing,Hell is filled with people like you.
Chandler Bing,...And boogie!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
Chandler Bing,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
Chandler Bing,"No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
Chandler Bing,'S'why I'm dancing...
Chandler Bing,"Ring dammit, ring!"
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
Chandler Bing,Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Chandler Bing,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
Chandler Bing,What are you doing here?
Chandler Bing,"...I'm, I'm okay."
Chandler Bing,"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,...I dunno.
Chandler Bing,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
Chandler Bing,"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
Chandler Bing,How about Joey... Pepponi?
Chandler Bing,Joey... Switzerland?
Chandler Bing,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Chandler Bing,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
Chandler Bing,Might wanna try Joseph.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
Chandler Bing,So what does this mean?
Chandler Bing,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
Chandler Bing,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Chandler Bing,...Take off their hats!
Chandler Bing,You're kidding.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
Chandler Bing,"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego."
Chandler Bing,...He's in.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
Chandler Bing,Tell me what?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me."
Chandler Bing,Wow!
Chandler Bing,"More importantly, was I any good?"
Chandler Bing,"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate."
Chandler Bing,You're okay there?
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
Chandler Bing,Hello Rachel.
Chandler Bing,Pirates again?
Chandler Bing,"Thanks Joey, that's a good idea."
Chandler Bing,"Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story."
Chandler Bing,"Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
Chandler Bing,"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
Chandler Bing,When we were?
Chandler Bing,Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Chandler Bing,Can you hear that?
Chandler Bing,See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Chandler Bing,I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Ah!
Chandler Bing,"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Bye bye.
Chandler Bing,Yes?
Chandler Bing,Ooh.
Chandler Bing,"See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me."
Chandler Bing,Why not?
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Chandler Bing,What are you talking about?
Chandler Bing,I can't belive it.
Chandler Bing,They do me?
Chandler Bing,I don't sound like that.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true."
Chandler Bing,"That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
Chandler Bing,And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Chandler Bing,Sorry.
Chandler Bing,Tyrannosaurus!
Chandler Bing,Work people? Nobody told me.
Chandler Bing,"You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
Chandler Bing,You think I should?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Then, I don't get it."
Chandler Bing,They do?
Chandler Bing,I just wan't to...
Chandler Bing,But I just wa...
Chandler Bing,"Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock."
Chandler Bing,"You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
Chandler Bing,"Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend."
Chandler Bing,"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, like in a cab..."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, hating this."
Chandler Bing,"Here we go, here we go."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
Chandler Bing,You have to pick your moments.
Chandler Bing,I used to have that bumper sticker.
Chandler Bing,You see what I mean.
Chandler Bing,"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
Chandler Bing,You'll get one.
Chandler Bing,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, uh."
Chandler Bing,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Chandler Bing,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
Chandler Bing,No reason.
Chandler Bing,Where have you been?
Chandler Bing,Mazel tov!
Chandler Bing,You are really frightening me.
Chandler Bing,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?"
Chandler Bing,"Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?"
Chandler Bing,"I know, I still am one of these."
Chandler Bing,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this."
Chandler Bing,"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
Chandler Bing,... And where's this money coming from?
Chandler Bing,Men are here.
Chandler Bing,"Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
Chandler Bing,Crazy bitch.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
Chandler Bing,Forget about her.
Chandler Bing,"Course there, they just call it food."
Chandler Bing,I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Chandler Bing,Ooooh.
Chandler Bing,"OK, this one right here is from me."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's Ross's."
Chandler Bing,"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?"
Chandler Bing,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
Chandler Bing,ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Chandler Bing,F-hah.... flennin....
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no...."
Chandler Bing,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Chandler Bing,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
Chandler Bing,H-He's in China!
Chandler Bing,What about the time difference?
Chandler Bing,Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Chandler Bing,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Chandler Bing,"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, big..."
Chandler Bing,...spender.
Chandler Bing,So how'd it go?
Chandler Bing,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
Chandler Bing,I didn't know you had another level.
Chandler Bing,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
Chandler Bing,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
Chandler Bing,No way!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
Chandler Bing,"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Rach, can I get..."
Chandler Bing,Not yet.
Chandler Bing,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
Chandler Bing,God?
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
Chandler Bing,"Well, you owe me one, big guy."
Chandler Bing,"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever."
Chandler Bing,You have to really wanna see it.
Chandler Bing,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Chandler Bing,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
Chandler Bing,Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Chandler Bing,"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
Chandler Bing,What stupid thing did you do?
Chandler Bing,People do stupid things when they're upset.
Chandler Bing,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered."
Chandler Bing,Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Chandler Bing,At least as long as I have the pants.
Chandler Bing,"Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!"
Chandler Bing,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
Chandler Bing,Cupping.
Chandler Bing,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Chandler Bing,That's ok.
Chandler Bing,"You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back."
Chandler Bing,We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Chandler Bing,Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Chandler Bing,"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, sweetums."
Chandler Bing,"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
Chandler Bing,What did you just do?
Chandler Bing,What did you just do?
Chandler Bing,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Chandler Bing,Howdy.
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
Chandler Bing,What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Chandler Bing,"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?"
Chandler Bing,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Chandler Bing,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,I broke up with her.
Chandler Bing,"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
Chandler Bing,"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain."
Chandler Bing,You or me?
Chandler Bing,Maureen Rosilla.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, Phoebe."
Chandler Bing,"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed."
Chandler Bing,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances."""
Chandler Bing,"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, he looks so normal."
Chandler Bing,Funniest? Heckles?
Chandler Bing,"Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?"
Chandler Bing,Whoa!
Chandler Bing,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool."
Chandler Bing,"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?"
Chandler Bing,"Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."
Chandler Bing,"Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction."
Chandler Bing,"What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?"
Chandler Bing,How do you know that? How?
Chandler Bing,"You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I understand."
Chandler Bing,You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Chandler Bing,"Hi, it's me."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, my, god!"
Chandler Bing,"Janice, you're--"
Chandler Bing,Is it--?
Chandler Bing,Congratulations.
Chandler Bing,You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Chandler Bing,Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Chandler Bing,"Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake."
Chandler Bing,"If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!"
Chandler Bing,"Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."
Chandler Bing,In a bad way?
Chandler Bing,Whoa! Don't know about that.
Chandler Bing,"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing."
Chandler Bing,I'll take that.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it."
Chandler Bing,"Takin' that with you, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down."
Chandler Bing,Sure.
Chandler Bing,I didn't know it was a big secret.
Chandler Bing,You bitch.
Chandler Bing,"C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
Chandler Bing,Joey was in a porno movie.
Chandler Bing,"If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me."
Chandler Bing,"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia."
Chandler Bing,"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?"
Chandler Bing,"No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny."
Chandler Bing,"Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . ."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Julie."
Chandler Bing,"Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright."
Chandler Bing,What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Chandler Bing,"OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen."
Chandler Bing,Nice work my friend.
Chandler Bing,"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
Chandler Bing,I got the time to get to know Julie.
Chandler Bing,I'm goin' home.
Chandler Bing,"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there."
Chandler Bing,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Bob here.
Chandler Bing,What've you been up to?
Chandler Bing,Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
Chandler Bing,I'm back.
Chandler Bing,"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
Chandler Bing,Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Chandler Bing,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake."
Chandler Bing,"Look guys, I know it's a little steep."
Chandler Bing,But it's Ross.
Chandler Bing,"I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."
Chandler Bing,"You know, I think I might just."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods."
Chandler Bing,"We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy."
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something."
Chandler Bing,Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?"
Chandler Bing,"No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number."
Chandler Bing,"I will have the uh, Cajun catfish."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?"
Chandler Bing,"Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback."
Chandler Bing,You can tell us.
Chandler Bing,We can talk about that.
Chandler Bing,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"
Chandler Bing,"No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
Chandler Bing,Together.
Chandler Bing,"So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?"
Chandler Bing,"By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall."
Chandler Bing,"Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!"
Chandler Bing,"If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel."
Chandler Bing,Why did you look at me when you said that?
Chandler Bing,Fine.
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Chandler Bing,"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming."
Chandler Bing,"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign."
Chandler Bing,I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Chandler Bing,Bob here.
Chandler Bing,"So, uh, you met someone, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"So, uh, how was he?"
Chandler Bing,Eh?
Chandler Bing,"Well, that makes me feel so good."
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it."
Chandler Bing,"So, let's go."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe the guys missed this.
Chandler Bing,Chandler.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we really missed you guys."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this."
Chandler Bing,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
Chandler Bing,I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody."
Chandler Bing,Can I uh see something?
Chandler Bing,"Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat."
Chandler Bing,We'll watch him.
Chandler Bing,"I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window."
Chandler Bing,You understood that?
Chandler Bing,Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Chandler Bing,"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?"
Chandler Bing,"No, I got him."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, seriously you want him?"
Chandler Bing,Hello.
Chandler Bing,"Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, we are great guys."
Chandler Bing,"That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!"
Chandler Bing,Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink."
Chandler Bing,You done?
Chandler Bing,You know it?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, sure, they love us over there."
Chandler Bing,Ben! Ben! Ben!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
Chandler Bing,"Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er."
Chandler Bing,Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
Chandler Bing,That's me.
Chandler Bing,"Actually, uh, we're both the father."
Chandler Bing,Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Chandler Bing,Ok.
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off."
Chandler Bing,What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
Chandler Bing,"All right, call it in the air."
Chandler Bing,Heads it is.
Chandler Bing,We have to assign heads to something.
Chandler Bing,What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, he's not crying."
Chandler Bing,"You, you are gonna love this."
Chandler Bing,"Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!"
Chandler Bing,"OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?"
Chandler Bing,"Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?"
Chandler Bing,"Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home."
Chandler Bing,"OK, let's do it. What?"
Chandler Bing,And we're changing.
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them."
Chandler Bing,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore."
Chandler Bing,"Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it."
Chandler Bing,So you really OK about all this?
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday."
Chandler Bing,Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Chandler Bing,"OK, stop."
Chandler Bing,"Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over."
Chandler Bing,"OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret."
Chandler Bing,"Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have."
Chandler Bing,"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
Chandler Bing,"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
Chandler Bing,And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Chandler Bing,"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
Chandler Bing,"So, you feel like goin' for a run?"
Chandler Bing,"Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here."
Chandler Bing,OK.
Chandler Bing,"All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s."
Chandler Bing,Games and stuff.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight."
Chandler Bing,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column."
Chandler Bing,"No, Amish boy."
Chandler Bing,Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Chandler Bing,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?"
Chandler Bing,"I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?"
Chandler Bing,"So, Spock actually hugs his father?"
Chandler Bing,Ohhh.
Chandler Bing,What? Nothing.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing."
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Alright. ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."""
Chandler Bing,Good luck.
Chandler Bing,"My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary."
Chandler Bing,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up."
Chandler Bing,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason."
Chandler Bing,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?"
Chandler Bing,What are you doing out there?
Chandler Bing,"Look, maybe we should go?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad."
Chandler Bing,And twenty-five it is.
Chandler Bing,"Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?"
Chandler Bing,Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,What's in the bag?
Chandler Bing,"Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame."
Chandler Bing,"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up."
Chandler Bing,Who said anything about Christmas?
Chandler Bing,So whaddya got there Monica?
Chandler Bing,Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Eeeshk.
Chandler Bing,OK.
Chandler Bing,"OK. Brake left, gas right?"
Chandler Bing,Where's my seat belt?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so that's what this is for."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Alright.
Chandler Bing,"Alright, we're gettin' closer."
Chandler Bing,"Well, so why not go knock?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out."
Chandler Bing,"Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone."
Chandler Bing,"OK, Phoebs, your turn."
Chandler Bing,"And, a lemon lime."
Chandler Bing,And last but not least.
Chandler Bing,I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Guess who's back in show business.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead."
Chandler Bing,"OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia."
Chandler Bing,Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Chandler Bing,Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Chandler Bing,"Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross."
Chandler Bing,"You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,Oh my... God?
Chandler Bing,"So, what're you gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know."
Chandler Bing,Well is she...
Chandler Bing,It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas."
Chandler Bing,Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium."
Chandler Bing,"And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues."
Chandler Bing,"OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins."
Chandler Bing,"No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?"
Chandler Bing,Me.
Chandler Bing,It's my game. You want the job or not?
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Chandler Bing,So what'd you do?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hey."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm sorry man."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor."
Chandler Bing,"Whoa, she's pretty."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ok."
Chandler Bing,Nice!
Chandler Bing,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
Chandler Bing,"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah."
Chandler Bing,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Chandler Bing,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?"
Chandler Bing,"Believe me, sometimes that happens."
Chandler Bing,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true."
Chandler Bing,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Chandler Bing,"Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles."
Chandler Bing,"Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon."
Chandler Bing,"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah?"
Chandler Bing,"I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?"
Chandler Bing,All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Chandler Bing,Isn't Ben in this?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem."
Chandler Bing,Rhythm?
Chandler Bing,"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion."
Chandler Bing,Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Chandler Bing,Hello.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
Chandler Bing,The one time they're not home.
Chandler Bing,That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Chandler Bing,"Wait, wait, wait."
Chandler Bing,"Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac."
Chandler Bing,Very informative!
Chandler Bing,That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Chandler Bing,"And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard."
Chandler Bing,"What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?"
Chandler Bing,"So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid."
Chandler Bing,"Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya."
Chandler Bing,Ahhhh.
Chandler Bing,"Uh, yes, yes it is."
Chandler Bing,Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
Chandler Bing,"Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore."
Chandler Bing,"No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows."
Chandler Bing,"OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money."
Chandler Bing,"Oh uh, o, OK."
Chandler Bing,"Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock."
Chandler Bing,No one was around to hear that?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done."
Chandler Bing,"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
Chandler Bing,"Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?"
Chandler Bing,"OK, then, eat me, I'm done."
Chandler Bing,"I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'"
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops."
Chandler Bing,"Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there."
Chandler Bing,You want me to wear your panties?
Chandler Bing,"Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell."
Chandler Bing,I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
Chandler Bing,Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
Chandler Bing,"Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp."
Chandler Bing,I'm going to the bathroom now.
Chandler Bing,I can't believe we're doing this.
Chandler Bing,Alrighty.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,"OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?"
Chandler Bing,OK.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie."
Chandler Bing,"Huh? Where, whaddya mean?"
Chandler Bing,"What, what's what you mean?"
Chandler Bing,That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Chandler Bing,"Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back."
Chandler Bing,Joey?
Chandler Bing,Joey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes."
Chandler Bing,Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, this is the first time."
Chandler Bing,"I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them."
Chandler Bing,"No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, you don't have to see."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, one of you give me your underpants."
Chandler Bing,How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Chandler Bing,Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Chandler Bing,"Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?"
Chandler Bing,How long you been waitin' to say that?
Chandler Bing,Hey. Hold on a second. Huh?
Chandler Bing,What's this?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, I don't know what to say. Wow, I, I don't know what to say."
Chandler Bing,I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Chandler Bing,To my best bud. Thanks best bud.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion."
Chandler Bing,I so am.
Chandler Bing,"Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, she's goin' somewhere."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you feelin' better?"
Chandler Bing,"Ya know, the man's got a point."
Chandler Bing,"That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy."
Chandler Bing,"No, I'm alright, thanks."
Chandler Bing,"I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's."
Chandler Bing,Chandler.
Chandler Bing,"What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection."
Chandler Bing,"I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good."
Chandler Bing,"Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad."
Chandler Bing,"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?"
Chandler Bing,"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there."
Chandler Bing,"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . ."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe it.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay."
Chandler Bing,"What am I gonna do, huh?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Well this one's for you.
Chandler Bing,"No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds."
Chandler Bing,That's what they'll call us.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained."
Chandler Bing,"OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut."
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
Chandler Bing,Work on your music?
Chandler Bing,"Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes."
Chandler Bing,Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Chandler Bing,Congratulations!
Chandler Bing,"So uh, which one is mine?"
Chandler Bing,Ohh yes.
Chandler Bing,Do we dare?
Chandler Bing,Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Chandler Bing,"Woah, hey, yo."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, yo."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up."
Chandler Bing,I'll cancel the sodas.
Chandler Bing,You got a Cheeto on your face man.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,So how'd it go?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin."
Chandler Bing,It's the Miracle Wax.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice."
Chandler Bing,Could you get us a couple of beers?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, woah, hey, woah."
Chandler Bing,She's one of us now.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Goodnight.
Chandler Bing,Well maybe he was nervous.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time."
Chandler Bing,"That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years."
Chandler Bing,Waaa-aaah.
Chandler Bing,The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Chandler Bing,Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Chandler Bing,"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere."
Chandler Bing,Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?"
Chandler Bing,"Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?"
Chandler Bing,"Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"I know, this is a great apartment."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously."
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK."
Chandler Bing,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it."
Chandler Bing,Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
Chandler Bing,"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
Chandler Bing,Well then maybe you should take it.
Chandler Bing,Fine with me.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Yeah me too.
Chandler Bing,Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
Chandler Bing,So I got ya something.
Chandler Bing,Lick away my man.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?"
Chandler Bing,Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Chandler Bing,"Well, there you go."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there."
Chandler Bing,I did pay for half of it.
Chandler Bing,"Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it."
Chandler Bing,Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Chandler Bing,Stop talkin' to your men.
Chandler Bing,Congratulations.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I remember."
Chandler Bing,"So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?"
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago."
Chandler Bing,"So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today."

Chandler Bing,"Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest."
Chandler Bing,Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Chandler Bing,That's right my friend. It's time for...
Chandler Bing,I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Chandler Bing,"Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?"
Chandler Bing,"See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind."
Chandler Bing,"But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together."
Chandler Bing,But...
Chandler Bing,"So uhh, how's the palace?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news."
Chandler Bing,"Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie."
Chandler Bing,"Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room."
Chandler Bing,"Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare."
Chandler Bing,Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Chandler Bing,Morning.
Chandler Bing,"Oh it's uh, over there on the table."
Chandler Bing,"No, Eddie likes to keep it over there."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ooh."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good."
Chandler Bing,See ya.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I couldn't be happier."
Chandler Bing,There's another carton right over there.
Chandler Bing,"Alright, so what's it about?"
Chandler Bing,Well I like both eggs equally.
Chandler Bing,"Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch."
Chandler Bing,You don't like that show?
Chandler Bing,Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Chandler Bing,"Oh o-, OK man."
Chandler Bing,You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Chandler Bing,God that is good TV.
Chandler Bing,"Phoebs, play with meeee."
Chandler Bing,"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time."
Chandler Bing,"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball."
Chandler Bing,"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
Chandler Bing,We don't need to remedy that.
Chandler Bing,That was so lame.
Chandler Bing,"So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?"
Chandler Bing,What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Chandler Bing,Well it's not Sean Penn.
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, oh, c'mon in."
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul."
Chandler Bing,"Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little..."
Chandler Bing,Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Chandler Bing,Bye.
Chandler Bing,"So, we gettin' a fish?"
Chandler Bing,"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend."
Chandler Bing,"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story."
Chandler Bing,Buddy?
Chandler Bing,There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Chandler Bing,Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Chandler Bing,"So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes."
Chandler Bing,Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Chandler Bing,"Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way."
Chandler Bing,We're worried about you.
Chandler Bing,We came over as soon as we saw.
Chandler Bing,It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry man.
Chandler Bing,Uhhhaahh.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?"
Chandler Bing,"Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?"
Chandler Bing,"Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, good night. You big freak of nature."
Chandler Bing,Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,I can't sleep now.
Chandler Bing,"No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now."
Chandler Bing,Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Chandler Bing,I didn't realize that.
Chandler Bing,GET OUT NOW!!
Chandler Bing,Yes please.
Chandler Bing,I want you out.
Chandler Bing,Where did you hear it from before?
Chandler Bing,Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Chandler Bing,"Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?"
Chandler Bing,"Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?"
Chandler Bing,Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Chandler Bing,Your last roommate's kidney?
Chandler Bing,Daaahhhh!
Chandler Bing,"Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching."
Chandler Bing,Uuuh.
Chandler Bing,"Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out."
Chandler Bing,"You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!"
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,"This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue."
Chandler Bing,You want some help.
Chandler Bing,"Ding dong, the psycho's gone."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!"
Chandler Bing,Our next cocktail party?
Chandler Bing,"Eddie, do you remember yesterday?"
Chandler Bing,Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Chandler Bing,So what happened?
Chandler Bing,Oh sweet Moses.
Chandler Bing,May I help you?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?"
Chandler Bing,"I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man."
Chandler Bing,"Well I, I think we'd remember something like that."
Chandler Bing,See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Chandler Bing,Welcome home man.
Chandler Bing,Absolutely.
Chandler Bing,Ah that's a cantelope.
Chandler Bing,"Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?"
Chandler Bing,"I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?"
Chandler Bing,"So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog."
Chandler Bing,"Well, how do you find clothes that fit?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'"
Chandler Bing,"Ok, that's Eric."
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, this could be tough."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, you almost had it."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Your boyfriend is so cool.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15."
Chandler Bing,"You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car ."
Chandler Bing,I think they get it.
Chandler Bing,There's the man.
Chandler Bing,"Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know."
Chandler Bing,"Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, didn't he tell ya?"
Chandler Bing,You hear that? We're the guys.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, big guy, game time."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel."
Chandler Bing,Kick save and... denied.
Chandler Bing,"Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's."
Chandler Bing,"See, that's why we don't let her play."
Chandler Bing,"Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time."
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal."
Chandler Bing,"No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work."
Chandler Bing,You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you got us into trouble.
Chandler Bing,"Man, I am so beat."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?"
Chandler Bing,"Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?"
Chandler Bing,"No actually, I was just going for colorful."
Chandler Bing,What just happened?
Chandler Bing,"That, that is funny. Can I have it back?"
Chandler Bing,No?
Chandler Bing,"Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?"
Chandler Bing,"No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page."
Chandler Bing,Hhhiiii.
Chandler Bing,The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Chandler Bing,"Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one."
Chandler Bing,"Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
Chandler Bing,"Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to."
Chandler Bing,Don't play with his things.
Chandler Bing,You had to ask.
Chandler Bing,I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Chandler Bing,Your cappucino sir.
Chandler Bing,Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Chandler Bing,"Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle."
Chandler Bing,Ok.
Chandler Bing,No?
Chandler Bing,"Alright, hang on a second there Custer."
Chandler Bing,"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back."
Chandler Bing,Would you come on! Come on! Thank you.
Chandler Bing,"Ah, there we go."
Chandler Bing,You burn your mouth?
Chandler Bing,"Bullies, big bullies."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, let's do this."
Chandler Bing,"Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it."
Chandler Bing,Ok.
Chandler Bing,Ok.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything."
Chandler Bing,"Ok so, can I have my hat back?"
Chandler Bing,Huh.
Chandler Bing,Hi Monica.
Chandler Bing,"Guys guys, check this out."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns."
Chandler Bing,Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Chandler Bing,"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship."
Chandler Bing,Why her mom?
Chandler Bing,Excuse me?
Chandler Bing,"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?"
Chandler Bing,"So, basically just a Chinese guy."
Chandler Bing,"Yes because uh, you look so young."
Chandler Bing,"NO! No, I'll take that for ya."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?"
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area."
Chandler Bing,"Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, they're coming, shhh."
Chandler Bing,"Well, we could count again."
Chandler Bing,"Look, are you gonna be ok?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, actually just one birthday flan."
Chandler Bing,"It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee."
Chandler Bing,"Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party."
Chandler Bing,Volleyball.
Chandler Bing,"Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, that's me."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
Chandler Bing,Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Chandler Bing,"I, I know."
Chandler Bing,"Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?"
Chandler Bing,"Sorry, we're on a major flan high."
Chandler Bing,"Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster..."
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, you can have it."
Chandler Bing,That was there when I got here.
Chandler Bing,Had it.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor."
Chandler Bing,"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
Chandler Bing,"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor."
Chandler Bing,I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?"
Chandler Bing,Well there you go.
Chandler Bing,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
Chandler Bing,Weird world. Your kids?
Chandler Bing,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Chandler Bing,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes."
Chandler Bing,Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas."
Chandler Bing,Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Chandler Bing,"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, if you say so sir."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm going to kill you."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Chandler Bing,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?"
Chandler Bing,"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go."
Chandler Bing,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did."
Chandler Bing,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer."
Chandler Bing,"No freakshow, she's fictional."
Chandler Bing,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, what did your agent say?"
Chandler Bing,And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Chandler Bing,I may have.
Chandler Bing,"Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet."
Chandler Bing,"I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy..."
Chandler Bing,"Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did."
Chandler Bing,"It's like this, me, no jokes."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum."
Chandler Bing,"Joey, no means no!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words."
Chandler Bing,It means we're holding hands.
Chandler Bing,I'm afraid I might just be.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her."
Chandler Bing,How do you not fall down more?
Chandler Bing,"All right. ""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."" She's married!"
Chandler Bing,I can't believe she's married.
Chandler Bing,What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'll do it!"
Chandler Bing,"Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?"
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, oh, oh, that's her."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,Huh.
Chandler Bing,Morning.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me."
Chandler Bing,I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
Chandler Bing,"Nope, not this time."
Chandler Bing,I'm not yanking you.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
Chandler Bing,I'm not breaking up with her!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Of!
Chandler Bing,"You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
Chandler Bing,"No, Janice."
Chandler Bing,"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, there you go."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters."
Chandler Bing,I want you to say that you like her!
Chandler Bing,"Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
Chandler Bing,"Umm, yeah."
Chandler Bing,"Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"
Chandler Bing,We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, okay."
Chandler Bing,Yeah! All right! You go first.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Chandler Bing,I know!
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
Chandler Bing,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
Chandler Bing,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!"
Chandler Bing,You said...
Chandler Bing,What are you guys doing together?
Chandler Bing,Really.
Chandler Bing,You still can't stand her can you?
Chandler Bing,"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I guess that's something."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Oh God!
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Taste it.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, mister tux!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up."
Chandler Bing,You're in my seat.
Chandler Bing,'Cause I was sitting there.
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back."
Chandler Bing,"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat."
Chandler Bing,"All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up."
Chandler Bing,Really!
Chandler Bing,"Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old."
Chandler Bing,"You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!"
Chandler Bing,Sorry Phoebe.
Chandler Bing,Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Chandler Bing,"All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable."
Chandler Bing,All right!
Chandler Bing,"All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!"
Chandler Bing,"Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's."
Chandler Bing,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!"""
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Chandler Bing,"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
Chandler Bing,We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Chandler Bing,The sheep.
Chandler Bing,He took my essence!
Chandler Bing,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions."
Chandler Bing,"What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?"
Chandler Bing,He's got nothing!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, aaaah!"
Chandler Bing,What are you supporting?
Chandler Bing,"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place."
Chandler Bing,"You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?"
Chandler Bing,"They got a phone in there, right?"
Chandler Bing,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Chandler Bing,Oooo-ooh!
Chandler Bing,"Jeez, what a baby."
Chandler Bing,Stop it. Stop it!
Chandler Bing,Excuse me. Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
Chandler Bing,"I mean, I was sitting there."
Chandler Bing,"But, I never left the room!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, that's it, give me your underwear."
Chandler Bing,"See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
Chandler Bing,Because the kids need new shoes.
Chandler Bing,Do I look fat?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her...."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
Chandler Bing,"That's easy, baggage claim."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something."
Chandler Bing,Thank you Rachel.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, the old hug and roll."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, one question."
Chandler Bing,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Chandler Bing,"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam."
Chandler Bing,"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
Chandler Bing,"That, that's what's stupid."
Chandler Bing,"Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'"
Chandler Bing,"No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard."
Chandler Bing,You mean there's more than one of us.
Chandler Bing,And that's how you bought it?
Chandler Bing,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
Chandler Bing,Sure. What's up?
Chandler Bing,You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's official there are no good movies."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, man. What's up?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
Chandler Bing,Is anybody else scared?
Chandler Bing,Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Chandler Bing,Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Chandler Bing,"Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
Chandler Bing,Noo.
Chandler Bing,"No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'"
Chandler Bing,"I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid."
Chandler Bing,"Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!"
Chandler Bing,Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Chandler Bing,You think?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way."
Chandler Bing,"'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this."
Chandler Bing,"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
Chandler Bing,"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip."
Chandler Bing,"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
Chandler Bing,"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
Chandler Bing,It doesn't scare me!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street."
Chandler Bing,"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down."
Chandler Bing,Then I got all needy and clingy.
Chandler Bing,She said she'd call me.
Chandler Bing,Oh God.
Chandler Bing,This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Chandler Bing,"So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?"
Chandler Bing,"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
Chandler Bing,"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
Chandler Bing,"Hello, Janice."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
Chandler Bing,No. Not anymore.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
Chandler Bing,Here in Chelsea.
Chandler Bing,A woman's
Chandler Bing,Chelsea.
Chandler Bing,Can I be that guy?
Chandler Bing,"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."
Chandler Bing,"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?"
Chandler Bing,Hello!
Chandler Bing,"What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!"
Chandler Bing,I love you too.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,You're building a post office?
Chandler Bing,Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Chandler Bing,Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Chandler Bing,"All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list."
Chandler Bing,"Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can't get mad."
Chandler Bing,"Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit."
Chandler Bing,"I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head."
Chandler Bing,Peter Parker.
Chandler Bing,What a geek!
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"We don't, really."
Chandler Bing,"You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city."
Chandler Bing,"No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!"
Chandler Bing,I do NOT want this unit!!
Chandler Bing,Fine!
Chandler Bing,"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
Chandler Bing,"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
Chandler Bing,"Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around."
Chandler Bing,"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time."
Chandler Bing,Have you seen Joey?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish."
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Chandler Bing,He started mine first!
Chandler Bing,"What, like a number?"
Chandler Bing,Hi! Bye!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, on three. One....Two...."
Chandler Bing,Why two?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, one...two..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good job Joe."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?"
Chandler Bing,Umm?
Chandler Bing,I've got five bucks says you can't.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I think I have the cash."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"I'm never gonna find a roommate, ever."
Chandler Bing,"Well let's see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that's plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!"
Chandler Bing,"Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who I'm not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone 'Chandler Bing,' he said 'Whoa-whoa, short message.'"
Chandler Bing,"Umm, how's it going with you guys?"
Chandler Bing,"Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
Chandler Bing,"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right."
Chandler Bing,"Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye."
Chandler Bing,Sure. Ummm. What's up?
Chandler Bing,What gay thing?
Chandler Bing,"Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Mon."
Chandler Bing,Do I ever.
Chandler Bing,No way!
Chandler Bing,Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
Chandler Bing,Can I get a beer.
Chandler Bing,You betcha!
Chandler Bing,"Um-mm, yeah right!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes, and that's what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but after that, we're shootin' some pool."
Chandler Bing,"Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball."
Chandler Bing,And now I've picked it up again.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, don't thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
Chandler Bing,"So ah, whatcha watching?"
Chandler Bing,What's it about?
Chandler Bing,"Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?"
Chandler Bing,Wow! Look at them run.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'll go get one."
Chandler Bing,"Well, hello!"
Chandler Bing,Do you have any beers? We're out of beers.
Chandler Bing,You okay?
Chandler Bing,Right.
Chandler Bing,"Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend."
Chandler Bing,"Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life."
Chandler Bing,"Umm, this is nice."
Chandler Bing,"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
Chandler Bing,"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, that sounds great. Oh, and listen, it's, it's gonna be...."
Chandler Bing,"Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you came back.
Chandler Bing,"If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best."
Chandler Bing,Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Chandler Bing,What a wank!
Chandler Bing,I'll go.
Chandler Bing,"See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig."
Chandler Bing,"Knock, knock."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
Chandler Bing,Okay. It's a racecar.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?"
Chandler Bing,You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Chandler Bing,You totally screwed him over.
Chandler Bing,"Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring."
Chandler Bing,I will have one.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'm not gonna have one."
Chandler Bing,All right I'll have one.
Chandler Bing,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Chandler Bing,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse."
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?"
Chandler Bing,"Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
Chandler Bing,"That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious."
Chandler Bing,"All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever."
Chandler Bing,Why not?!
Chandler Bing,What is the thing?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong."
Chandler Bing,"Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me."
Chandler Bing,"You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!"
Chandler Bing,All right!
Chandler Bing,"Joey told me, he saw you two kissing."
Chandler Bing,No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Chandler Bing,"Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!"
Chandler Bing,Here.
Chandler Bing,"I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?"
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,I talked to Janice.
Chandler Bing,"She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!"
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"
Chandler Bing,"Come on, tell me."
Chandler Bing,"What? What are you, what are you talking about?"
Chandler Bing,"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy."
Chandler Bing,"I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do."
Chandler Bing,Then don't leave me!
Chandler Bing,"Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
Chandler Bing,"No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance."
Chandler Bing,Ohhh. Don't go.
Chandler Bing,No. No! No! No!
Chandler Bing,I don't care! I don't care!!
Chandler Bing,You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Chandler Bing,I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Chandler Bing,"I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind."
Chandler Bing,No you know I don't mind.
Chandler Bing,Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,I've found.
Chandler Bing,"...in you, my endless love. My endless love."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play."
Chandler Bing,That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, all right, I'll play."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, you say that proudly."
Chandler Bing,And was the curse lifted?
Chandler Bing,"But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom won't let me cross the street."
Chandler Bing,And then Tineals.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Wow! Just like in the pros.
Chandler Bing,The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
Chandler Bing,"Sorry. I'm sorry. Y'know what, we're just gonna throw it."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, actually losers rhyme."
Chandler Bing,Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!! You wanna go shotgun?
Chandler Bing,Hike!
Chandler Bing,"Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna.. Hi, I'm Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Mar-haaaan.
Chandler Bing,Yeah! Why don't you stick around. You can sit right there.
Chandler Bing,"Well, that went well."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
Chandler Bing,"Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
Chandler Bing,"Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?"
Chandler Bing,"Math!! You're giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we'll see who gets her."
Chandler Bing,"Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math."
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Well, I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean!"
Chandler Bing,Before!!
Chandler Bing,Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, good."
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams."
Chandler Bing,"No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?"
Chandler Bing,"And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?"
Chandler Bing,Fine with me.
Chandler Bing,What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,Yes!!
Chandler Bing,"Well, you don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her."
Chandler Bing,"You hear that! That is her chose, mister I'll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!"
Chandler Bing,Wh-what?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, it doesn't matter, 'cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!"
Chandler Bing,We're not gonna lose to girls.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you're five feet short, so we win!"
Chandler Bing,"Guys! Guys! Come on! It's Thanksgiving, it's not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
Chandler Bing,"Eh..., I don't, I don't know."
Chandler Bing,"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?"
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
Chandler Bing,I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Chandler Bing,Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Chandler Bing,"Look out kids, he's coming!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York."
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
Chandler Bing,"How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?"
Chandler Bing,"He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want."
Chandler Bing,"Because, I'm too afraid."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here."
Chandler Bing,Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
Chandler Bing,I spelled out boobies.
Chandler Bing,"So, how many have you sold so far?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
Chandler Bing,Me! On my computer.
Chandler Bing,"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room."
Chandler Bing,Something else I might have said?
Chandler Bing,You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
Chandler Bing,"Run, Joey! Run for your life!"
Chandler Bing,"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
Chandler Bing,Hey! How'd the interview go?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house."
Chandler Bing,"Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas."
Chandler Bing,It's like 'Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.'
Chandler Bing,"Sure, everybody loves a kidder."
Chandler Bing,Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Chandler Bing,I'm an alien. I'm an alien.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?"
Chandler Bing,I just saw Janice.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."
Chandler Bing,Hello-dillillio!!
Chandler Bing,Take off your shirt!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?"
Chandler Bing,Hi Joey's sisters!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer."
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have."
Chandler Bing,"Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
Chandler Bing,"Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'"
Chandler Bing,"Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part."
Chandler Bing,I can't remember which sister.
Chandler Bing,Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
Chandler Bing,"You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!"
Chandler Bing,"Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat."
Chandler Bing,"Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry."
Chandler Bing,"Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses."
Chandler Bing,It's gotta be the first one.
Chandler Bing,"Yep, I'm in a tree."
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba."
Chandler Bing,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Chandler Bing,"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?"
Chandler Bing,I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Chandler Bing,Where's Mary-Angela?
Chandler Bing,"This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?"
Chandler Bing,"So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?"
Chandler Bing,Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
Chandler Bing,So will I.
Chandler Bing,Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
Chandler Bing,Will you excuse me I have to um.....
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place."
Chandler Bing,"Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela."
Chandler Bing,"This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, this is soo bad."
Chandler Bing,No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
Chandler Bing,You're it! Now run and hide!
Chandler Bing,"I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?"
Chandler Bing,"Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, absolutely!"
Chandler Bing,You've got it.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Don't worry.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress."
Chandler Bing,"All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?"
Chandler Bing,"I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist."
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Chandler Bing,It must take you forever to find your keys.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, so can you make it on Friday?"
Chandler Bing,Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Chandler Bing,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
Chandler Bing,Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Chandler Bing,"I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer."
Chandler Bing,I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Chandler Bing,The abridgment.
Chandler Bing,....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh no, no, no, no."
Chandler Bing,"All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier."
Chandler Bing,"To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good."
Chandler Bing,Bye-bye.
Chandler Bing,"What, what, what?!"
Chandler Bing,You really think that is what he meant?
Chandler Bing,"Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you."
Chandler Bing,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
Chandler Bing,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
Chandler Bing,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?"
Chandler Bing,"And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?"
Chandler Bing,"Man, I gotta get a kid."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, baby!"
Chandler Bing,Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Chandler Bing,"Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hey."
Chandler Bing,"So ah, isn't a bit cold out for shorts?"
Chandler Bing,"Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames."
Chandler Bing,"I'm up! I'm up, I've gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay Ross, why don't you come with me?"
Chandler Bing,Robert's coming out.
Chandler Bing,No. He.....he's coming out of his shorts.
Chandler Bing,The man is showing brain.
Chandler Bing,Wellll?
Chandler Bing,What do we do? What do we do?
Chandler Bing,Like an eclipse.
Chandler Bing,"Your liking it, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"No, actually Laurie's a boy."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,You mean a three pointer?
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped."
Chandler Bing,"Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!"
Chandler Bing,"Hmmm, that's very cool."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe she cracked your code!
Chandler Bing,"No, Beth doesn't die, she doesn't die. Does she Rachel?"
Chandler Bing,"We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
Chandler Bing,I like her.
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people."
Chandler Bing,"All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish."
Chandler Bing,No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Chandler Bing,"Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, I'm-I'm talking to ah, . This is the part where you say your name."
Chandler Bing,"Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so...."
Chandler Bing,"Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom."
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's the best kiss I've had with anyone I've ever met in a men's room."
Chandler Bing,"Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
Chandler Bing,"No, really you're gonna freeze."
Chandler Bing,"You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."
Chandler Bing,"Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness."
Chandler Bing,"Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world."
Chandler Bing,Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Chandler Bing,It came up.
Chandler Bing,"No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
Chandler Bing,No. No. I don't think so.
Chandler Bing,That's-that's my nubbin.
Chandler Bing,"It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
Chandler Bing,"Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?"
Chandler Bing,"You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?"
Chandler Bing,Well hello!
Chandler Bing,The doctor.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting."
Chandler Bing,"That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, does anybody need anything copied? I'm going down to the Xerox place."
Chandler Bing,"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of."
Chandler Bing,Yeah! You wanna come?
Chandler Bing,Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Chandler Bing,Uh-oh.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, that hurt us."
Chandler Bing,"Well ah, ........y'know."
Chandler Bing,"All right, rock on."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?"
Chandler Bing,What time is it now?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah all right, so we'll hang out."
Chandler Bing,Yes. Vividly.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so..."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
Chandler Bing,She was kidding.
Chandler Bing,"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there...."
Chandler Bing,"Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
Chandler Bing,"Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you."
Chandler Bing,And that's the only colour that comes in.
Chandler Bing,"So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
Chandler Bing,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Chandler Bing,Why? What happened to him?
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?"
Chandler Bing,"He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her."
Chandler Bing,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!"
Chandler Bing,Off?!!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's mature."
Chandler Bing,"Nothing, nothing."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
Chandler Bing,"He has sex, and we get hit in our heads."
Chandler Bing,Uh-oh.
Chandler Bing,She was not good. Not good.
Chandler Bing,Uh-oh.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about."
Chandler Bing,"Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever."
Chandler Bing,"Oh great, food with hair on it."
Chandler Bing,Because that would be crazy?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Are you actually saying these words?
Chandler Bing,Let's go.
Chandler Bing,Is that your new walk?
Chandler Bing,This is the New York Times.
Chandler Bing,We are. He's meeting us here.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week."
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes, it's just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he's really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I'm, I'm smoking still."
Chandler Bing,"Look, I'm telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place."
Chandler Bing,"Yeahhh. I'm tellin' ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time...."
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's great, with my luck, that's gonna be him."
Chandler Bing,"Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, shut up!! You're not my real Mom!!"
Chandler Bing,Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Chandler Bing,"Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
Chandler Bing,Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Beam me up Jesus.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo."
Chandler Bing,"Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
Chandler Bing,My lighter's in there!
Chandler Bing,Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!
Chandler Bing,"Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning."
Chandler Bing,"Ladies, ladies, let's just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica's bra."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass."
Chandler Bing,At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Chandler Bing,I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Chandler Bing,Well it's very unsettling.
Chandler Bing,Hey!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh no, now it's not gonna make any sense!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible."
Chandler Bing,"No, I wasn't gonna ask you that, no."
Chandler Bing,It's horrible.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, I can handle it, handle's my middle name. Actually it's the ah, middle part of my first name."
Chandler Bing,"Guys, guys, guess who I am?!"
Chandler Bing,I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Chandler Bing,Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"No-no, why don't you hang on to that one."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, that's like the least fun game ever."
Chandler Bing,"Oh. Nope, that patch is no good."
Chandler Bing,Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married."
Chandler Bing,Always illegal Joe.
Chandler Bing,"If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?"
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, pretty good."
Chandler Bing,"Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse."
Chandler Bing,Thanks
Chandler Bing,What check thing?
Chandler Bing,Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
Chandler Bing,Who's he huggin'?
Chandler Bing,This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Chandler Bing,There you go!!
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, then get the lobster!"
Chandler Bing,"Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately."
Chandler Bing,Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Chandler Bing,Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive."
Chandler Bing,"If I broke up with you, I'd miss you."
Chandler Bing,And you're our age. You're our age.
Chandler Bing,That's not a state Joe.
Chandler Bing,You're our age!
Chandler Bing,"I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter, I still wind up with this little cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying. Does it bug you?"
Chandler Bing,Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Chandler Bing,Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
Chandler Bing,You didn't just break up.
Chandler Bing,You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Chandler Bing,Stop what?!
Chandler Bing,No!! You can't!!
Chandler Bing,"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!"
Chandler Bing,Look man!
Chandler Bing,Listen to me!!
Chandler Bing,"She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Chandler Bing,"I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
Chandler Bing,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
Chandler Bing,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Chandler Bing,"I'm talking about you. You big, big freak."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
Chandler Bing,'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Chandler Bing,"No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man."
Chandler Bing,"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
Chandler Bing,What about things that are already gold?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, let's play my game now."
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!"
Chandler Bing,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I realise that."
Chandler Bing,That's the stuff!
Chandler Bing,"Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you."
Chandler Bing,Hello.
Chandler Bing,And is this in case the house sneezes?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
Chandler Bing,"Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, my Father's house does that!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
Chandler Bing,"Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'"
Chandler Bing,That's what you say at the end of a date.
Chandler Bing,"To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion."
Chandler Bing,"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well give me the phone then."
Chandler Bing,"Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'"
Chandler Bing,Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Chandler Bing,"All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
Chandler Bing,"That's just a lot of big talk, y'know."
Chandler Bing,"It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
Chandler Bing,"The food there was, was great."
Chandler Bing,So take care.
Chandler Bing,"Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime."
Chandler Bing,Noo!
Chandler Bing,"Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
Chandler Bing,Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, o-okay."
Chandler Bing,Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,No way!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! Who's gonna watch that?!
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,"So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Okay. It's a chicken.
Chandler Bing,Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Chandler Bing,Easy Lenny.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,She?
Chandler Bing,"I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly."
Chandler Bing,Excuse me?
Chandler Bing,I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Chandler Bing,You don't think I get up when you get up?
Chandler Bing,"Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!"
Chandler Bing,And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
Chandler Bing,"I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?"
Chandler Bing,I'll take her back tomorrow.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!"
Chandler Bing,"I know. See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth, she's a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?"
Chandler Bing,"If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!"
Chandler Bing,Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Chandler Bing,"Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way."
Chandler Bing,"Ohhh-hoo, funny story!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!"
Chandler Bing,"That's a bad duck!!! How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!"
Chandler Bing,What did you do?
Chandler Bing,Having a swim.
Chandler Bing,Chicks don't swim.
Chandler Bing,I don't know. Should we try it?
Chandler Bing,"See, I told you they don't swim."
Chandler Bing,"Noo! Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby, baby, baby."
Chandler Bing,Ye-e-es!!
Chandler Bing,I had one.
Chandler Bing,Who's number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Chandler Bing,Bye!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and I don't have any cologne."
Chandler Bing,Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Chandler Bing,Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
Chandler Bing,Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
Chandler Bing,There he is!
Chandler Bing,Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,So that's the girl you like.
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don't like the guy Rachel's dating? Well, that's odd."
Chandler Bing,Could I borrow it?
Chandler Bing,Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Chandler Bing,7:15. Watch doesn't work.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, banging his hands together!"
Chandler Bing,"Ross, don't. Ross!"
Chandler Bing,"Ohh, that's a good one."
Chandler Bing,"Why don't you use ours across the hall, 'cause she...has...problems."
Chandler Bing,Step away from the duck.
Chandler Bing,"And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone."
Chandler Bing,Or... Dick.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Was it like a sneeze only better?
Chandler Bing,Whoa!!!
Chandler Bing,No!!
Chandler Bing,Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
Chandler Bing,"No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a..."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred."
Chandler Bing,"You're right, I know."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
Chandler Bing,"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean."
Chandler Bing,"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
Chandler Bing,I-kea! This is comfortable.
Chandler Bing,"So, what do you thing the good news is?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?"
Chandler Bing,"Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says ""You're in Sample."""
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are ""There are no rules."""
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office."
Chandler Bing,"Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah..."
Chandler Bing,"All right buddy, way to go!"
Chandler Bing,"Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em."
Chandler Bing,What if Joey were president?
Chandler Bing,What is with him?
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once."
Chandler Bing,No sir.
Chandler Bing,Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Chandler Bing,"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
Chandler Bing,"Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!"
Chandler Bing,"No, I ah, I didn't do them."
Chandler Bing,"No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise."
Chandler Bing,Doug!!
Chandler Bing,I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Chandler Bing,"No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Ahhhhh!
Chandler Bing,"Thank you, sir."
Chandler Bing,"No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous."
Chandler Bing,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
Chandler Bing,"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
Chandler Bing,"So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!"
Chandler Bing,Tell it again. Seriously.
Chandler Bing,"Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965."
Chandler Bing,"You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
Chandler Bing,"Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend."
Chandler Bing,Why is that so funny?
Chandler Bing,"Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like ""Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey."""
Chandler Bing,Hey!!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can't have children!!"
Chandler Bing,"Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?"
Chandler Bing,Big bullies!!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Bored and bored!
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker."
Chandler Bing,"So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?"
Chandler Bing,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, lucky for you."
Chandler Bing,I don't know.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house."
Chandler Bing,Where ya going?
Chandler Bing,"Noo!! I don't care! I'm not, I'm not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!"
Chandler Bing,G'night.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......"
Chandler Bing,Ahhhh!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M."
Chandler Bing,There is not one hair on that head.
Chandler Bing,Hi there.
Chandler Bing,"Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!"
Chandler Bing,"Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'll go out and get you some."
Chandler Bing,"Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go?"
Chandler Bing,I found a dried up seashores.
Chandler Bing,"All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?"
Chandler Bing,I've got canned goods.
Chandler Bing,"Excellent hole, Joe."
Chandler Bing,"Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!"
Chandler Bing,We've got to do something!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain."
Chandler Bing,Me too!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!"
Chandler Bing,"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
Chandler Bing,Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Chandler Bing,I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Chandler Bing,NO!!!
Chandler Bing,They'll never understand!
Chandler Bing,We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn't think we could make it.
Chandler Bing,And then Joey remembered something.
Chandler Bing,"Joey kept screaming at me, ""Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!"" Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming."
Chandler Bing,Coffee house?
Chandler Bing,I KNEW IT!!!!
Chandler Bing,"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Chandler Bing,Okay. All right.
Chandler Bing,"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Chandler Bing,Okay. All right.
Chandler Bing,Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Chandler Bing,"You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it."
Chandler Bing,Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Chandler Bing,"Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land."
Chandler Bing,"Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship."
Chandler Bing,You want it?
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?"
Chandler Bing,"All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
Chandler Bing,Nooo.
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Chandler Bing,Let it go!!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
Chandler Bing,"You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe."
Chandler Bing,"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong."
Chandler Bing,"Oh-no, he's right."
Chandler Bing,I'm coming already!!
Chandler Bing,OH MY GOD!!!
Chandler Bing,Are you all right?!
Chandler Bing,What happened?!!
Chandler Bing,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Chandler Bing,So-You got in voluntarily?!
Chandler Bing,BEND OVER?!!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, they said uh, ""You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."""
Chandler Bing,That's a good call. Right.
Chandler Bing,"Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!"
Chandler Bing,Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Chandler Bing,Could we be more white trash?
Chandler Bing,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday."
Chandler Bing,"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink."
Chandler Bing,No. No!
Chandler Bing,"Well, not at first."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I promise, I'll end it."
Chandler Bing,"I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, I totally agree."
Chandler Bing,...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
Chandler Bing,It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,I'm getting dressed.
Chandler Bing,When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Chandler Bing,What is it?
Chandler Bing,"Ah-ha, you're not the boss of me. Yeah, you are! Ooh, saucy."
Chandler Bing,"You are, you're gonna leave me like this?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay. But if you don't come back soon, there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!"
Chandler Bing,Hi! How are you?
Chandler Bing,"Hello, Joanna......'s office."
Chandler Bing,How little?!
Chandler Bing,"Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!"
Chandler Bing,Why not?!
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"Rachel, could I see you for a moment?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, here's the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit."
Chandler Bing,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!"
Chandler Bing,"It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out."
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can't get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and"
Chandler Bing,Never!
Chandler Bing,Fine!
Chandler Bing,I-never borrowed your Walkman.
Chandler Bing,You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! Ahhh!
Chandler Bing,"No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. Hello sweet pants!"
Chandler Bing,About what?
Chandler Bing,"I'll make something up! I'm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh-ho-ho, I don't think so!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, this is much better."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go."
Chandler Bing,It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Chandler Bing,Freedom!
Chandler Bing,"Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!"
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,With extra pulp?
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,You don't have it.
Chandler Bing,How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Chandler Bing,Go on.
Chandler Bing,And Milton Berle has a...
Chandler Bing,Hello.
Chandler Bing,I love you.
Chandler Bing,"Two hours, that lasted!"
Chandler Bing,I think so.
Chandler Bing,Could there be more Kims?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times."
Chandler Bing,"You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria."
Chandler Bing,"Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat."
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Oh no, you'll have to come."
Chandler Bing,Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
Chandler Bing,Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
Chandler Bing,Yes. Yes!
Chandler Bing,No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Chandler Bing,Okay. I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler Bing,I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler Bing,I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler Bing,I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"No, I almost did, couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!"
Chandler Bing,"We're doomed. Okay, they're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,You're a genius!
Chandler Bing,"Now, there's two reasons."
Chandler Bing,"Thank you, Joey."
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"No, we'd just like to close them."
Chandler Bing,I wanna quit the bank!
Chandler Bing,To pay for the gym.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.
Chandler Bing,"Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty."
Chandler Bing,I could die.
Chandler Bing,I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?"
Chandler Bing,Wish me luck.
Chandler Bing,"Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?"
Chandler Bing,"Uh Kathy, with K or a C?"
Chandler Bing,Oh-oh-hey!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here."
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey."
Chandler Bing,"Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth."
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've..."
Chandler Bing,"So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class."
Chandler Bing,"That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him."
Chandler Bing,Is it on?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Oh! It's on! It's on!
Chandler Bing,There we go little fella.
Chandler Bing,Well the duck can swim.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty."
Chandler Bing,"She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?"
Chandler Bing,"No, I don't."
Chandler Bing,"Thank you, Ross."
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!"
Chandler Bing,Really?!
Chandler Bing,Right in there!
Chandler Bing,"99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week."
Chandler Bing,You-you do?
Chandler Bing,You got me.
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Right.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
Chandler Bing,Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, no-no thanks."
Chandler Bing,"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
Chandler Bing,I am pretending.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!"
Chandler Bing,Can I sleep on your couch?
Chandler Bing,Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Chandler Bing,"Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
Chandler Bing,Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Chandler Bing,"Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I have a call in about that."
Chandler Bing,"Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
Chandler Bing,It doesn't say that. Does it?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great."
Chandler Bing,"It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?"
Chandler Bing,Sure...
Chandler Bing,"I don't know... um, Grease?"
Chandler Bing,Rent?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so when do you want to go?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, it is, at Office Max."
Chandler Bing,A pen.
Chandler Bing,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Chandler Bing,Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Chandler Bing,"All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?"
Chandler Bing,For three years?
Chandler Bing,"All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?"
Chandler Bing,Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy."" Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?"
Chandler Bing,"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her."
Chandler Bing,Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Chandler Bing,Where?
Chandler Bing,I got something for her. It's a book!
Chandler Bing,"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?"
Chandler Bing,"No, it came out to an even twenty."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?"
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah? That's great!
Chandler Bing,Aahhuuhhh....
Chandler Bing,Hey! Happy birthday.
Chandler Bing,No he didn't.
Chandler Bing,Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing,"See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah... yeah."
Chandler Bing,Goodnight.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, the book?"
Chandler Bing,What do you mean?
Chandler Bing,"Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, ""Uhl, ell."""
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend."
Chandler Bing,Goodnight.
Chandler Bing,I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Chandler Bing,"It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!"
Chandler Bing,Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Chandler Bing,"Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
Chandler Bing,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you."
Chandler Bing,"All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
Chandler Bing,"All right! Bring it on, you..."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! Play!
Chandler Bing,"Really, bitchin'!"
Chandler Bing,"You mean like, music?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy."
Chandler Bing,Come in!
Chandler Bing,"Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles."
Chandler Bing,"No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?"
Chandler Bing,I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.
Chandler Bing,What happened?
Chandler Bing,Why can't you tell her?
Chandler Bing,Joey! Joey!!
Chandler Bing,I thought your time ran out.
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry."
Chandler Bing,"So I guess it's just uh, you and me then."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I think it is!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut..."
Chandler Bing,...and then it got canceled.
Chandler Bing,Really?! You do that?
Chandler Bing,"Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy."
Chandler Bing,"Well, thanks. I grow it myself. Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!"
Chandler Bing,What-what 'cha doin'?
Chandler Bing,'Kay.
Chandler Bing,Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!
Chandler Bing,Hey it's Joey!
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah man. Joey.
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!"
Chandler Bing,"Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?"
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,"Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?"
Chandler Bing,"I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him."
Chandler Bing,"Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn."
Chandler Bing,I-I think we have too.
Chandler Bing,Bye. Are you still out there?
Chandler Bing,Hang on buddy!
Chandler Bing,I sure did.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
Chandler Bing,Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Chandler Bing,"Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I don't know."
Chandler Bing,You mean with Casey.
Chandler Bing,Or Casey.
Chandler Bing,Could be Casey.
Chandler Bing,Consider Casey.
Chandler Bing,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Chandler Bing,I kissed Kathy.
Chandler Bing,"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?"
Chandler Bing,Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Chandler Bing,God!! What am I gonna do?!
Chandler Bing,Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Is that a real thing?
Chandler Bing,"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
Chandler Bing,"It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Oh uh, when?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
Chandler Bing,"See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is."
Chandler Bing,It's me. I'm the other guy.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and..."
Chandler Bing,No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Chandler Bing,How is that worse?!
Chandler Bing,"Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!"
Chandler Bing,"You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
Chandler Bing,Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Chandler Bing,Probably because...
Chandler Bing,"Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I..."
Chandler Bing,"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm..."
Chandler Bing,"Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!"
Chandler Bing,"They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her."
Chandler Bing,Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials..."
Chandler Bing,"Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!"
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
Chandler Bing,Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Chandler Bing,He's really picky about his patients.
Chandler Bing,"All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it."
Chandler Bing,"Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
Chandler Bing,"I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
Chandler Bing,Like?
Chandler Bing,When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Chandler Bing,Big dog?
Chandler Bing,"I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words."
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe.
Chandler Bing,Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
Chandler Bing,"All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?"
Chandler Bing,Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Chandler Bing,"The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!"
Chandler Bing,Air hole! Air hole!!
Chandler Bing,How do ya do.
Chandler Bing,What happened? What happened?!
Chandler Bing,Gotcha!
Chandler Bing,Sorry!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, you got it!"
Chandler Bing,"You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!"
Chandler Bing,"You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight."
Chandler Bing,Absolutely!
Chandler Bing,So?
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,"Man, this is..."
Chandler Bing,Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?"
Chandler Bing,"No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!"
Chandler Bing,"Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!"
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Chandler Bing,"This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!"
Chandler Bing,Woooo!!!
Chandler Bing,Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Chandler Bing,"Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there."
Chandler Bing,It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Chandler Bing,Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Chandler Bing,Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Chandler Bing,"Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then."
Chandler Bing,"He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago."
Chandler Bing,"Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players."
Chandler Bing,"Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!"
Chandler Bing,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Chandler Bing,All right!!
Chandler Bing,"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, those were seals, man."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, all right."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Actually, me too."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?"
Chandler Bing,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Chandler Bing,How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight."
Chandler Bing,"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it."
Chandler Bing,Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
Chandler Bing,Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss."
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!"
Chandler Bing,"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!"
Chandler Bing,"Hello, children!"
Chandler Bing,Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?"
Chandler Bing,Wherever! I've got like 20!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, I'm gonna uh, play the field just a little more."
Chandler Bing,Guys are signing over their 401-K's to me?
Chandler Bing,"Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him, he's really nice, he's funny, he's a swimmer."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards."
Chandler Bing,"See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
Chandler Bing,"It's a big company, I don't-if you-I..."
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah! With who?
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, man!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, like father, like son."
Chandler Bing,Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Chandler Bing,"Ummmmmmmm, no."
Chandler Bing,Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?"
Chandler Bing,"I'm not Jewish, so..."
Chandler Bing,Bad dream?
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?"
Chandler Bing,Prague?
Chandler Bing,I did! I absolutely did!
Chandler Bing,"I'm sure you're right, but why?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry."
Chandler Bing,I know! I know!
Chandler Bing,"Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth."
Chandler Bing,Have you ever been with a woman?
Chandler Bing,So there is no good time to ask that question.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
Chandler Bing,Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you-you know what I meant."
Chandler Bing,So what job did you get Joe?
Chandler Bing,Great!! That's great!
Chandler Bing,You're gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, sure, it's not mine anyway. It can with the pants."
Chandler Bing,Yes. Right where?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking."
Chandler Bing,"All right, we haven't had sex yet. Okay, what's the big deal? Y'know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level."
Chandler Bing,"No, he's right, I'm totally lying."
Chandler Bing,"Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey."
Chandler Bing,"No, I'm afraid I won't be able to make love as well as him."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
Chandler Bing,"We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,"All right, all right, I'll go sleep with my girlfriend. But I'm just doing it for you guys."
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes, we had the sex."
Chandler Bing,"It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, I'm all right with it."""
Chandler Bing,"Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"""
Chandler Bing,"Look, you don't have to draw an actual wo-whoa! She's hot!"
Chandler Bing,There are seven?!
Chandler Bing,That's one?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down."
Chandler Bing,That-that's bad?
Chandler Bing,Well you might if it were anything like 7!
Chandler Bing,You!
Chandler Bing,Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I can uh, check that for ya."
Chandler Bing,I can check that for ya.
Chandler Bing,Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Chandler Bing,"And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag."
Chandler Bing,Stop that now!
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,Diet soda.
Chandler Bing,Orange juice.
Chandler Bing,"Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!"
Chandler Bing,I got it! Scotch... tape.
Chandler Bing,"Well, we used there's up last night making scary faces."
Chandler Bing,All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
Chandler Bing,Fears and Pet Peeves.
Chandler Bing,His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
Chandler Bing,She has a real name.
Chandler Bing,Althea?! What are you doing?!
Chandler Bing,You're shooting with Althea?!
Chandler Bing,Nice shooting!
Chandler Bing,"Actually, it's Miss Chinandolor Bong."
Chandler Bing,Unfortunately that is correct.
Chandler Bing,"I majored in lightning rounds. All right, we're gonna destroy you."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far..."
Chandler Bing,Say 200?
Chandler Bing,"All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds."
Chandler Bing,"But if we win, we get your apartment."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Dangerous Liaisons.
Chandler Bing,Oh!
Chandler Bing,Fancy.
Chandler Bing,Fancy guest.
Chandler Bing,Thanks man.
Chandler Bing,YEAH!!! YES!!!
Chandler Bing,You can't just call Monica's room.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but I bet it works."
Chandler Bing,Well believe it baby!
Chandler Bing,I knew it!
Chandler Bing,"Cool, girl roommate."
Chandler Bing,Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Chandler Bing,What?! What-what is it?!
Chandler Bing,I can't believe we live here!
Chandler Bing,Awwwww!! Awwwwwww!!!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!"
Chandler Bing,I know!!
Chandler Bing,Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
Chandler Bing,"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, ""So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?"" And she'll go, ""No-no-no, it's Chandler."" And he'll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
Chandler Bing,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know but..."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing."
Chandler Bing,"I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!"
Chandler Bing,"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him."
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing."
Chandler Bing,"Well, you can understand, given how we started."
Chandler Bing,"Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!"
Chandler Bing,Steps! Slut! You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Chandler Bing,"I confronted her, and she didn't deny it! I don't live here!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie's..."
Chandler Bing,Yes! See you and I have always been like-
Chandler Bing,Did she call?
Chandler Bing,"All right, maybe I should call her."
Chandler Bing,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
Chandler Bing,"Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?"
Chandler Bing,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!"
Chandler Bing,"That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!!
Chandler Bing,"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, she wasn't sleeping with him."
Chandler Bing,She is now.
Chandler Bing,"I'm saying that she... is a devil woman! Y'know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don't hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really."
Chandler Bing,"Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!"
Chandler Bing,"You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you."
Chandler Bing,Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I can't believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I'm never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!"
Chandler Bing,That's right! Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Chandler Bing,They got a breakfast buffet.
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, let me talk to him!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, can I just..."
Chandler Bing,She's shhing me! It's my phone and she's shhing me!
Chandler Bing,Ow!
Chandler Bing,"Maybe, she doesn't hit him all the time."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'm going to go stand over there."
Chandler Bing,"So y'know, uh, when's he getting back?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I knew something like this was going to happen."
Chandler Bing,"Yes you can. You're thinking about time, you can't go back in time."
Chandler Bing,No you can't.
Chandler Bing,"You don't want to be guys, you'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"No thanks, Mom!"
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, come on! Y'know what-y'know what, I think I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy."
Chandler Bing,"No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I'm gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, I'm gonna get so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice"
Chandler Bing,Ohhh!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, well I'm gonna put my sweats back on."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Stripping!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave."
Chandler Bing,"Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn't picture myself with any of them."
Chandler Bing,Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Chandler Bing,I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm there too!"
Chandler Bing,Stop it! You're killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Chandler Bing,Where I don't want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Chandler Bing,"Come on, let me see that smile."
Chandler Bing,Please?
Chandler Bing,"I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
Chandler Bing,"All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, ""Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"""
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
Chandler Bing,"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!"
Chandler Bing,"What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!"
Chandler Bing,That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
Chandler Bing,Hello!
Chandler Bing,Isn't this amazing?
Chandler Bing,Okay. Bye.
Chandler Bing,Bye.
Chandler Bing,Bye.
Chandler Bing,B-bye!
Chandler Bing,Bye. I can't stand the woman!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality-Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!"
Chandler Bing,Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship..."
Chandler Bing,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Chandler Bing,"I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
Chandler Bing,"No! No! Not, Paris."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!"
Chandler Bing,I don't know exactly.
Chandler Bing,But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow."
Chandler Bing,"I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her."
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!"
Chandler Bing,Thanks!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport."
Chandler Bing,"Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then."
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
Chandler Bing,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Chandler Bing,"No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card."
Chandler Bing,American Express?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
Chandler Bing,"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
Chandler Bing,Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Chandler Bing,What are you writing?
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?"
Chandler Bing,Hi guys!
Chandler Bing,Without me?!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it."
Chandler Bing,Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
Chandler Bing,What are you talking about?
Chandler Bing,Surprise!!
Chandler Bing,Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
Chandler Bing,Like what?
Chandler Bing,"I said, ""Like what?"""
Chandler Bing,Does for me.
Chandler Bing,Flashdance.
Chandler Bing,She was a welder.
Chandler Bing,What are the odds? What are the odds?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh-ho, yeah!"
Chandler Bing,Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Do we pay for this?
Chandler Bing,Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!"
Chandler Bing,Like finding money with naked people on it!
Chandler Bing,Oh no-no-no-no!
Chandler Bing,We don't know what could make this go away.
Chandler Bing,And no one touches the air around the TV!
Chandler Bing,Oh no-no-no!
Chandler Bing,We still have porn.
Chandler Bing,Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Chandler Bing,It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
Chandler Bing,"Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?"
Chandler Bing,They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Chandler Bing,"Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?"
Chandler Bing,"All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Okay. Good one.
Chandler Bing,"Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
Chandler Bing,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Chandler Bing,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Chandler Bing,What's the second part of your plan?
Chandler Bing,You put your fist through the wall?
Chandler Bing,A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Chandler Bing,Are we in London?
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
Chandler Bing,"What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn."
Chandler Bing,"All right, ready?"
Chandler Bing,Two.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that's kinda a relief."
Chandler Bing,You wanna see if we still have it?
Chandler Bing,FREE PORN!!!
Chandler Bing,We have free porn here!!!
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum."
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Chandler Bing,Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Chandler Bing,"Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him."
Chandler Bing,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,And now you're giving me the message!
Chandler Bing,You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Chandler Bing,Hi! Hi! You're crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Chandler Bing,Raymond Chandler.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
Chandler Bing,I have no name.
Chandler Bing,"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
Chandler Bing,It's Clint. It's Clint!
Chandler Bing,It's Clint! Clint!
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
Chandler Bing,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
Chandler Bing,Really?!
Chandler Bing,Okay. Thanks.
Chandler Bing,You wanna hug it out?
Chandler Bing,Yay!
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,"Bye, Pheebs!"
Chandler Bing,Ha! Ha! Ha!
Chandler Bing,Ho! Ho! Ho!
Chandler Bing,Your pants!
Chandler Bing,Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, a T-shirt that says, ""I don't belong here."""
Chandler Bing,Yeah we do!
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?
Chandler Bing,"Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!"
Chandler Bing,"No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?"
Chandler Bing,"Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,You do know that Wham broke up?
Chandler Bing,Where is Emily?
Chandler Bing,"Man, didn't she like just get here?"
Chandler Bing,Easy tiger.
Chandler Bing,So what are you going to do?
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?
Chandler Bing,"Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!"
Chandler Bing,"And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go."
Chandler Bing,No thank you.
Chandler Bing,"Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?"
Chandler Bing,"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats."
Chandler Bing,Screw the Knicks!
Chandler Bing,I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Chandler Bing,And the Knicks rule all.
Chandler Bing,"No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade."
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Op, op, I'm convinced!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in."
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,"Fine, let's do it."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first"
Chandler Bing,That's a low one!
Chandler Bing,Why are you screaming and hugging?
Chandler Bing,Yeah baby!
Chandler Bing,Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
Chandler Bing,No they didn't!
Chandler Bing,Those were like the best seats ever.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small."
Chandler Bing,"Oh. Oh, God!"
Chandler Bing,I KNOW!!!
Chandler Bing,Open up! Open up! Open up!
Chandler Bing,What the hell is going on?!
Chandler Bing,"We are switching back, right now!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!"
Chandler Bing,Totally worth it!
Chandler Bing,Good night.
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well, that's great!"
Chandler Bing,Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?"
Chandler Bing,"Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? So uh, what do you do when you're not working here?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay, thanks."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!"
Chandler Bing,"It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!"
Chandler Bing,They don't have those.
Chandler Bing,"Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, all right!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, she's got you running errands, y'know, picking up wedding dresses... Wah-pah!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!"
Chandler Bing,That's what I did. Wah-pah!
Chandler Bing,"All right buddy, time to roll over. No-no! No, no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!"
Chandler Bing,It's 6:00.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings."
Chandler Bing,"Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this..."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Nothing.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Yes he did.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!"
Chandler Bing,You're coming on to the entire room! I'm Chandler.
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,You mind if I...
Chandler Bing,"So uh, what are you in for?"
Chandler Bing,"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep."
Chandler Bing,Hello! Little ones.
Chandler Bing,"Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
Chandler Bing,Because I'm cooler.
Chandler Bing,"Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious."
Chandler Bing,"Plus, you look cool."
Chandler Bing,Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe is, making people."
Chandler Bing,"And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!"
Chandler Bing,"No-no, not something stupid, something huge."
Chandler Bing,"Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!"
Chandler Bing,"We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!"
Chandler Bing,Yeah baby!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well..."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well..."
Chandler Bing,Yeeeeahhhh.
Chandler Bing,But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Chandler Bing,And I just want a million dollars!
Chandler Bing,Uh-oh.
Chandler Bing,She was not good. Not good.
Chandler Bing,Uh-oh.
Chandler Bing,Hello!
Chandler Bing,Noo.
Chandler Bing,I didn't know that.
Chandler Bing,"See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden."
Chandler Bing,"This isn't one of those uh, y'know ""If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?"" Right? Because I already bought my ticket..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's Ross's."
Chandler Bing,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
Chandler Bing,F-hah.... flennin....
Chandler Bing,Ohhh.
Chandler Bing,I KNEW IT!!!!
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
Chandler Bing,"All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! ""It's almost as good as being there."""
Chandler Bing,"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time."
Chandler Bing,"If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward."
Chandler Bing,You can be the best man when I get married.
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man."
Chandler Bing,"I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!"
Chandler Bing,I'm not even... I'm not even...
Chandler Bing,"Hey guys, what are you doing?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut."
Chandler Bing,See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Chandler Bing,"He just said, ""No strippers."""
Chandler Bing,"Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I've decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!"
Chandler Bing,Central Perk?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, a little announcement, I just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, so is the position of the bride."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!"
Chandler Bing,You slept with the stripper?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
Chandler Bing,"So you might say, it's a magic ring."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."""
Chandler Bing,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
Chandler Bing,You be cool.
Chandler Bing,"Way to be cool, man."
Chandler Bing,Marry me.
Chandler Bing,"He will, Joe."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, come on, it's not your fault."
Chandler Bing,"No, you should."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Thanks man.
Chandler Bing,What a baby.
Chandler Bing,Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Chandler Bing,"Condoms, dude!"
Chandler Bing,Don't read my condoms!
Chandler Bing,You got your passport?
Chandler Bing,There it is.
Chandler Bing,All right! Let's do it!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know what? I was wrong."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Chandler Bing,"I am, I'm ignoring you."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, what the hell is that?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?"
Chandler Bing,"I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place."
Chandler Bing,To Put the Camera Away!!!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
Chandler Bing,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?"
Chandler Bing,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
Chandler Bing,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Chandler Bing,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, this is just as boring in England."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,That's... That's was...
Chandler Bing,How did you? How? How?
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Chandler Bing,That was pretty intense huh?
Chandler Bing,I hope he did!
Chandler Bing,"Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself."
Chandler Bing,"I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God.."
Chandler Bing,"And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily."
Chandler Bing,Out loud?
Chandler Bing,So how are you doing?
Chandler Bing,"The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother."
Chandler Bing,Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?"
Chandler Bing,"Morning, Ross."
Chandler Bing,Yeah you are!!
Chandler Bing,Well I've-I've never done that with you before.
Chandler Bing,"So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yea yea, absolutely."
Chandler Bing,I don't want to look.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,I'm not seeing Monica.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Oh my god!
Chandler Bing,No!! Okay!! What's with the third degree?! Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yea, your right. It's the second one."
Chandler Bing,What we did last night was....
Chandler Bing,Totally crazy stupid.
Chandler Bing,"I'm coming over tonight though, right?"
Chandler Bing,"It could've been worse, he could've shot her."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."
Chandler Bing,Seven times!
Chandler Bing,"In a foreign, romantic country..."
Chandler Bing,Bad London!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs..."
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,"Forget it, that's off."
Chandler Bing,The man's got a point.
Chandler Bing,"Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee!"" just ignore me."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hello Rachel."
Chandler Bing,Your sister Joan is crazy.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, we do. But, we have to change first."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yay..."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?"
Chandler Bing,"Wow, you look..."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I've got a girl in here."
Chandler Bing,"Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it."
Chandler Bing,"Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser."
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,"Nope, not under here!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it's a very large plane."
Chandler Bing,"But, we'll stay here with you."
Chandler Bing,We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Chandler Bing,"We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters."
Chandler Bing,'Kay!
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, no."
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,Okay man.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,No we didn't!
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule."
Chandler Bing,Right.
Chandler Bing,"Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?"
Chandler Bing,And I'm cute too.
Chandler Bing,"Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack."
Chandler Bing,Bye.
Chandler Bing,"I'm still on London time, does that count?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good!"
Chandler Bing,"It could've been worse, he could've shot her."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."

Chandler Bing,"Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule."

Chandler Bing,Bye.
Chandler Bing,"I'm still on London time, does that count?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good!"
Chandler Bing,"Ehh, you're just liquored up."
Chandler Bing,"I've had a very long, hard day."
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
Chandler Bing,"For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!"
Chandler Bing,"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken."
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Pheebs!"
Chandler Bing,"Uh, The Wheatsheaf."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe she can out run you man!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY."
Chandler Bing,Oh that's not true.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I gotta go to work."
Chandler Bing,"And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back."
Chandler Bing,Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
Chandler Bing,"All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?"
Chandler Bing,"I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
Chandler Bing,"So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea."
Chandler Bing,I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Pheebs!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"
Chandler Bing,Atlantic City!
Chandler Bing,Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Chandler Bing,"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,That's right.
Chandler Bing,Oh no.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Hey! You okay?
Chandler Bing,"Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?"
Chandler Bing,All right...
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing."
Chandler Bing,Really? Male nurses?
Chandler Bing,So they're going on dates? When?
Chandler Bing,"This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?"
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
Chandler Bing,Fine! Maybe I will too!
Chandler Bing,"So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,"Sure. And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?"
Chandler Bing,All right. Very good.
Chandler Bing,"Bye, momi-moo."
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,"Oh God, kindergarten flashback."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, keep saying it!"
Chandler Bing,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this."
Chandler Bing,"Really? Okay, so..."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Chandler Bing,Right!
Chandler Bing,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
Chandler Bing,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
Chandler Bing,Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!"
Chandler Bing,Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
Chandler Bing,Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
Chandler Bing,"Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!"
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?"
Chandler Bing,"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
Chandler Bing,"Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this."
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends."
Chandler Bing,That's true!
Chandler Bing,That's true!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, there he is! There he is!"
Chandler Bing,"How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
Chandler Bing,"Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves."
Chandler Bing,"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,What's your point?
Chandler Bing,"Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best."
Chandler Bing,"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD."
Chandler Bing,"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
Chandler Bing,"All right, let's show them how it's done."
Chandler Bing,Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Chandler Bing,Nope.
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, 9."
Chandler Bing,"I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go."
Chandler Bing,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,"Uh, hey!"
Chandler Bing,We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Chandler Bing,"Aww, man!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?"""
Chandler Bing,Condoms?
Chandler Bing,And condoms are the way to do that?
Chandler Bing,I can't believe it! We're here!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, great."
Chandler Bing,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Chandler Bing,What? Why?
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you."
Chandler Bing,Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
Chandler Bing,Do not speak ill of the dead.
Chandler Bing,"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
Chandler Bing,"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
Chandler Bing,Damn Rollos!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?"
Chandler Bing,"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
Chandler Bing,Monica.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, fine, $300."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, me either."
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom."
Chandler Bing,"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Yes that was mine.
Chandler Bing,Yes that would have made more sense.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"So, I guess this is over."
Chandler Bing,"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
Chandler Bing,"Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
Chandler Bing,"So, this isn't over?"
Chandler Bing,Really? Okay. Great!
Chandler Bing,We're in a relationship?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Joey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Chandler Bing,Yes. Yes.
Chandler Bing,It happened in London.
Chandler Bing,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Chandler Bing,Fun's over!
Chandler Bing,Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Sorry.
Chandler Bing,Hello!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence..."
Chandler Bing,You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Chandler Bing,So you're really okay with this?
Chandler Bing,"Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?"
Chandler Bing,"So, rocks."
Chandler Bing,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
Chandler Bing,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
Chandler Bing,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?"
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Ross?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we are so sorry."
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, there-there she is!"
Chandler Bing,Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Chandler Bing,That's a pig.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!"
Chandler Bing,He thought you said gonad.
Chandler Bing,Love what you've done with the place.
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, the tears are real."
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,You built a fort didn't ya?
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was"
Chandler Bing,I hate this thing!
Chandler Bing,Hello children!
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Chandler Bing,You mean this.
Chandler Bing,"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so he's out of here."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?"
Chandler Bing,Not even on page 7?
Chandler Bing,What about that circled one?
Chandler Bing,"Yes, it is."
Chandler Bing,There we go!
Chandler Bing,Let's go quicker.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
Chandler Bing,It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Chandler Bing,We are bad people.
Chandler Bing,Yes that was a nice place!
Chandler Bing,"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!"
Chandler Bing,What are we gonna do?
Chandler Bing,About Ross!
Chandler Bing,"Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?"
Chandler Bing,Ohhhhh!
Chandler Bing,"98. 99. 100. Okay, go!"
Chandler Bing,Here we go! Here we go!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"You're kidding, no!"
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Ross, you have to stay!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, buddy!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?"
Chandler Bing,All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Chandler Bing,"That's sweet, Joey."
Chandler Bing,Are you aware that you're still talking?
Chandler Bing,No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Chandler Bing,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
Chandler Bing,"Really? Worse than, ""More turkey Mr. Chandler?"""
Chandler Bing,It's exactly like it sounds.
Chandler Bing,Arghhhhhh!!
Chandler Bing,I'm over here big guy.
Chandler Bing,You did look like an idiot.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef."
Chandler Bing,Emotional Knapsack?
Chandler Bing,"Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."
Chandler Bing,"Dude, don't do that too me!"
Chandler Bing,"No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister."
Chandler Bing,I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Chandler Bing,I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Chandler Bing,"I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry."
Chandler Bing,We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!"
Chandler Bing,Sorry!
Chandler Bing,Sorry.
Chandler Bing,"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Are you all right?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Chandler Bing,That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Chandler Bing,That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail."
Chandler Bing,I can't believe this.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, just leave me alone for a while."
Chandler Bing,"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" I'm happy all the time!"
Chandler Bing,Nice try.
Chandler Bing,"Look, Monica..."
Chandler Bing,This is not going to work.
Chandler Bing,You are so great! I love you!
Chandler Bing,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
Chandler Bing,No I didn't!
Chandler Bing,No I didn't!
Chandler Bing,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Chandler Bing,Top of the world? Dock of the bay? I'm out.
Chandler Bing,"Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!"
Chandler Bing,See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,All this lying has been hard on us too.
Chandler Bing,"Well, yeah actually."
Chandler Bing,"I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
Chandler Bing,Help!
Chandler Bing,"Hi, Pheebs!"
Chandler Bing,I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Chandler Bing,"Well, what did the police say?"
Chandler Bing,"Ross, it's just a sandwich!"
Chandler Bing,"Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?"
Chandler Bing,"Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?"
Chandler Bing,What is going on here?
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class."
Chandler Bing,Oh-I don't know.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,You're naked in this picture!
Chandler Bing,Ross?
Chandler Bing,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
Chandler Bing,And you're okay with that?
Chandler Bing,Oh no! No! No! No!
Chandler Bing,"All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this."
Chandler Bing,Joey's a sex addict.
Chandler Bing,Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Chandler Bing,Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Chandler Bing,"Hello, Chandler Bing."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!"
Chandler Bing,"Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!"
Chandler Bing,The British are coming?
Chandler Bing,Ohh.
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'll stop."
Chandler Bing,You wanna play?
Chandler Bing,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
Chandler Bing,I'm intrigued.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
Chandler Bing,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!"
Chandler Bing,"Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
Chandler Bing,"Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done."
Chandler Bing,"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
Chandler Bing,I paid for those tickets!
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah!
Chandler Bing,When did that happen to you?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, bye! Oh my God!!"
Chandler Bing,I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Chandler Bing,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?"
Chandler Bing,"Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!"
Chandler Bing,Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,What is up?
Chandler Bing,"No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted."
Chandler Bing,Could I be more sorry.
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry too.
Chandler Bing,"I am sorry, Ross."
Chandler Bing,This took you all day?!
Chandler Bing,We're very happy for you.
Chandler Bing,"We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know..."
Chandler Bing,Happy New Year!
Chandler Bing,"Do you want us to leave the room, or?"
Chandler Bing,"That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths."
Chandler Bing,"I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!"" And it starts right now!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Nice!
Chandler Bing,Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Chandler Bing,Horn-swoggle.
Chandler Bing,"No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before."
Chandler Bing,"What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular."
Chandler Bing,Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants!
Chandler Bing,"That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. Maybe there's something in that area."
Chandler Bing,Oh come on!!
Chandler Bing,Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. Yep."
Chandler Bing,"Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today, Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?!"
Chandler Bing,Sorry man.
Chandler Bing,Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party."
Chandler Bing,"I know, I can do this."
Chandler Bing,"I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, this is Monica. This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica."
Chandler Bing,"No, sir."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that was my work laugh."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Chandler Bing,"And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet."
Chandler Bing,"Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at...bigger rocks. Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, good luck with that."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game."
Chandler Bing,Let them win one.
Chandler Bing,You're not even giving them a chance!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win!"
Chandler Bing,"Oopsey, missed it!"
Chandler Bing,Long!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it."
Chandler Bing,It was my racquet.
Chandler Bing,If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Chandler Bing,"Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
Chandler Bing,Just a little bit of sugar.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you get used to it."
Chandler Bing,"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I just..."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,"I think I do! Thank you, Monica."
Chandler Bing,Coffee in a fight!
Chandler Bing,"All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!"
Chandler Bing,But we're not ready to tell yet!
Chandler Bing,"Man, she is really gullible."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Why would I be mad?
Chandler Bing,"I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you."
Chandler Bing,I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Chandler Bing,"And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down-let's write it down!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!"
Chandler Bing,It's your timer.
Chandler Bing,"All right, then massage me up right nice!"
Chandler Bing,Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Chandler Bing,It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Chandler Bing,Good-bye muscles!!
Chandler Bing,"I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!"
Chandler Bing,"Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
Chandler Bing,And the bunny got away.
Chandler Bing,And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Chandler Bing,Done.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Chandler Bing,Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,And a date with a man!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, he is!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, is Rachel here?"
Chandler Bing,"Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em."
Chandler Bing,I don't like your massages.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but now see you're crying!"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you give the worst massages in the world."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!"
Chandler Bing,Absolutely!
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,"Hey man, how did the audition go?"
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hey!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
Chandler Bing,And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Chandler Bing,Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Chandler Bing,Hello children!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. Are you okay?"
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything."
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny."
Chandler Bing,Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Chandler Bing,"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
Chandler Bing,I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Chandler Bing,Ow!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
Chandler Bing,"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!"
Chandler Bing,Well it's not flexed right now!
Chandler Bing,"Sure, I'll do it with ya."
Chandler Bing,That new mountain bike?
Chandler Bing,Your work makes me sad.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?
Chandler Bing,Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps-She knows!
Chandler Bing,Joey!
Chandler Bing,Phoebe knows about us!
Chandler Bing,Oh man!
Chandler Bing,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
Chandler Bing,"Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day."
Chandler Bing,"Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?"
Chandler Bing,How do you know?!
Chandler Bing,At this?!
Chandler Bing,Phoebe.
Chandler Bing,Come on in.
Chandler Bing,Sure.
Chandler Bing,Me? No. You?
Chandler Bing,So do I.
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna put on some music.
Chandler Bing,You look good.
Chandler Bing,"Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, do you not want to?"
Chandler Bing,Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Chandler Bing,"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!"
Chandler Bing,"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you're-you're going?"
Chandler Bing,"It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex."
Chandler Bing,Not if I kiss you first.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
Chandler Bing,Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Chandler Bing,Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Chandler Bing,"Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica."
Chandler Bing,And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
Chandler Bing,"Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm going on the lamb."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
Chandler Bing,"Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
Chandler Bing,Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps."
Chandler Bing,"Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up."
Chandler Bing,Sounds like a fun party.
Chandler Bing,"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head."
Chandler Bing,Wh-wh-why?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
Chandler Bing,"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?"
Chandler Bing,Hmm.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual."
Chandler Bing,"I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually."
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?"
Chandler Bing,Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Chandler Bing,"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
Chandler Bing,Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I did not know that."
Chandler Bing,"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable."
Chandler Bing,By me?
Chandler Bing,Monica.
Chandler Bing,Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
Chandler Bing,Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Chandler Bing,"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this."
Chandler Bing,Monica...
Chandler Bing,Will you marry me?
Chandler Bing,I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler Bing,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Chandler Bing,"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys."
Chandler Bing,I didn't think I was!
Chandler Bing,"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, how long is this going to go on."
Chandler Bing,That's not funny.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested."
Chandler Bing,"Hi, Joe."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!"
Chandler Bing,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.
Chandler Bing,"You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?"
Chandler Bing,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud."
Chandler Bing,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?"
Chandler Bing,Well there you have it!
Chandler Bing,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!"
Chandler Bing,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Chandler Bing,You think?!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?"
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, I do! I do! I do!"
Chandler Bing,Nice!
Chandler Bing,He has a gun!
Chandler Bing,"Hey Monica, here's your broom back."
Chandler Bing,"Oh hey, how'd the interview go?"
Chandler Bing,So what happened?
Chandler Bing,"Well you coulda tried, not kissing him."
Chandler Bing,"Come on, Rach."
Chandler Bing,I gotta check out this hot girl! There she is!
Chandler Bing,"So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you..."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, yeah."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,"Ohh, so?"
Chandler Bing,"Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat."
Chandler Bing,That was amazing!
Chandler Bing,That was amazing.
Chandler Bing,"No, you're the best."
Chandler Bing,"No, you're the best."
Chandler Bing,"Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee."
Chandler Bing,Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
Chandler Bing,"No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!"
Chandler Bing,"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!"
Chandler Bing,So?
Chandler Bing,Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Chandler Bing,Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Chandler Bing,"Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back."
Chandler Bing,You guys ready fore the movies?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Oh yes.
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,Hi there!
Chandler Bing,That.
Chandler Bing,"Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?"
Chandler Bing,"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
Chandler Bing,Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Chandler Bing,Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it is the best."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I wanna go to babe."
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Chandler Bing,"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water."
Chandler Bing,Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.
Chandler Bing,"Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!"
Chandler Bing,Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Chandler Bing,I wish I had smoked for my career...
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"
Chandler Bing,I think you smell great!
Chandler Bing,"Great job with the cups, Pheebs!"
Chandler Bing,Awesome!
Chandler Bing,There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
Chandler Bing,Thank you! Thank you!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, great."
Chandler Bing,I'll catch you guys later.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George."
Chandler Bing,"Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert."
Chandler Bing,Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay. Here you go."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, bye!"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,I was not flirting.
Chandler Bing,"Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all."
Chandler Bing,You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
Chandler Bing,I was not flirting.
Chandler Bing,"I was not and oh God, shh!"
Chandler Bing,Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Chandler Bing,"So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again."
Chandler Bing,"Happy Anniversary, 10 months!"
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there."
Chandler Bing,The one that doesn't.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?"
Chandler Bing,Here you go. Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Chandler Bing,You're welcome.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Thank you for that! I was not flirting.
Chandler Bing,Really?!
Chandler Bing,"So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, what is it?"
Chandler Bing,"If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?"
Chandler Bing,"Doesn't know, ""Hello."" But she knows Capricorn One."
Chandler Bing,"So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?"
Chandler Bing,"See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"""
Chandler Bing,It's true.
Chandler Bing,Again true.
Chandler Bing,All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. So, you're old and small."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, hold on. Okay."
Chandler Bing,"If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem."
Chandler Bing,Oh the humanity.
Chandler Bing,More so than anything else.
Chandler Bing,Almost over man.
Chandler Bing,Why am I looking?
Chandler Bing,You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Chandler Bing,Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown...engines...on!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,You ready?
Chandler Bing,You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Chandler Bing,Let me see the earrings.
Chandler Bing,They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Chandler Bing,Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Chandler Bing,"Hey man, what's up?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, yeah! Me too!"
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I like danger."
Chandler Bing,Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Chandler Bing,It is starting to get dark out there.
Chandler Bing,Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
Chandler Bing,Your tax dollars?
Chandler Bing,Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Chandler Bing,I can't smell your sandwich?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
Chandler Bing,How do you figure that?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
Chandler Bing,Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that."
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,"Uh, HELLO!!"
Chandler Bing,It was a car backfire!
Chandler Bing,Who jumps at loud noises!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever..."
Chandler Bing,"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk."
Chandler Bing,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Chandler Bing,I do not hate Ross!
Chandler Bing,What picture?
Chandler Bing,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
Chandler Bing,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line."
Chandler Bing,From a bullet!
Chandler Bing,Much sense?!
Chandler Bing,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
Chandler Bing,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
Chandler Bing,Really?!
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!"
Chandler Bing,Hm-hmm.
Chandler Bing,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Chandler Bing,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Chandler Bing,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Chandler Bing,"Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!"
Chandler Bing,"So, what are you gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,Me?! Why me?
Chandler Bing,"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."
Chandler Bing,"Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem."
Chandler Bing,Hey ladies! What are you in here for?
Chandler Bing,"Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
Chandler Bing,It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
Chandler Bing,You mean scared.
Chandler Bing,Scared? Happy?
Chandler Bing,"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
Chandler Bing,"Were you're parents happy, or something?"
Chandler Bing,"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you're right about that."
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"Yes I did, and I think you should do it."
Chandler Bing,"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady."
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him."
Chandler Bing,Hey Gar!
Chandler Bing,Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Chandler Bing,"All right, let me in."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,I'm not a dropper!
Chandler Bing,It's throwing and catching!
Chandler Bing,Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Chandler Bing,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
Chandler Bing,Not fun anymore?
Chandler Bing,"Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!"
Chandler Bing,Oh that is over!
Chandler Bing,You guys wanna eat here?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so Richard, Richard!"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,How much did I love The King and I?
Chandler Bing,You okay there man?
Chandler Bing,"Wow umm, calm down."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?"
Chandler Bing,You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I know that means buddy!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs."
Chandler Bing,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?"
Chandler Bing,"All right, great, road trip baby! This okay with you?"
Chandler Bing,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?"
Chandler Bing,"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
Chandler Bing,So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Chandler Bing,"All right, bye-bye now!"
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,"We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Isn't that Ross's money?
Chandler Bing,I don't know.
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,Too dry.
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,"I also said, ""Yes!"""
Chandler Bing,No! Ahhh!!!
Chandler Bing,"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
Chandler Bing,They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Chandler Bing,"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you don't want me on the trip?"
Chandler Bing,"All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie."
Chandler Bing,"All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!"
Chandler Bing,You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Chandler Bing,"All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Chandler Bing,"I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?"
Chandler Bing,Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?"
Chandler Bing,That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Is that Joey?! Let me talk to him!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!"
Chandler Bing,Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Chandler Bing,"Uh, what was that?"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Chandler Bing,Huh.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Wow!
Chandler Bing,Do we have to?
Chandler Bing,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I think we should see other people."
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,It's a great idea.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our anniversary."
Chandler Bing,Art lover!
Chandler Bing,I said art lover.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, I'm very tired."
Chandler Bing,So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
Chandler Bing,Happy plane-aversary.
Chandler Bing,Can I give you a present now?
Chandler Bing,Okay! Oh man! Don't tell me I did this!
Chandler Bing,"How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?"
Chandler Bing,Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Chandler Bing,What-what Richard thing?
Chandler Bing,What Richard thing?
Chandler Bing,I'm not mad.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God.
Chandler Bing,Love your condoms my man.
Chandler Bing,Why?! What happened?!
Chandler Bing,"No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody."
Chandler Bing,No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Chandler Bing,When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,Next time?
Chandler Bing,There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Chandler Bing,"That's so funny, because I think I just did!"
Chandler Bing,Fine with me!
Chandler Bing,What are you talking...
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,"Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary."
Chandler Bing,Whoa!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!"
Chandler Bing,Good luck!
Chandler Bing,I see.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,What's an identical hand twin?
Chandler Bing,Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Chandler Bing,How?
Chandler Bing,"Again I must go back to, how?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe."
Chandler Bing,"No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!"
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,That was Joey!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,See you later Mon.
Chandler Bing,What does it look like? I'm going home.
Chandler Bing,Come on! I was there! I know he's the love of your life.
Chandler Bing,Really?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing."
Chandler Bing,Hey Pheebs!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love."
Chandler Bing,Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?"
Chandler Bing,8. 8!
Chandler Bing,"If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!"
Chandler Bing,Noo!
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8."
Chandler Bing,Two fours.
Chandler Bing,"Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! Wait-wait-wait-wait! We get the biggest suite in the place."
Chandler Bing,Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Chandler Bing,Another hard 8.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; and we get married here tonight."
Chandler Bing,You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Chandler Bing,Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?"
Chandler Bing,Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Chandler Bing,Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Chandler Bing,All right!
Chandler Bing,Here it is! Here it is!
Chandler Bing,It's a four.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
Chandler Bing,Let's go!
Chandler Bing,"Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve."
Chandler Bing,I don't think so.
Chandler Bing,Here just...take this.
Chandler Bing,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, one thing at a time."
Chandler Bing,Hello! One marriage please!
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?"
Chandler Bing,Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Chandler Bing,Okay! This is it! We're gonna get married!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Yes! Well that-yes.
Chandler Bing,We actually missed it.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?"
Chandler Bing,It's a buffet man.
Chandler Bing,"Listen, I gotta talk to you."
Chandler Bing,Monica and I almost got married last night.
Chandler Bing,"Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?"
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or...
Chandler Bing,You did.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free."
Chandler Bing,I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Chandler Bing,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married."
Chandler Bing,Sounds great.
Chandler Bing,Ready!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, yes eight."
Chandler Bing,"That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess."
Chandler Bing,"That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?"
Chandler Bing,Well you did pull his hair.
Chandler Bing,I'm not getting into this again!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay."
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it."
Chandler Bing,Me too!
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
Chandler Bing,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Chandler Bing,Me asking is kind of a sign.
Chandler Bing,Okay!!!!!
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Oh thanks.
Chandler Bing,"The door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay! Ready?!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can't get in!"
Chandler Bing,This is not a sign!
Chandler Bing,It's an old key!
Chandler Bing,I love you!
Chandler Bing,Are you hugging the door right now.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah-yeah, me neither."
Chandler Bing,The key's stuck in the lock.
Chandler Bing,It still doesn't work.
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,Nice job Joe! You're quite the craftsmen.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
Chandler Bing,"No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too..."" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""...go to the bathroom."" He may think I'm sick."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?"
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,"No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man."
Chandler Bing,"Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,What gave me away?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?"
Chandler Bing,Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty..."
Chandler Bing,All yours babe.
Chandler Bing,Rach...
Chandler Bing,"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, Joey's my best friend."
Chandler Bing,You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Chandler Bing,Okay. Oh yes.
Chandler Bing,Hey-hey!
Chandler Bing,I am now!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, bye!"
Chandler Bing,"Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
Chandler Bing,Not once did we do that.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?"
Chandler Bing,And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?"
Chandler Bing,Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!
Chandler Bing,Who was it?
Chandler Bing,Sure!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."""
Chandler Bing,"So, that's it?"
Chandler Bing,Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!
Chandler Bing,"I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
Chandler Bing,"No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room."
Chandler Bing,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
Chandler Bing,"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women..."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Ohh.
Chandler Bing,That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Chandler Bing,We don't have to come up with this now.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair."
Chandler Bing,Is that a problem?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
Chandler Bing,In the game room!
Chandler Bing,All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!
Chandler Bing,You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.
Chandler Bing,Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Chandler Bing,"Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
Chandler Bing,That's laughter.
Chandler Bing,I don't know.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I do."
Chandler Bing,"He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm not so worried."
Chandler Bing,Of course!
Chandler Bing,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!
Chandler Bing,Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?"""
Chandler Bing,"Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!"
Chandler Bing,Really?!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, what's the matter?"
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you're gonna go?
Chandler Bing,Oh hi!
Chandler Bing,Why don't you open with a joke?
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not talking about Chuckles University?!"
Chandler Bing,That's the way I did it 'til I was 19.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild."
Chandler Bing,"""Benefits lapsed."""
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year."
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?"
Chandler Bing,What's wrong with you?
Chandler Bing,This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!
Chandler Bing,That's a hernia.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!"
Chandler Bing,I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!"
Chandler Bing,"Listen, I'm really glad you got the part."
Chandler Bing,But are you sure you can do this?
Chandler Bing,"Now, is that never talking about it again?!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why don't you uh, lift up your shirt? Take a look at this kiddo. We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!"
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, all right."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
Chandler Bing,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you're not married to anymore of us are ya?"
Chandler Bing,You left a shoe here?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, all right."
Chandler Bing,Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm gonna pass. 'Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies."
Chandler Bing,"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too."
Chandler Bing,See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Chandler Bing,"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around..."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Chandler Bing,What equity investments?
Chandler Bing,You don't even have a car!
Chandler Bing,And?
Chandler Bing,There you are.
Chandler Bing,"Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!"
Chandler Bing,He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Chandler Bing,"They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
Chandler Bing,"Glass, sand, whatever."
Chandler Bing,All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Chandler Bing,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat."
Chandler Bing,But you found the keys to his clothes?
Chandler Bing,That is true.
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me."
Chandler Bing,I think that's gum.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
Chandler Bing,And protected them from a tornado?
Chandler Bing,Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
Chandler Bing,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent."
Chandler Bing,First of the month.
Chandler Bing,"No, just the months you actually want to live here."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, here is the phone bill."
Chandler Bing,"That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?"
Chandler Bing,"It's not charity, Joe..."
Chandler Bing,"Okay uh, here's the electric bill."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, yeah."
Chandler Bing,"So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?"
Chandler Bing,"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it."
Chandler Bing,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride."
Chandler Bing,Well that would help the pride thing.
Chandler Bing,Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Chandler Bing,"Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing."
Chandler Bing,"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but for the last time."
Chandler Bing,He's at a dinner party.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
Chandler Bing,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
Chandler Bing,Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000."
Chandler Bing,Oh yes!
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
Chandler Bing,"See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking."
Chandler Bing,Still broken?
Chandler Bing,"Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun."
Chandler Bing,Cups.
Chandler Bing,"I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?"
Chandler Bing,"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?"
Chandler Bing,You're kidding right?
Chandler Bing,Well that's a full cup!
Chandler Bing,You win.
Chandler Bing,"It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?"
Chandler Bing,Not 700 exactly?
Chandler Bing,Double it!
Chandler Bing,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!"
Chandler Bing,What's wrong?
Chandler Bing,Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Chandler Bing,Oh man!!
Chandler Bing,"All right, let's play one more hand! One more!"
Chandler Bing,I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
Chandler Bing,"No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?"
Chandler Bing,When did I try to give you money?
Chandler Bing,I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,No problem roomie.
Chandler Bing,Sure!
Chandler Bing,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Chandler Bing,Exactly.
Chandler Bing,It's not a real game! I made it up!
Chandler Bing,At a fake game!!
Chandler Bing,Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Chandler Bing,"Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time."
Chandler Bing,And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you."
Chandler Bing,"So, uh, wh-where ya from?"
Chandler Bing,Unbelievable
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look at all the boxes!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?"
Chandler Bing,Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Chandler Bing,No-no
Chandler Bing,"OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?"
Chandler Bing,What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Chandler Bing,Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Chandler Bing,Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Chandler Bing,She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Chandler Bing,"She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
Chandler Bing,"I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
Chandler Bing,"No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh."
Chandler Bing,"Hey Mon, how's it going?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
Chandler Bing,No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Chandler Bing,"It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me."
Chandler Bing,"We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it."
Chandler Bing,"What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table."
Chandler Bing,"OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that."
Chandler Bing,That's not specific to girls.
Chandler Bing,And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Chandler Bing,"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Chandler Bing,I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Chandler Bing,"Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later."
Chandler Bing,Bye! Thank God
Chandler Bing,"Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place."
Chandler Bing,That's perfect! That's brilliant!
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh
Chandler Bing,"No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it."
Chandler Bing,"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Chandler Bing,Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Chandler Bing,Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Chandler Bing,"Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?"
Chandler Bing,"So, is Janine around?"
Chandler Bing,Can I check out what she did to my room?
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?"
Chandler Bing,"Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?"
Chandler Bing,"No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff."
Chandler Bing,Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Chandler Bing,Defend yourself.
Chandler Bing,Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?"
Chandler Bing,"Ohh, yeah."
Chandler Bing,That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
Chandler Bing,Yeah let's head off to work.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,You know...Oh My God.
Chandler Bing,Really.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth."
Chandler Bing,"No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?"
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,What???
Chandler Bing,I am proud of all my friends today.
Chandler Bing,"Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple."
Chandler Bing,"Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing."
Chandler Bing,You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Chandler Bing,"No thanks, Josephine."
Chandler Bing,"Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???"
Chandler Bing,"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers."
Chandler Bing,What is the matter with you ?!?
Chandler Bing,"You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!"
Chandler Bing,You're turning into a women.
Chandler Bing,Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Chandler Bing,Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Chandler Bing,"Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!"
Chandler Bing,Why can't I tell them that we live together?
Chandler Bing,Why haven't you told them?!
Chandler Bing,Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
Chandler Bing,Why wouldn't they be happy?
Chandler Bing,What? What? Why?!
Chandler Bing,Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?"
Chandler Bing,Well Monica just told me that they don't.
Chandler Bing,Do you know why?
Chandler Bing,Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
Chandler Bing,"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
Chandler Bing,Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Chandler Bing,.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!"
Chandler Bing,"Whoa, snowing out there?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
Chandler Bing,He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,You do? Why?
Chandler Bing,What?! Why did you do that?
Chandler Bing,How could it not matter?!
Chandler Bing,"What about all that ""friends forever"" stuff?"
Chandler Bing,Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Chandler Bing,"The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it."
Chandler Bing,Thank you!
Chandler Bing,I'll talk to them!
Chandler Bing,"Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights."
Chandler Bing,"I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me."
Chandler Bing,See now it feels like Christmas!
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe what's up?
Chandler Bing,I can see why that's hard to resist.
Chandler Bing,"You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?"
Chandler Bing,"What, what are you laughing at?"
Chandler Bing,I don't think so.
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
Chandler Bing,What? That's terrible!
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, that makes it not terrible."
Chandler Bing,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
Chandler Bing,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I live here too."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
Chandler Bing,"If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don't, you don't do that every year do you?"
Chandler Bing,"You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?"
Chandler Bing,"Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!"
Chandler Bing,"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"
Chandler Bing,"Those are my gifts, I got them for you."
Chandler Bing,Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Chandler Bing,"Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hey guys!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Oh great!
Chandler Bing,Okay! Okay! Okay!
Chandler Bing,"Wait, we can't do this."
Chandler Bing,"I don't wanna know what Monica got me. Y'know? I mean, look, I'm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about."
Chandler Bing,"Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don't know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present, and I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?"
Chandler Bing,Fine!
Chandler Bing,That's what you got me?
Chandler Bing,"Now you do that, you're on TV."
Chandler Bing,That's great!
Chandler Bing,"So you kissed her, so what happened after that?"
Chandler Bing,So she's just waiting over there for ya?
Chandler Bing,"Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff."
Chandler Bing,I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
Chandler Bing,A pharmacist.
Chandler Bing,You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Chandler Bing,You made pottery?
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore..."
Chandler Bing,"...so then the farmer says, ""That's not a cow and you're not milking it."""
Chandler Bing,"Look at us, we're a couple of couples!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys."
Chandler Bing,"And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night."
Chandler Bing,Oh that's too bad.
Chandler Bing,"That's funny, I saw no phlegm."
Chandler Bing,Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Chandler Bing,"Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!"
Chandler Bing,So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Chandler Bing,"And I am not blah, I am a hoot!"
Chandler Bing,"No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!"
Chandler Bing,"Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, one more time."
Chandler Bing,Perfect decibel.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah."
Chandler Bing,That's totally understandable.
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah!
Chandler Bing,"And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, ""Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."""
Chandler Bing,Y'know I think you can take her.
Chandler Bing,Did you hear that?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
Chandler Bing,You okay?
Chandler Bing,That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Chandler Bing,I made that joke up.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard."
Chandler Bing,"Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?"
Chandler Bing,Seriously?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I guess."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke."
Chandler Bing,It's my joke.
Chandler Bing,"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up."
Chandler Bing,"Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny."
Chandler Bing,"What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?"
Chandler Bing,"Joey, why is your cable out?"
Chandler Bing,"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?"
Chandler Bing,Whoa ho.
Chandler Bing,"All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?"
Chandler Bing,Paid your phone bill?
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
Chandler Bing,And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
Chandler Bing,You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Chandler Bing,"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
Chandler Bing,"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,Okay .
Chandler Bing,"He took my joke, he took it."
Chandler Bing,"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,Picking Rachel.
Chandler Bing,Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Chandler Bing,So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
Chandler Bing,"I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse."
Chandler Bing,It's my joke.
Chandler Bing,It's my joke.
Chandler Bing,Let's have Monica decide.
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,"Mon, get out here!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is."
Chandler Bing,Because you're the only one that can be fair.
Chandler Bing,"Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
Chandler Bing,Can I finish my story?!
Chandler Bing,"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up."
Chandler Bing,I'm not arguing with that.
Chandler Bing,Is not.
Chandler Bing,"Hi, oh hi."
Chandler Bing,"Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit."
Chandler Bing,I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Chandler Bing,You're a little high maintenance.
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you."
Chandler Bing,I'm off the list.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.
Chandler Bing,This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?"
Chandler Bing,I'm so sorry you're sick.
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
Chandler Bing,Yes?
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, introduce us!"
Chandler Bing,Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Chandler Bing,"I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids."
Chandler Bing,That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy."
Chandler Bing,Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
Chandler Bing,"That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe."
Chandler Bing,"Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep."
Chandler Bing,I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Chandler Bing,Would you please get some rest!
Chandler Bing,Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way."
Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no-no!
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?"
Chandler Bing,It's nice.
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,"It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?"
Chandler Bing,Oh come on you big faker!
Chandler Bing,Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,What are you doing here?
Chandler Bing,We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Chandler Bing,He's taking off her coat!
Chandler Bing,"Ho-oh, he's gonna get some! Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y'know so umm, he's closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. Well, I'm off to bed!"
Chandler Bing,I'm good.
Chandler Bing,Is that a swing?
Chandler Bing,Yuck!
Chandler Bing,That was like 5 years ago.
Chandler Bing,Joey...
Chandler Bing,"Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!"
Chandler Bing,Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Chandler Bing,I'm not macho.
Chandler Bing,"No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy."
Chandler Bing,"I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry."
Chandler Bing,"Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin."
Chandler Bing,Oh they didn't want to come!
Chandler Bing,"No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!"
Chandler Bing,You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Chandler Bing,Phoebe Buffay In Buffay The Vampire Layer.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn."
Chandler Bing,Her ankle is what you're watching?
Chandler Bing,She's just doing her job!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,There's no back to this couch!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside."
Chandler Bing,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Chandler Bing,"No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then."
Chandler Bing,"Aww, I love you so..."
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,So you didn't mean any of that?!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Chandler Bing,I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
Chandler Bing,"I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate."
Chandler Bing,Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Chandler Bing,Sure I would!
Chandler Bing,"What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?"
Chandler Bing,"What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not ""Archie Comic funny."""
Chandler Bing,Was his question what's more boring than him?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride."
Chandler Bing,Ehh.
Chandler Bing,I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,All right!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Chandler Bing,"Uh-oh, it's my boss!"
Chandler Bing,Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!"
Chandler Bing,"I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead."
Chandler Bing,"Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, ""Bring me food."" Two is, ""I'm with a girl, bring us food."" Three is, ""I'm lost and I can't find food."""
Chandler Bing,"Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, anything for you sir?"
Chandler Bing,It's not all juice!
Chandler Bing,Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Chandler Bing,Aww.
Chandler Bing,You wanna share it?
Chandler Bing,What's this?
Chandler Bing,"Aww, thanks man."
Chandler Bing,"Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story."
Chandler Bing,"Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them."
Chandler Bing,"No, the doctors say it may kill her."
Chandler Bing,But I think we should tell her.
Chandler Bing,"Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack."
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I could make it seem like he's here. ""Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."""
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,What was tonight?
Chandler Bing,Okay. What was tonight?
Chandler Bing,With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
Chandler Bing,Nine.
Chandler Bing,"Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?"
Chandler Bing,Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
Chandler Bing,No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,So was I.
Chandler Bing,We can't do this.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you."
Chandler Bing,I do like that.
Chandler Bing,"Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?"
Chandler Bing,Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,I have some moves.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, let's just forget it."
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah.
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Chandler Bing,"So you uh, want to do something tonight?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when..."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?"
Chandler Bing,I bet he can.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!"
Chandler Bing,Okay to come in?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
Chandler Bing,I'm the ruptured spleen.
Chandler Bing,Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend."
Chandler Bing,"I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a ""doctor..."""
Chandler Bing,"No, there were two."
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Chandler Bing,I see where you're goin'!
Chandler Bing,"Ah, finally an explanation."
Chandler Bing,"Hey-hey, is Monica here?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, look I need your help, I don't know what to get her for Valentine's Day."
Chandler Bing,She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.
Chandler Bing,"Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend and her brother, I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."
Chandler Bing,I made a...
Chandler Bing,Nothing!
Chandler Bing,"Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?"
Chandler Bing,"This, this actually is a..."
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?"
Chandler Bing,Do we have to make the entire thing?
Chandler Bing,"Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, are you aware unagi is an eel?"
Chandler Bing,I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Chandler Bing,I'm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon."
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, I can't give this to her."
Chandler Bing,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Okay. Yes honey, I made it myself. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, come here! Come here."
Chandler Bing,"Now, it's not wrapped because I just, just finished it."
Chandler Bing,But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Chandler Bing,Maybe we'll have to listen and see!
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,It's a sock bunny.
Chandler Bing,Not really.
Chandler Bing,"I see. Y'know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's okay. I don't..."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape."
Chandler Bing,Wow! You are way to young to have seen that!
Chandler Bing,You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,You have done enough!
Chandler Bing,"No you don't-get it in black, not brown."
Chandler Bing,Oop!
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake."
Chandler Bing,Who the hell is Carl?!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?"
Chandler Bing,Oh my good God.
Chandler Bing,"Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, the mixed tape."
Chandler Bing,No! You're the sweetest!
Chandler Bing,"I am so, so, so, so sorry!"
Chandler Bing,"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!"
Chandler Bing,"Come on Monica, it's our Valentine's Day. Please? Please-please, please?"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"So, are we going in there?"
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?"
Chandler Bing,A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, is that against the rules?"
Chandler Bing,I see.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years."
Chandler Bing,"You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh okay, I'll-I'll try."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah so, Tuesday?"
Chandler Bing,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,You just thought of that in there?
Chandler Bing,What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Chandler Bing,How's your room Rach?
Chandler Bing,Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Chandler Bing,"God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!"
Chandler Bing,Oh that's great! Good for you.
Chandler Bing,"Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!"
Chandler Bing,"Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye."
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
Chandler Bing,"Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time."
Chandler Bing,"No, we only went out once."
Chandler Bing,Not once!
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business."
Chandler Bing,My friend's name is Joey.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I've always hated that Howie."
Chandler Bing,The nerve huh?
Chandler Bing,Refill?
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,I couldn't do it.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
Chandler Bing,"No, that was Dana Caplin."
Chandler Bing,Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Chandler Bing,Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!"
Chandler Bing,No-no-Really?!
Chandler Bing,"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh..."
Chandler Bing,Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later."
Chandler Bing,Ni-hi-ice!
Chandler Bing,"So, you busy Thursday?"
Chandler Bing,Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,No! No! No! I was so careful!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,So?!
Chandler Bing,It's Thursday! How was the audition?!
Chandler Bing,"Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here."
Chandler Bing,So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Chandler Bing,Isn't she cute? No!
Chandler Bing,"So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, tell her good luck with that."
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Chandler Bing,Oh that's so funny because we found someone too.
Chandler Bing,Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Chandler Bing,A face ass?
Chandler Bing,"No, our guy is just a floating head."
Chandler Bing,Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Chandler Bing,Our guy has great hair.
Chandler Bing,Our guy smells incredible.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you...don't look good Joe."
Chandler Bing,That's still in there?!
Chandler Bing,Is this a service you're providing me?
Chandler Bing,Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,Okay...
Chandler Bing,Just tell her the truth! Tell her you're not ready.
Chandler Bing,Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Chandler Bing,"Joey, I saw you push him!"
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?"
Chandler Bing,"I can see it now, ""Look dad, it's the Sphinx!"""
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Chandler Bing,Are you funny?
Chandler Bing,Turns out he is kinda funny.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat's name?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so you will meet our guys?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself."
Chandler Bing,"Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?"
Chandler Bing,You know the hotels?
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe you don't marry this one."
Chandler Bing,Good-good-good-good.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y'know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? Eldad come here!"
Chandler Bing,"Eldad, sit down. Move over! Move over now!"
Chandler Bing,There you go! There you are!
Chandler Bing,"Hi. Okay, you're too late okay? Because she's already with our guy."
Chandler Bing,It is the softest hair! Touch it!
Chandler Bing,Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! You dance for Rachel!
Chandler Bing,So what was it for anyway?
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?"
Chandler Bing,That is lucky.
Chandler Bing,"Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?"
Chandler Bing,"Whoa, she's pretty."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ok."
Chandler Bing,"Oh No, It's Terrific, It'S- It'S- Y'Know, You Deserve This, After All Your Years Of Struggling, You'Ve Finally Been Able To Crack Your Way Into Show Business."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, are we playing this?!"
Chandler Bing,Hey! How'd the audition go?
Chandler Bing,So it did go well.
Chandler Bing,Oh that's great!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Oh-oh, what are you doing?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, it is overdue."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on guys, it's not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren't for Monica's allergies. You're right, I could never lie to you. She hates you. Should I get that? Hello? Uh no, Joey's not here right now. Can I take a message? Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? Okay great. Bye."
Chandler Bing,Am I naked again?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh right, your allergies. All her, she hates you."
Chandler Bing,As crazy as soccer?
Chandler Bing,You mean you didn't get it from this?
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!"
Chandler Bing,"I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up."
Chandler Bing,"Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?"
Chandler Bing,"You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection."
Chandler Bing,"I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and..."
Chandler Bing,No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Chandler Bing,How is that worse?!
Chandler Bing,"You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
Chandler Bing,"Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!"
Chandler Bing,What happened?!!
Chandler Bing,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Chandler Bing,So--You got in voluntarily?!
Chandler Bing,BEND OVER?!!!
Chandler Bing,"Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
Chandler Bing,...And what did you bring?
Chandler Bing,Janice?
Chandler Bing,Janice?!
Chandler Bing,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
Chandler Bing,Cupping.
Chandler Bing,I can't believe I did this! What an idiot!
Chandler Bing,Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
Chandler Bing,Y'know what? I-I kinda have.
Chandler Bing,"You didn't see how mad he was, y'know?"
Chandler Bing,I KNEW IT!!!!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? Hello? Damnit! Hello? No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message I think. He's still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that's great news! Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! Yes! Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. By dog not flowers."
Chandler Bing,Please tell me you got the message!
Chandler Bing,"The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock."
Chandler Bing,"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!"
Chandler Bing,Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.
Chandler Bing,Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!"
Chandler Bing,Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, we could do this all day."
Chandler Bing,You are gonna be a huge star! I'm gonna hug ya!
Chandler Bing,All right!
Chandler Bing,"I think so. Yeah, get off me."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well thank you in advance."
Chandler Bing,Hey!!
Chandler Bing,Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Chandler Bing,Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!"
Chandler Bing,Ross!
Chandler Bing,There's a Mr. Bing!
Chandler Bing,"But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story... You're roommate in college died didn't he?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, we were just..."
Chandler Bing,"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby."
Chandler Bing,"No, the little girl creeps me out."
Chandler Bing,Why would the baby creep me out?
Chandler Bing,This is going in your book?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!"
Chandler Bing,"So do you think uh, Joey's more charming than me?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you wish."
Chandler Bing,Who?
Chandler Bing,Hmm.
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,Oh-oh.
Chandler Bing,We said seven!
Chandler Bing,"The only way that I said six would be if the seven's, let meet at seven, not at six."
Chandler Bing,Oh my good God.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,What does it say?!
Chandler Bing,"Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything."
Chandler Bing,I told you I should not wear this color.
Chandler Bing,So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Chandler Bing,Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Chandler Bing,"Hi, how are ya?"
Chandler Bing,The reason he just said.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I've been there my friend."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I'll give up my ticket.
Chandler Bing,And I think Ross is generous too.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Ross.
Chandler Bing,"You've reached Monica and Chandler's, if you're listening to this message, we're probably screening. Yeah we are."
Chandler Bing,"This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! Yes, the groom-No! Not the groom!!"
Chandler Bing,See you later.
Chandler Bing,Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Chandler Bing,This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
Chandler Bing,"I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday."
Chandler Bing,Right here!
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready..."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Totally.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!"
Chandler Bing,"No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out."
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
Chandler Bing,Me too.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Oh all right.
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place."
Chandler Bing,Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?"
Chandler Bing,"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please."
Chandler Bing,"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring."
Chandler Bing,No. How are ya Paul?
Chandler Bing,"No, did he hug you?!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,I'm a little busy here Paul.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay."
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,Do you have my credit card?
Chandler Bing,Thank God!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I can't go."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,They put you in jail?
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
Chandler Bing,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Chandler Bing,It was the ring!
Chandler Bing,I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Chandler Bing,"No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect."
Chandler Bing,I can't do that.
Chandler Bing,Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him."
Chandler Bing,"Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew."
Chandler Bing,No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, that's enough honey!"
Chandler Bing,"Great! Okay, here."
Chandler Bing,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
Chandler Bing,Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, check out the ring."
Chandler Bing,"Yep, pretty much."
Chandler Bing,Heyyyy-What?
Chandler Bing,"Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends."
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,Check out the ring.
Chandler Bing,"Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well tonight's the big night."
Chandler Bing,"It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,I'm not gonna mess it up.
Chandler Bing,She's not gonna say no.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Give me it!
Chandler Bing,Phoebe!
Chandler Bing,Hi Monica.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!"
Chandler Bing,I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you could also give back the money you owe me."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids."
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!"
Chandler Bing,"Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, right here in my pocket. Pheebs?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she's gonna know."
Chandler Bing,You are beautiful.
Chandler Bing,"One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here."
Chandler Bing,Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you."
Chandler Bing,"Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with..."
Chandler Bing,"I know, but just let me say it."
Chandler Bing,"What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!"
Chandler Bing,"And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable."
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'll sit down."
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,"I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy."
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!"
Chandler Bing,Richard!
Chandler Bing,Oh you knew that. Good!
Chandler Bing,For camp!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!"
Chandler Bing,What did you guys just do?!
Chandler Bing,Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
Chandler Bing,"I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!"
Chandler Bing,Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
Chandler Bing,This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Chandler Bing,"That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind."
Chandler Bing,"I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
Chandler Bing,Eh...
Chandler Bing,"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!"
Chandler Bing,"If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%."
Chandler Bing,"Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never."
Chandler Bing,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
Chandler Bing,"It's okay, I got a plan."
Chandler Bing,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,My-Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
Chandler Bing,Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
Chandler Bing,You're right.
Chandler Bing,Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
Chandler Bing,Okay great.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
Chandler Bing,"Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!"
Chandler Bing,Well where did she go?
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy."
Chandler Bing,Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Chandler Bing,Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Chandler Bing,And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Chandler Bing,"But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!"
Chandler Bing,"It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight."
Chandler Bing,Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
Chandler Bing,Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
Chandler Bing,"I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,What are you talking about?
Chandler Bing,Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
Chandler Bing,Well where... Where did she go?
Chandler Bing,I can't believe I ruined this.
Chandler Bing,Oh my God.
Chandler Bing,"Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Monica and I are engaged.
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you get her in here. You bolt the door. I'll be in the closet."
Chandler Bing,"It's okay, I want this to be your night too. To Monica."
Chandler Bing,To Monica!
Chandler Bing,"So when you said, ""Get up early,"" did you mean 1986?"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Know what I mean?
Chandler Bing,There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Chandler Bing,"I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me."
Chandler Bing,"Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!"
Chandler Bing,You look great!
Chandler Bing,You okay over there?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, don't worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody."
Chandler Bing,"Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
Chandler Bing,"Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
Chandler Bing,Joe?
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident."
Chandler Bing,It's happened to you?
Chandler Bing,"Well, what'd you do?"
Chandler Bing,I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, you can pass for 19."
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
Chandler Bing,"Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris."
Chandler Bing,We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Chandler Bing,"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away."
Chandler Bing,"It's Paris, who knows we're here!"
Chandler Bing,"Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!"
Chandler Bing,"What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!"
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, third base."
Chandler Bing,Why to save your dignity my man.
Chandler Bing,"Well, somebody should."
Chandler Bing,How is that ever going to happen?!
Chandler Bing,"I don't care, she slept with me."
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,What's the matter honey?
Chandler Bing,Already?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
Chandler Bing,What in God's name is that?!
Chandler Bing,"Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know."
Chandler Bing,Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Chandler Bing,"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Centerpieces!
Chandler Bing,"Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice."
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story."
Chandler Bing,What a sweet story.
Chandler Bing,Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood."
Chandler Bing,"Honey, it's gonna be okay."
Chandler Bing,"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I have some."
Chandler Bing,"Well, close to..."
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
Chandler Bing,"No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party."
Chandler Bing,"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I am!"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Ehh.
Chandler Bing,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do."
Chandler Bing,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
Chandler Bing,"Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
Chandler Bing,Sure you do.
Chandler Bing,You sure?
Chandler Bing,I love you so much.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, totally!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you guys!"
Chandler Bing,"So, what do you think?"
Chandler Bing,"Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint."
Chandler Bing,I got glasses!
Chandler Bing,No I didn't!
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,"You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?"
Chandler Bing,"That's okay Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything, so you don't have to get us..."
Chandler Bing,What we want honey.
Chandler Bing,Dying people say the craziest things.
Chandler Bing,Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.
Chandler Bing,Hey! How's the boat?!
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that."
Chandler Bing,Do you know what I was thinkin'?
Chandler Bing,"Nothing, I just like to go like this."
Chandler Bing,"Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
Chandler Bing,Then free as a bird. What's up?
Chandler Bing,"Well, did-did you correct him?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh no problem, maybe I'll play with my left hand."
Chandler Bing,Does anybody know me?!
Chandler Bing,Don't worry about it Pheebs.
Chandler Bing,An old cookie?
Chandler Bing,We can't accept this.
Chandler Bing,'Cause it's gross.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, we owe you a present."
Chandler Bing,I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Chandler Bing,"Daddy. All right look, here's the story. Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. So I take off my glasses and that's when in happened."
Chandler Bing,Guys?
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Chandler Bing,Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Chandler Bing,Not that big a deal? There...there was touching of things.
Chandler Bing,I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Chandler Bing,If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Chandler Bing,"All right, I'm off to see your dad."
Chandler Bing,"Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass."
Chandler Bing,"So you understand, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people what happened. Y'know, I'm a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it."
Chandler Bing,What did you do when they found out?
Chandler Bing,So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Chandler Bing,It's your mommy. It's your mommy.
Chandler Bing,That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Chandler Bing,And say nothing?
Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no. Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
Chandler Bing,Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Chandler Bing,"No I'm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no, I can't do that."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
Chandler Bing,"No, he visited a little town south of throw up. So what was Phoebe's secret?"
Chandler Bing,That's it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Chandler Bing,Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Chandler Bing,What about him?
Chandler Bing,Let me see this guy. W-H-Wow! Don't show this to Monica! And don't tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh it's always nicer to here than, ""Aw crap! You again!"""
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah?
Chandler Bing,Did you not understand the story?
Chandler Bing,Hey! What's up?
Chandler Bing,Huh.
Chandler Bing,No! Shhh!
Chandler Bing,Nancy Thompson's getting fired!
Chandler Bing,I had too okay?! We're getting married! Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Chandler Bing,Du-ude!
Chandler Bing,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
Chandler Bing,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
Chandler Bing,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
Chandler Bing,"You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!"
Chandler Bing,Ross came in forth and cried!
Chandler Bing,Of course it is. Wow-whoa!
Chandler Bing,Hey!!!
Chandler Bing,That was you!
Chandler Bing,You have no trouble telling time now right?
Chandler Bing,Quick! What time is it?!
Chandler Bing,Y'know when I said that because we're getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Chandler Bing,Yeah that was stupid. Let's not do that.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with...all the guys in my office."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Chandler Bing,What are you guys doing?
Chandler Bing,"Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist."
Chandler Bing,"No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this..."
Chandler Bing,"I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm not in that."
Chandler Bing,"All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going."
Chandler Bing,How about those three pointers?
Chandler Bing,And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom."
Chandler Bing,They have that on the napkins at the club.
Chandler Bing,"Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?"
Chandler Bing,Dude that is so sad.
Chandler Bing,Could I play?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"No, I am."
Chandler Bing,I do?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Aww!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Chandler Bing,I can't help it!
Chandler Bing,Borrow money from me?
Chandler Bing,Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I'm right here!
Chandler Bing,I'm still right here!
Chandler Bing,"Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
Chandler Bing,Can you people not see me?!
Chandler Bing,There I am!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down..."
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,Ahhh.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, that looks good."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,I'm marrying her.
Chandler Bing,Die Hard still great!
Chandler Bing,What'd you rent?
Chandler Bing,"Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I just got uh, got plans."
Chandler Bing,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
Chandler Bing,That's sweet.
Chandler Bing,"So uh, what did this woman look like?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
Chandler Bing,"No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive... Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album."
Chandler Bing,"Well, let's see... Okay uh, is that her?"
Chandler Bing,"Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend."
Chandler Bing,"No, we're still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her."
Chandler Bing,"Well, 'cause she came back the third summer and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow..."
Chandler Bing,"I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow..."""
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. Seriously, good luck marrying me."
Chandler Bing,Can you figure out what I'm doing?
Chandler Bing,Who?
Chandler Bing,Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Chandler Bing,What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!"
Chandler Bing,"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me."
Chandler Bing,"It's a nickname, I'll explain later."
Chandler Bing,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
Chandler Bing,"You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!"
Chandler Bing,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Chandler Bing,I would really love it if could do both.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Chandler Bing,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
Chandler Bing,You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Chandler Bing,"Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica."
Chandler Bing,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Chandler Bing,I'd carry you around in my pocket.
Chandler Bing,Skidmark's still got a way with the ladies.
Chandler Bing,...Come on! Why are we here?!
Chandler Bing,The hot chicks?
Chandler Bing,Wow that's actually pretty cool.
Chandler Bing,Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Chandler Bing,"You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?"
Chandler Bing,"OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?"
Chandler Bing,Did she freak out?
Chandler Bing,Right.
Chandler Bing,You said no right?
Chandler Bing,You said no right?!
Chandler Bing,Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
Chandler Bing,What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Chandler Bing,Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Chandler Bing,No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Chandler Bing,Yes!!
Chandler Bing,Yes!!!
Chandler Bing,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it."
Chandler Bing,I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Chandler Bing,Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Chandler Bing,Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
Chandler Bing,Is that what you're thinking about right now?
Chandler Bing,"Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight."
Chandler Bing,"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
Chandler Bing,Say again?
Chandler Bing,"Feelings, such strong feelings."
Chandler Bing,I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no. No-no-no."
Chandler Bing,"No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes."
Chandler Bing,"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen ."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay, time's up!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?"
Chandler Bing,Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.
Chandler Bing,Oooh that may be a New World's record
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states."
Chandler Bing,"I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!"
Chandler Bing,"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!"
Chandler Bing,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment."
Chandler Bing,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Chandler Bing,Which smells delicious!
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!"
Chandler Bing,Huh! Where is the dog?!
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!"
Chandler Bing,What is it doing here?
Chandler Bing,"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!"
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,"Well, it still has to go, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's um..."
Chandler Bing,"I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs."
Chandler Bing,"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit."
Chandler Bing,Is there a puppy here?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you are new!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."
Chandler Bing,"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!"
Chandler Bing,Here I am.
Chandler Bing,How did you...know?
Chandler Bing,Where's Monica?
Chandler Bing,Why not?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I, I should go in there."
Chandler Bing,Why not?
Chandler Bing,This is ridiculous.
Chandler Bing,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?"
Chandler Bing,And that doesn't scare you?
Chandler Bing,"No, no he went for a walk."
Chandler Bing,"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain."
Chandler Bing,Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Chandler Bing,It is so good to see you!
Chandler Bing,It's up to you.
Chandler Bing,All right.
Chandler Bing,You got it. You got Nevada twice.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there."
Chandler Bing,Okay. Okay.
Chandler Bing,That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
Chandler Bing,Hey! What are you guys doing?
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, who?"
Chandler Bing,But we don't know the neighbors.
Chandler Bing,Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Chandler Bing,"Eh, somebody's in a good mood!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, either that or uh..."
Chandler Bing,Am not!
Chandler Bing,"Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?"
Chandler Bing,4:00 A.M.
Chandler Bing,"I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us."
Chandler Bing,Mm! Night Gar'!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!"
Chandler Bing,Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Chandler Bing,What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Chandler Bing,"Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker."
Chandler Bing,What is the matter with you?
Chandler Bing,"Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that's her."
Chandler Bing,Y'know what would work?
Chandler Bing,Stop making candy!
Chandler Bing,You mean they like you.
Chandler Bing,Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Chandler Bing,What is going on?
Chandler Bing,Joey!
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,"Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas."
Chandler Bing,"All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?"
Chandler Bing,No not Candy Lady.
Chandler Bing,"All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!"
Chandler Bing,You're welcome.
Chandler Bing,No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
Chandler Bing,Buh-bye. I just got us reservations at Michelle's and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Chandler Bing,...betrothed couple.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Pheebs?
Chandler Bing,Skull?
Chandler Bing,How long have we been home?
Chandler Bing,Lovely!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?"
Chandler Bing,Why not?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Chandler Bing,"Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him."
Chandler Bing,"No reason, except...she...told...me."
Chandler Bing,"No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now."
Chandler Bing,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
Chandler Bing,"Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?"
Chandler Bing,Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Chandler Bing,Is this because of the burrito thing?
Chandler Bing,Give him money? It was a joke!
Chandler Bing,"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Had the money in the wrong hand.
Chandler Bing,How do you know so much about this?
Chandler Bing,"Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
Chandler Bing,Mustached bastard...
Chandler Bing,Excuse me...
Chandler Bing,Ahh-hahaha!
Chandler Bing,"Thank you Gunther, put it there. Definitely not easier with coins. Thank you."
Chandler Bing,Hey Pheebs!
Chandler Bing,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
Chandler Bing,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!"
Chandler Bing,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Chandler Bing,"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
Chandler Bing,Santa? Really?
Chandler Bing,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Chandler Bing,Then it's okay!
Chandler Bing,"Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
Chandler Bing,My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
Chandler Bing,Ohh. Mmm.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
Chandler Bing,It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler Bing,I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Chandler Bing,Because it's too delicious.
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person."
Chandler Bing,So...
Chandler Bing,"Oh, what's at 8:00?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends."
Chandler Bing,I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Chandler Bing,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Chandler Bing,I can't seem to say goodbye.
Chandler Bing,Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Chandler Bing,Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Chandler Bing,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Chandler Bing,"Well, thank you for lunch."
Chandler Bing,So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
Chandler Bing,Mrs. Braverman must be out.
Chandler Bing,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
Chandler Bing,"Well, we don't want that."
Chandler Bing,But we should take it.
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Chandler Bing,"I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it."
Chandler Bing,What are you doing tonight?
Chandler Bing,Dude! Dude!
Chandler Bing,"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00."
Chandler Bing,That's what Monica said.
Chandler Bing,Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Chandler Bing,I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!"
Chandler Bing,Oh yes!
Chandler Bing,Oh yes!
Chandler Bing,Oh yes! Oh yes!
Chandler Bing,"Well that's not fair, you've already had some!"
Chandler Bing,What do we use to split it?
Chandler Bing,"Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured..."
Chandler Bing,"All right, I'll pick that one."
Chandler Bing,Ohhh!
Chandler Bing,"Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my..."
Chandler Bing,Stick to your side!
Chandler Bing,That's a plane!
Chandler Bing,"No, I'm not!"
Chandler Bing,Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!
Chandler Bing,Monica!
Chandler Bing,"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?"
Chandler Bing,"Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like..."
Chandler Bing,What?! Ow!
Chandler Bing,"Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep."
Chandler Bing,It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
Chandler Bing,"No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading."
Chandler Bing,That's correct.
Chandler Bing,What? What? What?
Chandler Bing,Yeah! You?
Chandler Bing,Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Chandler Bing,Do you know what just happened?
Chandler Bing,No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
Chandler Bing,Monica?
Chandler Bing,"I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor."
Chandler Bing,"Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work."
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes..."
Chandler Bing,Do you wanna?
Chandler Bing,"Couldn't I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
Chandler Bing,Sorry!
Chandler Bing,"Joey! Joe! Full bag. Beer's still cold. Something terrible must've happened here! Oh no-no-no-no-no-no! Stevie, I was never here!"
Chandler Bing,"My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'd love to but I've tried that so many times they won't even let me in the store anymore."
Chandler Bing,Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Chandler Bing,That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!
Chandler Bing,Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?
Chandler Bing,I thought I broke Joey's chair! That's why I replaced it with mine!
Chandler Bing,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
Chandler Bing,I'm gettin' my chair back!
Chandler Bing,Joey you broke my chair!!
Chandler Bing,I think I should get the chair!
Chandler Bing,"Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, where's the logic in that?!"
Chandler Bing,So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Chandler Bing,What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Chandler Bing,She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Chandler Bing,"No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun."
Chandler Bing,"Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?"
Chandler Bing,Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man."
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!"
Chandler Bing,Ohh!
Chandler Bing,Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on."
Chandler Bing,Hey-hey are you drunk?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!"
Chandler Bing,Yes!
Chandler Bing,Yes!!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, here's the thing. We're gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'll take care of it."
Chandler Bing,Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Chandler Bing,"That's still yours. Okay, now remember it's a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress."
Chandler Bing,See? Here we go.
Chandler Bing,Phil.
Chandler Bing,"Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. Okay, you're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fine."
Chandler Bing,Monica's a little drunk.
Chandler Bing,Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Chandler Bing,Monica's wasted.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, will you just go help her change please!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
Chandler Bing,"For my last birthday you gave me a hug! Okay, read the card! Read the card!"
Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Chandler Bing,"No, because you're not a grandmother!"
Chandler Bing,Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.
Chandler Bing,How are you feeling?
Chandler Bing,"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone."
Chandler Bing,Pheebs!!
Chandler Bing,I think it's necessary.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, here we go."
Chandler Bing,Hey! How'd it go?
Chandler Bing,"Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds."
Chandler Bing,Monica said wedding.
Chandler Bing,Do you think you could get through a poem?
Chandler Bing,Too?
Chandler Bing,"Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking."
Chandler Bing,That's great!
Chandler Bing,So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Chandler Bing,Don't do it.
Chandler Bing,I think it's the dying cat parade.
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""You're half Scottish right?"""
Chandler Bing,Yes!!
Chandler Bing,Why is your family Ross?!
Chandler Bing,"If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I feel like a snack!"
Chandler Bing,Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Chandler Bing,"Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories."
Chandler Bing,We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Chandler Bing,"That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding."
Chandler Bing,Because we hate them.
Chandler Bing,We have heard you play.
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,You mean the spitter?
Chandler Bing,Easy for you to say; you'll be wearing a veil.
Chandler Bing,You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Chandler Bing,"Sorry, I just don't like the idea of when I say, ""I do,"" he's thinking, ""Yeah, I'd do her too!"""
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Chandler Bing,"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
Chandler Bing,"No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together."
Chandler Bing,Joe...
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, we haven't found anybody else."
Chandler Bing,Yeah you can do it.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Our minister...
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Should we call the spitter?
Chandler Bing,Yeah. O-okay.
Chandler Bing,"See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
Chandler Bing,"No, not us... Us!"
Chandler Bing,"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories."
Chandler Bing,Joe?
Chandler Bing,Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?
Chandler Bing,And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Chandler Bing,But then later that night...
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Well I was... I was exactly expecting company after... 9:15.
Chandler Bing,"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride's maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink. And you've just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!"
Chandler Bing,You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Chandler Bing,But we don't do that.
Chandler Bing,How drunk are you?
Chandler Bing,That's the perfect amount!
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?"
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Chandler Bing,Yep!
Chandler Bing,Count of three?
Chandler Bing,Two!
Chandler Bing,Three!
Chandler Bing,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Chandler Bing,Eh!
Chandler Bing,Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...
Chandler Bing,No! No! No!
Chandler Bing,They're in my bag over there.
Chandler Bing,"Uh, could you leave me one?"
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,No I-I-I'm fine.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Chandler Bing,So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's not important? It's not important?! If it wasn't for a bride's maid you'd be marrying him not me!"
Chandler Bing,I don't believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I'm runner up.
Chandler Bing,Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's just weird! Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need...I don't know what I need. I need a walk."
Chandler Bing,"It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin."
Chandler Bing,Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler Bing,"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding..."
Chandler Bing,How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Chandler Bing,That's what you should say.
Chandler Bing,When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.
Chandler Bing,I'd love it if you would do it.
Chandler Bing,But those are the words! Those exact words!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important."
Chandler Bing,So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Chandler Bing,Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Chandler Bing,Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
Chandler Bing,Do you want me to call?
Chandler Bing,Staying out of the way.
Chandler Bing,Sure! That's one of the great things about being engaged. I'm not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Chandler Bing,Smooth.
Chandler Bing,"So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?"
Chandler Bing,Huh.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!"
Chandler Bing,Really? Right across the street?
Chandler Bing,When'd you meet her?
Chandler Bing,Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
Chandler Bing,Hi! How'd it go?
Chandler Bing,Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
Chandler Bing,"So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?"
Chandler Bing,Bye!
Chandler Bing,Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
Chandler Bing,What are you guys talking about?
Chandler Bing,But I love swing music!
Chandler Bing,"Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too."
Chandler Bing,I don't want to say.
Chandler Bing,Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Chandler Bing,"Hi, honey! I'm home!"
Chandler Bing,Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?"
Chandler Bing,Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
Chandler Bing,Well then why can't I see it?
Chandler Bing,Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?"
Chandler Bing,Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Chandler Bing,Oh totally! Pull my finger.
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
Chandler Bing,Kinda. They're really big.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
Chandler Bing,"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating."
Chandler Bing,"I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives."
Chandler Bing,"Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink."
Chandler Bing,Water! Water! Water!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Chandler Bing,Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...
Chandler Bing,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
Chandler Bing,That's me! Come on!
Chandler Bing,"Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
Chandler Bing,Hi! Nice to meet you!
Chandler Bing,I'll be right with you.
Chandler Bing,I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
Chandler Bing,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
Chandler Bing,"This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins."
Chandler Bing,Y'know I think we should invite them.
Chandler Bing,Well this is just sad!
Chandler Bing,"Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
Chandler Bing,"Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice."
Chandler Bing,You mean like for award shows?
Chandler Bing,"You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"""
Chandler Bing,"Okay, who wore those?"
Chandler Bing,Not bad.
Chandler Bing,Who's that?
Chandler Bing,Pierce Brosnan?
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?
Chandler Bing,007?! This is James Bond's tux?!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's not just that, I would be England's most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. Would Monica let me wear this?"
Chandler Bing,A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,You can't wear that! I'm wearing the famous tux! James Bond's tux!
Chandler Bing,So-If you wear that you'll make mine less special.
Chandler Bing,"Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!"
Chandler Bing,"Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you."
Chandler Bing,That was pretty 007.
Chandler Bing,Ross is Batman!
Chandler Bing,Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Chandler Bing,Batman has a utility belt!
Chandler Bing,Batman has the Batmobile!
Chandler Bing,Batman has Robin! We get ESPN right?
Chandler Bing,"Actually, I don't like martinis."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, yum!"
Chandler Bing,I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants are a little tight.
Chandler Bing,"Well, does that mean that you're not going to wearing yours?"
Chandler Bing,Let me try it on!
Chandler Bing,Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! What's this?
Chandler Bing,An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Chandler Bing,The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming."
Chandler Bing,All right! I found one that fits!
Chandler Bing,Whose is it?
Chandler Bing,Whose is it?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, come on! I don't care! Come on! Whose is it?"
Chandler Bing,Do you realize you get louder each week?
Chandler Bing,"I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow."
Chandler Bing,"Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
Chandler Bing,Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
Chandler Bing,"Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door."
Chandler Bing,"Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?"
Chandler Bing,There are seven?! That's one?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down."
Chandler Bing,Monica...
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,You'll get one.
Chandler Bing,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no."
Chandler Bing,"Uh, uh."
Chandler Bing,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
Chandler Bing,Nice try.
Chandler Bing,"Look, Monica..."
Chandler Bing,This is not going to work.
Chandler Bing,You are so great! I love you!
Chandler Bing,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
Chandler Bing,No I didn't!
Chandler Bing,No I didn't!
Chandler Bing,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Chandler Bing,"Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
Chandler Bing,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
Chandler Bing,Oh my God.
Chandler Bing,"Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?"
Chandler Bing,"I've had a very long, hard day."
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
Chandler Bing,"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken."
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke."
Chandler Bing,It happened in London.
Chandler Bing,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Chandler Bing,Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
Chandler Bing,Phoebe knows about us!
Chandler Bing,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
Chandler Bing,"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!"
Chandler Bing,"Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you're-you're going?"
Chandler Bing,"It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex."
Chandler Bing,Not if I kiss you first.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
Chandler Bing,Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Chandler Bing,Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Chandler Bing,"Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
Chandler Bing,Who are those people?
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,So we both finished our vows.
Chandler Bing,"Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, what do you guys think?"
Chandler Bing,You really like it?
Chandler Bing,I stole Monica's and changed the name.
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation."
Chandler Bing,I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close. I haven't seen him in years.
Chandler Bing,"Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
Chandler Bing,"Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
Chandler Bing,What's this?
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers-Think of the money we'll save!! We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Chandler Bing,Y'know we already went over this and I won!
Chandler Bing,Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Chandler Bing,"No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!"
Chandler Bing,He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Chandler Bing,Does it matter?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you."
Chandler Bing,So I really never get to win anymore?
Chandler Bing,No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go."
Chandler Bing,And there's daddy!
Chandler Bing,"Believe me, I've been saying that for years. Oh my God!"
Chandler Bing,That's Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Chandler Bing,He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience.
Chandler Bing,It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Chandler Bing,Chandler.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, they're a hoot."
Chandler Bing,Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Chandler Bing,Wait! Wait! We'd really love it if you could be there.
Chandler Bing,"I know it would make me happy, ma'am."
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Chandler Bing,When I was growing up I...played the one on the far left.
Chandler Bing,Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Chandler Bing,The young hot ball and chain.
Chandler Bing,What's up?
Chandler Bing,"Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night."
Chandler Bing,But you're still my friend?
Chandler Bing,"During this time...are you, are you still my best man?"
Chandler Bing,Do I still call you Ross?
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning."
Chandler Bing,So are we...friends again?
Chandler Bing,Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Chandler Bing,Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, include more people in this."
Chandler Bing,Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Chandler Bing,Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Honestly? Me too.
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll go all...Chandler. But nothing has.
Chandler Bing,Okay. I'll be right there.
Chandler Bing,We're the Bings.
Chandler Bing,Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,Mom. Thanks for wearing something.
Chandler Bing,Hi...dad.
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
Chandler Bing,Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
Chandler Bing,No! No! No! I can't do that!
Chandler Bing,"Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!"
Chandler Bing,The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity."
Chandler Bing,"I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge."
Chandler Bing,"Well yeah, but then..."
Chandler Bing,Depends on what you mean by we.
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?"
Chandler Bing,Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, excuse me for a minute."
Chandler Bing,"Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Oh fresh air!
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Ross!
Chandler Bing,That's right! I'm not!
Chandler Bing,I know about Monica.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking."
Chandler Bing,You don't know?
Chandler Bing,Monica's pregnant.
Chandler Bing,Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes...
Chandler Bing,"Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. New York.) Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary."
Chandler Bing,"But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay."
Chandler Bing,You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
Chandler Bing,Are you Joey?
Chandler Bing,You look beautiful. Is this new?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,He's Greek Orthodox.
Chandler Bing,"No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?"
Chandler Bing,I do.
Chandler Bing,I love you. And I know about the baby.
Chandler Bing,Our baby.
Chandler Bing,Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Chandler Bing,Then...who did?
Chandler Bing,What?! What are you talking about?
Chandler Bing,Who's the father?
Chandler Bing,Why not?
Chandler Bing,As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
Chandler Bing,Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Chandler Bing,Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
Chandler Bing,No?
Chandler Bing,I've been taking dancing lessons.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget."
Chandler Bing,So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery."
Chandler Bing,Not well.
Chandler Bing,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Chandler Bing,Funny: Ha-Ha Or Funny
Chandler Bing,What size shoes do you wear?
Chandler Bing,"Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?"
Chandler Bing,Those aren't eleven and a half.
Chandler Bing,And the world will never know.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives."
Chandler Bing,But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Chandler Bing,Did it turn into sand?
Chandler Bing,"No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,Hi! We're checking out of the bridal suite.
Chandler Bing,"And I'm the happiest guy in the world! Oh honey, come on don't be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!"
Chandler Bing,We got the honeymoon.
Chandler Bing,The wedding pictures?
Chandler Bing,Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Chandler Bing,"I'll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home."
Chandler Bing,What? What did you take a picture of?
Chandler Bing,"Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?"
Chandler Bing,Oh.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. 32 Joe. You're 32!"
Chandler Bing,Hey. Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Chandler Bing,Yeah but you don't need--What is this?
Chandler Bing,Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
Chandler Bing,The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said..."
Chandler Bing,So you don't have the cameras?!
Chandler Bing,So? What? What? They're gone! Monica's gonna freak!
Chandler Bing,Great.
Chandler Bing,Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Chandler Bing,Yes! And that's why I'm under the table. Celebrating.
Chandler Bing,"Well this is great. Y'know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she's really depressed."
Chandler Bing,All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can't believe I screwed this up!
Chandler Bing,Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?
Chandler Bing,Marriage advice? Really?!
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, Monica picked out the flowers."
Chandler Bing,She picked those out too.
Chandler Bing,That was her.
Chandler Bing,I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Chandler Bing,"Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?"
Chandler Bing,Uhh... Yeah sure. Click!
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah. I'll take, I'll take your picture."
Chandler Bing,Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
Chandler Bing,Why don't you go up on stage. I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you ready for the last picture?"
Chandler Bing,Get ready to run. Congratulations on your wedding.
Chandler Bing,We're back!
Chandler Bing,It's picture time.
Chandler Bing,"Here's a picture of Ross. And that's me. And that's me and Ross. Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple."
Chandler Bing,Eh?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, so this isn't a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with...with this lady. Which by the look on your face I'm sure you'll remember. So we don't need--There's no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now."
Chandler Bing,Okay. You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Chandler Bing,Call it even?!
Chandler Bing,Hey! Babe! Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
Chandler Bing,"Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama..."
Chandler Bing,I'd better go pack.
Chandler Bing,"A Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo. I'm gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, what was that all about?"
Chandler Bing,What?! I didn't even know that-Why didn't you tell me?! Why am I talking like this?!
Chandler Bing,What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper."
Chandler Bing,You already know.
Chandler Bing,"Oh honey, leave them alone, they're in love."
Chandler Bing,We are on our honeymoon.
Chandler Bing,"25J and K, any chance those aren't together?"
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,Just act like you belong.
Chandler Bing,Shh! Nice to see you again.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, of course."
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A."
Chandler Bing,Apology accepted. Excuse us.
Chandler Bing,Oh you've got to be kidding me.
Chandler Bing,We're you just ten seconds later!
Chandler Bing,We need the stuff.
Chandler Bing,What else is new?
Chandler Bing,"Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together."
Chandler Bing,"They're terrific, and they live right here in the city."
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, we're just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with."
Chandler Bing,"Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance..."
Chandler Bing,We really...didn't get a chance to...
Chandler Bing,Ross! It's got your wavy black lines!
Chandler Bing,Y'know who has a great video camera?
Chandler Bing,Let's call 'em.
Chandler Bing,Here you go.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"I don't know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape."
Chandler Bing,"I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong."
Chandler Bing,I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Chandler Bing,Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Chandler Bing,"The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
Chandler Bing,Was that another question?
Chandler Bing,Did you do it on our invitations?!
Chandler Bing,"So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!"
Chandler Bing,That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Chandler Bing,Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Chandler Bing,"You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?"
Chandler Bing,What's funny about that?
Chandler Bing,"Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?"
Chandler Bing,The Hard Rock Caf?
Chandler Bing,Again?!
Chandler Bing,You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he thinks that's my name."
Chandler Bing,"Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby."
Chandler Bing,"No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel."
Chandler Bing,Shh! It is a family name!
Chandler Bing,Hey Bob.
Chandler Bing,"If I see him, I'll ask."
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,We're on a semi-first name basis.
Chandler Bing,"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes."
Chandler Bing,But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
Chandler Bing,I think it's best sir.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em."
Chandler Bing,What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Chandler Bing,"Sure, what's up?"
Chandler Bing,Hey Bobby.
Chandler Bing,"Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here."
Chandler Bing,Bob!
Chandler Bing,Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Chandler Bing,Bob. Bob! Bob!!! What the hell are you doing?!
Chandler Bing,You're an actor!
Chandler Bing,"Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume..."
Chandler Bing,The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Chandler Bing,No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Chandler Bing,How is that me?
Chandler Bing,When have I ever done that?!
Chandler Bing,Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!
Chandler Bing,Oh! Hi!
Chandler Bing,Joey's gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.
Chandler Bing,"You'd think that would embarrass me, but you see I'm maxed out."
Chandler Bing,Marry her.
Chandler Bing,Howdy doody.
Chandler Bing,"Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed."
Chandler Bing,What question?
Chandler Bing,There's no question.
Chandler Bing,You picked Ross?!
Chandler Bing,I cannot believe you didn't pick me.
Chandler Bing,Oh really?! You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it?
Chandler Bing,You're going down.
Chandler Bing,That means nothing to me. Come on!
Chandler Bing,And dignity.
Chandler Bing,Nope! I can do this all day.
Chandler Bing,"God, I'm exhausted."
Chandler Bing,No way! If anything you've gotta let me win! My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
Chandler Bing,You're Spudnik.
Chandler Bing,Fine. Oh no!
Chandler Bing,"Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win."
Chandler Bing,"No, I let him win-Ross!"
Chandler Bing,Would you tell her I let you win please?
Chandler Bing,I am strong! I'll show you!
Chandler Bing,Oh what's the matter? Are you scared?
Chandler Bing,Okay. 1...2...3-Go! I'm gonna kill myself!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this."
Chandler Bing,"No, it wasn't you."
Chandler Bing,I got a maid. Yay!
Chandler Bing,"Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control..."
Chandler Bing,"Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?"
Chandler Bing,What's the matter?
Chandler Bing,See? I told you.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Chandler Bing,She must've been planning this for years!
Chandler Bing,"Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?"
Chandler Bing,"So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?"
Chandler Bing,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,How come?
Chandler Bing,To see her pants?
Chandler Bing,Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Chandler Bing,"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?"
Chandler Bing,Oh dear God!
Chandler Bing,And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
Chandler Bing,Here's another plan...No!
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Chandler Bing,You see that?
Chandler Bing,All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Chandler Bing,You need new clothes.
Chandler Bing,I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
Chandler Bing,Brenda a bee!
Chandler Bing,Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
Chandler Bing,You do?
Chandler Bing,I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
Chandler Bing,Her what?!!
Chandler Bing,You had a bachelorette party?!
Chandler Bing,"I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition."
Chandler Bing,You went home with the waitress.
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Chandler Bing,My God! You must be good in bed!
Chandler Bing,She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
Chandler Bing,"Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...
Chandler Bing,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore."
Chandler Bing,All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
Chandler Bing,And Joey.
Chandler Bing,"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough."
Chandler Bing,I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
Chandler Bing,"You're right, this is more fun."
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,That's me.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, yeah right over there."
Chandler Bing,That was weird.
Chandler Bing,So she's a...
Chandler Bing,I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Chandler Bing,"Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?"
Chandler Bing,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone."
Chandler Bing,"Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway."
Chandler Bing,Why would she do that?
Chandler Bing,This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Chandler Bing,In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
Chandler Bing,Why me?!
Chandler Bing,Which is why you should do it.
Chandler Bing,You do it!
Chandler Bing,"All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?"
Chandler Bing,I don't think we've actually done this before!
Chandler Bing,Well we...we still hang out.
Chandler Bing,"Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other."
Chandler Bing,"Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?"
Chandler Bing,Monica! Wait!
Chandler Bing,Carry on.
Chandler Bing,Could you not narrate?
Chandler Bing,I have no idea.
Chandler Bing,Yeah! I'm just pretending to watch the game so I don't have to help out with stuff.
Chandler Bing,Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Chandler Bing,Yeah! Anderson just scored again! There's no Anderson.
Chandler Bing,"Oh hey. I'd shake your hand but uh; I'm really into the game. Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other."
Chandler Bing,"I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, it's been a while since we've screamed something. Maybe we should."
Chandler Bing,Oh come on!
Chandler Bing,Good game!
Chandler Bing,Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Chandler Bing,Detroit.
Chandler Bing,Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
Chandler Bing,Did she look 16?
Chandler Bing,"Well, she probably wasn't familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
Chandler Bing,New haircut? Necklace? Dress? Boots? Boots!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna miss being able to afford food.
Chandler Bing,She had a point.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah well, too bad we're gonna have to return them."
Chandler Bing,I have you.
Chandler Bing,Hey-hey.
Chandler Bing,You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I don't think you did a very thorough job!
Chandler Bing,What's wrong?
Chandler Bing,"Oh don't forget, my office holiday party is tonight."
Chandler Bing,"Now sweetie, I know you don't like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a...supple leather lining."
Chandler Bing,Why not?
Chandler Bing,Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Chandler Bing,"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, that party wasn't bad."
Chandler Bing,"I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?"
Chandler Bing,"What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go."
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.
Chandler Bing,Hop on.
Chandler Bing,"Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go."
Chandler Bing,Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?
Chandler Bing,I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
Chandler Bing,I don't have your boots.
Chandler Bing,"Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!"
Chandler Bing,"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
Chandler Bing,Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
Chandler Bing,"I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry."
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work."
Chandler Bing,Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
Chandler Bing,It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
Chandler Bing,Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
Chandler Bing,Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
Chandler Bing,Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch."
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl."
Chandler Bing,It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
Chandler Bing,Oh no-no-no!
Chandler Bing,Hi honey I'm home.
Chandler Bing,"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet."
Chandler Bing,Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Chandler Bing,Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang...
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay."
Chandler Bing,I kinda like it here.
Chandler Bing,Well what did it do?
Chandler Bing,A vending machine?
Chandler Bing,Who cares? It's a stupid game.
Chandler Bing,I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
Chandler Bing,Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Chandler Bing,You are not going to believe what I did today!
Chandler Bing,I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
Chandler Bing,"Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!"
Chandler Bing,"Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words."
Chandler Bing,Because it's awesome.
Chandler Bing,"Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge."
Chandler Bing,It is when you put it together with that one.
Chandler Bing,"Come on, he won't even know what they mean."
Chandler Bing,Have you talked to him lately?
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!"
Chandler Bing,With the claw?!
Chandler Bing,Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
Chandler Bing,I did. But it came at a price.
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!"
Chandler Bing,One more score to go! You can do it!
Chandler Bing,All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Chandler Bing,"Are you, are you high?"
Chandler Bing,Really? I don't like baths.
Chandler Bing,"Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady."
Chandler Bing,Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Chandler Bing,"Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, what's up?!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back."
Chandler Bing,Do you?
Chandler Bing,In London?
Chandler Bing,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London."
Chandler Bing,If that.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Sex on the balcony?
Chandler Bing,What is it?
Chandler Bing,"Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, this does butch it up a bit."
Chandler Bing,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
Chandler Bing,"All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat."
Chandler Bing,Oh my God.
Chandler Bing,I'm going to need a bigger boat.
Chandler Bing,"I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong."
Chandler Bing,I'm in the bathtub.
Chandler Bing,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!"
Chandler Bing,The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!"
Chandler Bing,I had the exact same conversation.
Chandler Bing,I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
Chandler Bing,"All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?"
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,He didn't say anything about that to me.
Chandler Bing,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
Chandler Bing,But what did he mean by rules?
Chandler Bing,Because he was looking at her differently.
Chandler Bing,My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Chandler Bing,You don't say anything.
Chandler Bing,I'm not going to let you say anything.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, God!"
Chandler Bing,Do I smell essential oils?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,L-leaving my troubles behind?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,You told her?!
Chandler Bing,Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
Chandler Bing,You like Rachel?!
Chandler Bing,Yes we're all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Chandler Bing,I'll...I'll get you later!
Chandler Bing,Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
Chandler Bing,You're not?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey Pheebs, what's up?"
Chandler Bing,"Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning...Don't let Phoebe in."
Chandler Bing,"Well, Phoebe I thought I'd--Yeah, what the hell."
Chandler Bing,Hey babe.
Chandler Bing,Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
Chandler Bing,How about to the street say from the balcony?
Chandler Bing,Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Chandler Bing,How about the closet by the bathroom?
Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. It's locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh y'know, I've been living here a while and I've never seen what's inside that closet. What is, what is in there?"
Chandler Bing,Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Chandler Bing,Fine.
Chandler Bing,Love you.
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. If! I said, ""If it helps!"""
Chandler Bing,I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!
Chandler Bing,Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.
Chandler Bing,I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
Chandler Bing,Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Chandler Bing,And here we go...
Chandler Bing,There has got to be a way!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl."
Chandler Bing,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Chandler Bing,"So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?"
Chandler Bing,That's a good idea.
Chandler Bing,"Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?"
Chandler Bing,"Not to shabby, I got this all off myself...using my wife's tools. Oh my God!"
Chandler Bing,You're messy.
Chandler Bing,I married Fred Sanford!
Chandler Bing,"No, honey you're not sick! Look, I don't love you because you're organized, I love you in spite of that."
Chandler Bing,"Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Chandler Bing,Are you okay?
Chandler Bing,Happy Valentine's!
Chandler Bing,'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
Chandler Bing,"I love you, St. Valentine."
Chandler Bing,"Woah, woah, that's not pretty!"
Chandler Bing,Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
Chandler Bing,I am trying!
Chandler Bing,Why did you get me this?
Chandler Bing,"It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating..."
Chandler Bing,I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now."
Chandler Bing,"Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?"
Chandler Bing,How long it took to go back in the water?
Chandler Bing,You don't know. You didn't see it.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?"
Chandler Bing,"See, honey, there's-"
Chandler Bing,90 seconds.
Chandler Bing,"You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!"
Chandler Bing,I can do that.
Chandler Bing,Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I know!"
Chandler Bing,Poor Ross.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it."
Chandler Bing,"Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
Chandler Bing,"This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go."
Chandler Bing,Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Chandler Bing,"Wait, you guys, look!"
Chandler Bing,"No, the baby's out! Look, look!"
Chandler Bing,And look how happy the mom is now!
Chandler Bing,Oh! She's growing inside you.
Chandler Bing,Oh!
Chandler Bing,I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Chandler Bing,Oh hey!
Chandler Bing,"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?"
Chandler Bing,"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!"
Chandler Bing,"Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about."
Chandler Bing,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecue chicken pizza? No?
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?!
Chandler Bing,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
Chandler Bing,"Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?"
Chandler Bing,"Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too."
Chandler Bing,Is it made of cheese?
Chandler Bing,Oh come on! Are you listening to this?
Chandler Bing,What do we do?
Chandler Bing,"Sure, why don't you set it up. I'll just be over here, browsing through the personals."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough."
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, did you say cheese?"
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese."
Chandler Bing,No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.
Chandler Bing,You don't?
Chandler Bing,So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Chandler Bing,I love you.
Chandler Bing,Y'know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers. No? Really? They taste so good.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I don't see him. Do you see him?
Chandler Bing,What?! No! No!
Chandler Bing,"I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!"""
Chandler Bing,We didn't play it!!
Chandler Bing,I didn't know you read tea leaves.
Chandler Bing,What does yours say Pheebs?
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's."
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?"
Chandler Bing,"I know it's tough now, but things will get better."
Chandler Bing,"I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?"
Chandler Bing,Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
Chandler Bing,In the James Taylor case.
Chandler Bing,"Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case."
Chandler Bing,"Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y'know alphabetically or by genre?"
Chandler Bing,They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack."
Chandler Bing,What problem did you tell him you had?
Chandler Bing,The sun'll come out...tomorrow! Bet...your bottom dollar that tomorrow... ...there'll be sun.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,You can always sell your baby.
Chandler Bing,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business."
Chandler Bing,"Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?"
Chandler Bing,I'll be in there.
Chandler Bing,"Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?"
Chandler Bing,And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,It's a dog.
Chandler Bing,It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too."
Chandler Bing,Ha!
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,I don't think the flash went off.
Chandler Bing,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
Chandler Bing,What are you doin'?
Chandler Bing,"Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could ."
Chandler Bing,If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Chandler Bing,Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Chandler Bing,"No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this."
Chandler Bing,Nice work my friend.
Chandler Bing,And a bagel with only...
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?"
Chandler Bing,All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn."
Chandler Bing,"All right, ready?"
Chandler Bing,Two.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that's kinda a relief."
Chandler Bing,You wanna see if we still have it?
Chandler Bing,FREE PORN!!!
Chandler Bing,We have free porn here!!!
Chandler Bing,What's wrong with you?
Chandler Bing,This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you-Go to the doctor!
Chandler Bing,That's still in there?!
Chandler Bing,Stick to your side!
Chandler Bing,Mento?
Chandler Bing,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,Well this one's for you.
Chandler Bing,"No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds."
Chandler Bing,That's what they'll call us.
Chandler Bing,It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Chandler Bing,You're turning into a woman.
Chandler Bing,Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, introduce us!"
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
Chandler Bing,That's great.
Chandler Bing,You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
Chandler Bing,Bamboozled?
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!"
Chandler Bing,Bogota.
Chandler Bing,What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Chandler Bing,Higher or lower than what?
Chandler Bing,Can you believe how lame this is?
Chandler Bing,"This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath..."
Chandler Bing,Let me see that.
Chandler Bing,Triscadecaphobia.
Chandler Bing,Fear of Triscuts?
Chandler Bing,This game makes no sense!
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here."
Chandler Bing,Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
Chandler Bing,"Either, it makes no difference."
Chandler Bing,I'll take a card.
Chandler Bing,This game is kinda fun.
Chandler Bing,I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Chandler Bing,Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Chandler Bing,Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Chandler Bing,I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Chandler Bing,Six!
Chandler Bing,Hungry monkey.
Chandler Bing,Tell it to the Time Turtle!
Chandler Bing,Oh come on!!
Chandler Bing,I'd like a Google Card.
Chandler Bing,Yes! No! Google!
Chandler Bing,Nooo!!
Chandler Bing,This is the best game ever!!!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,I'm so sorry.
Chandler Bing,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Chandler Bing,"And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies."
Chandler Bing,That's what I do now.
Chandler Bing,"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?"
Chandler Bing,Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring."
Chandler Bing,"Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous."
Chandler Bing,Why not?
Chandler Bing,What about it?
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?!
Chandler Bing,What is it that I do?
Chandler Bing,Did you like me when we first met?
Chandler Bing,I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Chandler Bing,"Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks."
Chandler Bing,An hour.
Chandler Bing,Phoebe!
Chandler Bing,Chandler Bing.
Chandler Bing,"Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out."
Chandler Bing,"...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating."
Chandler Bing,"What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me."
Chandler Bing,Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Chandler Bing,Oh!
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
Chandler Bing,That I did. That I did.
Chandler Bing,My duties? All right.
Chandler Bing,I see.
Chandler Bing,Good to know.
Chandler Bing,No don't I beg of you!
Chandler Bing,Really?!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo."
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!"
Chandler Bing,I'll look forward to your call.
Chandler Bing,Let's.
Chandler Bing,Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Chandler Bing,"He's not snoozing, he's teaching a class."
Chandler Bing,I haven't seen this dress.
Chandler Bing,You really want to take me?
Chandler Bing,So you're never actually going to pay me back?
Chandler Bing,I always knew you were gonna make it. I'm so proud of you.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah well, I'm gonna go spit."
Chandler Bing,This is so exciting! It's so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,It's just so glamorous.
Chandler Bing,Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Chandler Bing,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah!"
Chandler Bing,The whole thing! Can we go?
Chandler Bing,"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
Chandler Bing,I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Chandler Bing,"Don't go! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or, call an ambulance."
Chandler Bing,Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Chandler Bing,I'm so sorry.
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,"You don't owe me anything, I don't want you money..."
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, five hundred dollars?"
Chandler Bing,"Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots."
Chandler Bing,Do you want a calculator?
Chandler Bing,Here!
Chandler Bing,"Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes..."
Chandler Bing,Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, money well spent!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food..."
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner."
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready."
Chandler Bing,But you said you were ready too.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?"
Chandler Bing,I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
Chandler Bing,"Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good."
Chandler Bing,But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Chandler Bing,What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
Chandler Bing,I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
Chandler Bing,"We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?"
Chandler Bing,Period math?
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Right here?
Chandler Bing,"Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine."
Chandler Bing,Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
Chandler Bing,"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
Chandler Bing,"If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!"
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
Chandler Bing,Jan-Janice!
Chandler Bing,Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
Chandler Bing,What?!
Chandler Bing,That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Chandler Bing,"It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is."
Chandler Bing,"So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?"
Chandler Bing,So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Chandler Bing,You do?
Chandler Bing,"Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,That was amazing.
Chandler Bing,"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
Chandler Bing,He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Chandler Bing,Okay. Wow.
Chandler Bing,Sure.
Chandler Bing,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Chandler Bing,What?! Why does she think that?
Chandler Bing,"Again, what?!"
Chandler Bing,As we all are at some point during the day.
Chandler Bing,Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Chandler Bing,And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
Chandler Bing,"Well, what did she say?"
Chandler Bing,Does Ross know?
Chandler Bing,Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
Chandler Bing,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
Chandler Bing,"Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way."
Chandler Bing,"I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay."
Chandler Bing,"Hello sir, you know Monica."
Chandler Bing,"Look, we can't stay in here forever."
Chandler Bing,"This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door."
Chandler Bing,"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun."
Chandler Bing,"Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want."
Chandler Bing,"That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head."
Chandler Bing,"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall."
Chandler Bing,You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?
Chandler Bing,"Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!"
Chandler Bing,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, look, just do it gently."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Yea yea.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?"
Chandler Bing,"Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
Chandler Bing,Walter .
Chandler Bing,Yep.
Chandler Bing,Yes.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Chandler Bing,Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing.
Chandler Bing,"Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?"
Chandler Bing,People who've never ever been to Paris.
Chandler Bing,We're moving to Tulsa!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes."
Chandler Bing,"The Sooner State, whatever that is."
Chandler Bing,Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Chandler Bing,"No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. I'll get out of it."
Chandler Bing,What is wrong with Emma?
Chandler Bing,"Umm ma'am, do you have a minute? I kind of have some bad news. I don't think I can move to Tulsa."
Chandler Bing,"It's a funny story, actually. I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I'd move to Tulsa, I didn't really know what I was saying."
Chandler Bing,"But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain't that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here's the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won't go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy-Please don't make me go there!"
Chandler Bing,"No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! That's a picture of your daughter, isn't it, well she's lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I'll call you from Tulsa."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Oh so there can't be any yelling.
Chandler Bing,We're moving to Tulsa.
Chandler Bing,"Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! I can't, I can't hear you."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, what you guys talking about?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated."
Chandler Bing,They said it could be up to a year.
Chandler Bing,"There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I've got good news!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job."
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you said that without gagging!"
Chandler Bing,I know what she's talking about.
Chandler Bing,He saw a therapist?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Chandler Bing,Slim Pickings.
Chandler Bing,"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite."
Chandler Bing,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Chandler Bing,Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Chandler Bing,"Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,How far outside?
Chandler Bing,"And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job."
Chandler Bing,What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
Chandler Bing,I think you should take the job.
Chandler Bing,Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
Chandler Bing,Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Chandler Bing,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
Chandler Bing,That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Chandler Bing,"Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy."
Chandler Bing,Of course I will call you. I love you.
Chandler Bing,Awww. Bye!
Chandler Bing,What's the matter Joe?
Chandler Bing,Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
Chandler Bing,"Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!"
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,I know that too.
Chandler Bing,"Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise."
Chandler Bing,"Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, STOP IT! Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas? 7 o clock maybe I'll hit the gym who am I kidding pay-per-view porn. -Cuts to Monica."
Chandler Bing,DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:

Chandler Bing,does what always have to be sharks.
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,let ME be a part of this!
Chandler Bing,no they don't.
Chandler Bing,"OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn."
Chandler Bing,yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
Chandler Bing,"You are an amazing wife. No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that."
Chandler Bing,"Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? Yes, Ken is it?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let's get started, by take a look at last quarter's figures. Ah, Claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass?"
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can't remember why. You're not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?"
Chandler Bing,"Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine. So you all smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not."
Chandler Bing,"Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me."
Chandler Bing,"I always liked you, Ken."
Chandler Bing,"Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people."
Chandler Bing,"No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos."
Chandler Bing,"Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?"
Chandler Bing,Pheebs?
Chandler Bing,"Okay, something to cover the smell ... Oven cleaner! Unscented!"
Chandler Bing,"No thanks, I'm good."
Chandler Bing,"Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower."
Chandler Bing,"Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonna smoke anymore."
Chandler Bing,"But, those are for you."
Chandler Bing,"I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
Chandler Bing,Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off.
Chandler Bing,"'kay, look: Can we just drop this? I'm not gonna smoke again."
Chandler Bing,You forbid me?
Chandler Bing,"You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
Chandler Bing,"Then, I might as well ... do this . Not really sure what to do now."
Chandler Bing,Fine. What!?
Chandler Bing,You serious?
Chandler Bing,"Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking."
Chandler Bing,And no kissing your neck.
Chandler Bing,And lots of kissing your neck.
Chandler Bing,"Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way."
Chandler Bing,"That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
Chandler Bing,Mean it?
Chandler Bing,"You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, let's celebrate life!"
Chandler Bing,Uhh. You are welcome.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.
Chandler Bing,Leave it.
Chandler Bing,You tricked me to get me into bed?
Chandler Bing,I feel so used.
Chandler Bing,I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Chandler Bing,I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.
Chandler Bing,You mean the lully story?
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
Chandler Bing,You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Chandler Bing,What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?
Chandler Bing,Mhum.
Chandler Bing,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
Chandler Bing,Hello? Hello?
Chandler Bing,"Honey, you're screaming."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's great."
Chandler Bing,Awesome.
Chandler Bing,"Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch."
Chandler Bing,And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Chandler Bing,"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he came up..."
Chandler Bing,Were you there?
Chandler Bing,"Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks."
Chandler Bing,"Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it."
Chandler Bing,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
Chandler Bing,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Chandler Bing,Yeah!
Chandler Bing,Ye....
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,What are you guys talking about?
Chandler Bing,You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Chandler Bing,"You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse."
Chandler Bing,"If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza."
Chandler Bing,What is so funny about that?
Chandler Bing,Did you tell her what we talked about?
Chandler Bing,So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Chandler Bing,"I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
Chandler Bing,"Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
Chandler Bing,I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.
Chandler Bing,See ya!
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,How come?
Chandler Bing,Do you have any ideas?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face."
Chandler Bing,So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Chandler Bing,mmm That's enough about you!
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple."
Chandler Bing,"We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?"
Chandler Bing,"Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!"
Chandler Bing,There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Chandler Bing,Get there faster!
Chandler Bing,"I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it."
Chandler Bing,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
Chandler Bing,"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?"
Chandler Bing,Some girl...!?
Chandler Bing,Yeah...!?
Chandler Bing,"Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?"
Chandler Bing,Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Chandler Bing,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?"
Chandler Bing,Why am I hearing cheering?
Chandler Bing,Football? Just football?
Chandler Bing,It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?
Chandler Bing,Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Chandler Bing,"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches."
Chandler Bing,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends."
Chandler Bing,What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Chandler Bing,Is that a problem?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?"
Chandler Bing,"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint."
Chandler Bing,What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Chandler Bing,I will explain it to her.
Chandler Bing,Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
Chandler Bing,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
Chandler Bing,What are you going to do?
Chandler Bing,Well you proved them wrong.
Chandler Bing,"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,"Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?"
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Chandler Bing,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two...."
Chandler Bing,"No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"
Chandler Bing,Actually what?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?"
Chandler Bing,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Chandler Bing,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?"
Chandler Bing,Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.
Chandler Bing,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?"
Chandler Bing,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?"
Chandler Bing,You said that to me last week.
Chandler Bing,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you."
Chandler Bing,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now."
Chandler Bing,Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
Chandler Bing,"By the way, that fight was totally arousing."
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first."
Chandler Bing,Nope...
Chandler Bing,Yep...
Chandler Bing,"Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time."
Chandler Bing,Maybe not even then.
Chandler Bing,Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?
Chandler Bing,Chandler Bing.
Chandler Bing,What's up Joe?
Chandler Bing,Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
Chandler Bing,Courtside? Oh my God.
Chandler Bing,That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.
Chandler Bing,Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Chandler Bing,"But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you."
Chandler Bing,"I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something."
Chandler Bing,"Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it."
Chandler Bing,All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.
Chandler Bing,"Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here."
Chandler Bing,I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Chandler Bing,It's huge.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're forgetting about the time difference."
Chandler Bing,"That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop."
Chandler Bing,Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Chandler Bing,What is he doing?
Chandler Bing,"All right. Well, I'll check the guest room."
Chandler Bing,There's nobody here Joe.
Chandler Bing,I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand."
Chandler Bing,Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Really? You're gonna be okay?
Chandler Bing,"You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, bye."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid."
Chandler Bing,Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Chandler Bing,"Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
Chandler Bing,"So, who does?"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I won't be here."
Chandler Bing,Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
Chandler Bing,Did I not mention that?
Chandler Bing,AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*
Chandler Bing,"All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call for writing ""Screw you, Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Hey. Where've you been?
Chandler Bing,"You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order."
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
Chandler Bing,"Haha, no thanks!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
Chandler Bing,"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional..."
Chandler Bing,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
Chandler Bing,What? That's terrible!
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
Chandler Bing,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
Chandler Bing,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
Chandler Bing,"If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
Chandler Bing,"OK, Pheebs, your turn."
Chandler Bing,"And, a lemon lime."
Chandler Bing,And last but not least.
Chandler Bing,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Chandler Bing,"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
Chandler Bing,Santa? Really?
Chandler Bing,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Chandler Bing,Then it's okaaay!
Chandler Bing,"You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve."
Chandler Bing,"Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go."
Chandler Bing,"Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?"
Chandler Bing,Ah. Thanks.
Chandler Bing,Ah. Chandler Bing.
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!"
Chandler Bing,"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
Chandler Bing,It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Chandler Bing,I sent them home.
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, uh..."
Chandler Bing,I don't know!
Chandler Bing,"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
Chandler Bing,BE-LOW me!
Chandler Bing,"Well, she... she didn't win..."
Chandler Bing,"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
Chandler Bing,"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
Chandler Bing,I'm serious!
Chandler Bing,Merry Christmas.
Chandler Bing,"Merry Christmas, you guys!"
Chandler Bing,"The wife says ""Hi!""."
Chandler Bing,"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
Chandler Bing,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
Chandler Bing,"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!"
Chandler Bing,I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Chandler Bing,"No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!"
Chandler Bing,I'm *happily* married.
Chandler Bing,"Right. So, I'm sorry..."
Chandler Bing,"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
Chandler Bing,"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
Chandler Bing,You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Chandler Bing,But we don't do that.
Chandler Bing,How drunk are you?
Chandler Bing,That's the perfect amount!
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?"
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Chandler Bing,Yep!
Chandler Bing,Count of three?
Chandler Bing,Two!
Chandler Bing,Three!
Chandler Bing,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Chandler Bing,Eh!
Chandler Bing,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
Chandler Bing,"Really? Okay, so..."
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
Chandler Bing,Right!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new."
Chandler Bing,Let's go!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
Chandler Bing,I don't think so.
Chandler Bing,Here just...take this.
Chandler Bing,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, one thing at a time."
Chandler Bing,Ehh.
Chandler Bing,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
Chandler Bing,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
Chandler Bing,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
Chandler Bing,Sure you do.
Chandler Bing,You sure?
Chandler Bing,I love you so much.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Chandler Bing,Monica.
Chandler Bing,I never want to leave you again!
Chandler Bing,Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
Chandler Bing,I have *not* thought this through!
Chandler Bing,"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
Chandler Bing,Thanks!
Chandler Bing,Ahh...
Chandler Bing,"Here, pass these, will ya.."
Chandler Bing,"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
Chandler Bing,I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*
Chandler Bing,"Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Chandler Bing,"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
Chandler Bing,But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Chandler Bing,Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Chandler Bing,How long was I in there?
Chandler Bing,Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Chandler Bing,"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though."
Chandler Bing,"I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
Chandler Bing,Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Chandler Bing,"""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
Chandler Bing,"No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."""
Chandler Bing,Really? That's great!
Chandler Bing,"It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
Chandler Bing,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now."
Chandler Bing,"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Ross is here so..."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits."
Chandler Bing,"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant."
Chandler Bing,That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Chandler Bing,Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Chandler Bing,"That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
Chandler Bing,Or a year?
Chandler Bing,"It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" It'll probably be more than a year."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back."
Chandler Bing,I quit and you learn what I do?
Chandler Bing,I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Chandler Bing,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
Chandler Bing,"I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping."
Chandler Bing,Hey! Happy birthday ...
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
Chandler Bing,Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Chandler Bing,Now that Rachel's gone?
Chandler Bing,I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Chandler Bing,Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Chandler Bing,"Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma."
Chandler Bing,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
Chandler Bing,You don't trust him?
Chandler Bing,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now."
Chandler Bing,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it."
Chandler Bing,Picturing that tree?
Chandler Bing,"Where you going, Joe?"
Chandler Bing,Oh. You mind if I join you?
Chandler Bing,Your thoughts? Plural?
Chandler Bing,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
Chandler Bing,Great novels?
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I got a little occupied."
Chandler Bing,"Right behind you, big guy!"
Chandler Bing,Come on! Joe!
Chandler Bing,"First I was afraid, I was petrified."
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said""No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there."" And I said ""Maybe if we put some light out there they will"""
Chandler Bing,So are you gonna...talk to her?
Chandler Bing,"You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
Chandler Bing,No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Chandler Bing,"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!"
Chandler Bing,Why did I get married?!
Chandler Bing,Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Chandler Bing,"Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself...."
Chandler Bing,What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Chandler Bing,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing."
Chandler Bing,Did she go out with him?
Chandler Bing,Ah! The high road...
Chandler Bing,Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Chandler Bing,I thought I had to make the jokes!
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!"
Chandler Bing,We still got it!
Chandler Bing,"I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed."
Chandler Bing,By drowning or...?!
Chandler Bing,Well...
Chandler Bing,"Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?"
Chandler Bing,"I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!"
Chandler Bing,It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Chandler Bing,"Ok. First of all, this is green!"
Chandler Bing,"All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his ""business"" partners."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch."
Chandler Bing,And done!
Chandler Bing,Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate."
Chandler Bing,No problem.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
Chandler Bing,Really? In front of all this people?
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,Are those my wife's nipples?
Chandler Bing,I gotta stop this.
Chandler Bing,"You, touching yourself, out!"
Chandler Bing,"""Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine."" So you just touch yourself for anything?"
Chandler Bing,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
Chandler Bing,Wow.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
Chandler Bing,Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Chandler Bing,"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!"
Chandler Bing,I don't do that.
Chandler Bing,"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?"
Chandler Bing,Today is the sixth.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, it's also 2003."
Chandler Bing,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Chandler Bing,Tough crib.
Chandler Bing,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Chandler Bing,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not."
Chandler Bing,I - I don't think I can.
Chandler Bing,Because of Emma.
Chandler Bing,Sorry.
Chandler Bing,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y."
Chandler Bing,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Chandler Bing,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window."
Chandler Bing,Emma was doing it!
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
Chandler Bing,I think we may have really done it this time.
Chandler Bing,You may wanna get some more of those too.
Chandler Bing,Where's Emma?
Chandler Bing,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no."
Chandler Bing,What? Why?
Chandler Bing,Your family name is Tribbiani.
Chandler Bing,"Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what."
Chandler Bing,Thank you. I got a job in advertising.
Chandler Bing,"Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship."
Chandler Bing,"Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you."
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating."
Chandler Bing,Humiliating and noble!
Chandler Bing,"Good morning, everybody."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
Chandler Bing,"Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope."
Chandler Bing,The comedian? USO?!
Chandler Bing,"Honey, I'm old!"
Chandler Bing,I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these."
Chandler Bing,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Chandler Bing,What am I supposed to do with these?
Chandler Bing,"Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?"
Chandler Bing,"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for."
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything."
Chandler Bing,"Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!"
Chandler Bing,You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Chandler Bing,Alright I feel youger already!
Chandler Bing,"Yah, I think I broke my hip."
Chandler Bing,Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.
Chandler Bing,"A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!"""
Chandler Bing,"Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me."
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow."
Chandler Bing,The cold weather hurts my hip!
Chandler Bing,Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Chandler Bing,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron."
Chandler Bing,Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Chandler Bing,You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Chandler Bing,No! We're not borrowing money.
Chandler Bing,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Chandler Bing,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Chandler Bing,Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
Chandler Bing,Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Chandler Bing,Yes dear.
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe!
Chandler Bing,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Chandler Bing,And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Chandler Bing,What? What do you mean you know?
Chandler Bing,Oh! Right.
Chandler Bing,"Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money."
Chandler Bing,Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!
Chandler Bing,Oh ok.
Chandler Bing,I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Chandler Bing,Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Chandler Bing,Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Chandler Bing,"No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form."
Chandler Bing,"Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
Chandler Bing,"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that."
Chandler Bing,Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Chandler Bing,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,But honey you don't have to.
Chandler Bing,Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Chandler Bing,your ass?!?!?
Chandler Bing,They...do that?
Chandler Bing,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Chandler Bing,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,It's over/Joe!
Chandler Bing,"Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky."
Chandler Bing,Aaaaand....... hernia.
Chandler Bing,Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Chandler Bing,"Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you."
Chandler Bing,Hey! Ready to go?
Chandler Bing,What are you doin'?
Chandler Bing,"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
Chandler Bing,The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Chandler Bing,Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Chandler Bing,"Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "" You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!"
Chandler Bing,"Maybe we finish this for him! ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm so sorry!"
Chandler Bing,You're not gonna need my help?
Chandler Bing,"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth."
Chandler Bing,I believe I read that somewhere!
Chandler Bing,I respectfully disagree.
Chandler Bing,Who cares? Nobody reads those things.
Chandler Bing,I don't have a page.
Chandler Bing,Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Chandler Bing,Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Chandler Bing,"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go ."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you'll see my friend."
Chandler Bing,And so young.
Chandler Bing,"Well, how you died was funny."
Chandler Bing,It kills over one americans every year.
Chandler Bing,You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?"
Chandler Bing,Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Chandler Bing,"No, come on, you know that's not true."
Chandler Bing,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
Chandler Bing,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
Chandler Bing,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
Chandler Bing,"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?"
Chandler Bing,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
Chandler Bing,There you go! Someone came!
Chandler Bing,"Please, come in."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
Chandler Bing,At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.
Chandler Bing,"Some guy, Tom Gordon."
Chandler Bing,"Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!"
Chandler Bing,Ok!
Chandler Bing,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
Chandler Bing,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
Chandler Bing,"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide."
Chandler Bing,Kori? Kori Weston?
Chandler Bing,Wow! You look amazing!
Chandler Bing,"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
Chandler Bing,"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!"
Chandler Bing,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Chandler Bing,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!"
Chandler Bing,Still on Amelia Earhart?
Chandler Bing,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
Chandler Bing,I'll ask. Boohaki?
Chandler Bing,Kinda like Joey.
Chandler Bing,Pie eating contest?
Chandler Bing,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
Chandler Bing,"Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!"
Chandler Bing,"Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?"
Chandler Bing,Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
Chandler Bing,One of the slots got filled.
Chandler Bing,Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Chandler Bing,Yeah I know.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie."
Chandler Bing,"Please, just do it!"
Chandler Bing,"I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
Chandler Bing,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
Chandler Bing,Ooh! Calm down ...
Chandler Bing,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
Chandler Bing,"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
Chandler Bing,I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?
Chandler Bing,"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye."
Chandler Bing,"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
Chandler Bing,He's the boss's son.
Chandler Bing,What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Chandler Bing,"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago."
Chandler Bing,"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
Chandler Bing,"She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ..."
Chandler Bing,"Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!"
Chandler Bing,"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
Chandler Bing,Friends!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!"
Chandler Bing,"Ok, here we go!"
Chandler Bing,This is..shhh!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?"
Chandler Bing,I got that!
Chandler Bing,No.
Chandler Bing,"Ah, the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve."
Chandler Bing,"Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
Chandler Bing,"Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
Chandler Bing,"Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow ."
Chandler Bing,"What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter."
Chandler Bing,Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Chandler Bing,"Thanks, man."
Chandler Bing,Really? What?
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out."
Chandler Bing,"Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
Chandler Bing,Me too.
Chandler Bing,"What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !"
Chandler Bing,"So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?"
Chandler Bing,Are you really that busy?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. ""Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"""
Chandler Bing,"""Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?"" ""Oh, thank you very much!"" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont..."
Chandler Bing,I don't have travel insurance.
Chandler Bing,"Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
Chandler Bing,New York.
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
Chandler Bing,"Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
Chandler Bing,Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Chandler Bing,That's insane!
Chandler Bing,Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
Chandler Bing,What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Chandler Bing,"Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
Chandler Bing,"Dude, you're shaking!"
Chandler Bing,USA Today.
Chandler Bing,And I also got... two more apples.
Chandler Bing,I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Chandler Bing,"I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, how about this ?"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!"
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
Chandler Bing,There's a forest right outside.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!"
Chandler Bing,I got you something from Vermont!
Chandler Bing,"Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV."
Chandler Bing,I could fall asleep at a play.
Chandler Bing,"Uh, let's see, who do I hate?"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
Chandler Bing,"No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now."
Chandler Bing,Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
Chandler Bing,"oh yes, God yes!!"
Chandler Bing,I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Chandler Bing,Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted."
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
Chandler Bing,Did somebody sign your bra?
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."
Chandler Bing,"Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death ."
Chandler Bing,"I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?"
Chandler Bing,"So, a professor, uh?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
Chandler Bing,We really need to take those tests?
Chandler Bing,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Chandler Bing,It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Chandler Bing,"I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!"
Chandler Bing,I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Chandler Bing,"Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I guess!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, Come on!"
Chandler Bing,Why are you here?
Chandler Bing,"No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??"
Chandler Bing,What!?
Chandler Bing,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date..."
Chandler Bing,I think it just fell off.
Chandler Bing,My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
Chandler Bing,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Chandler Bing,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?"
Chandler Bing,"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'..."
Chandler Bing,"It was a ""Wendy's!! """
Chandler Bing,It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Chandler Bing,"Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks."
Chandler Bing,Doctor Connelly just called.
Chandler Bing,Actually it's both of us.
Chandler Bing,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
Chandler Bing,It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
Chandler Bing,"It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us."
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing,"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
Chandler Bing,Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
Chandler Bing,Hi.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, DAMN IT!"
Chandler Bing,"Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!"
Chandler Bing,Hey guys!
Chandler Bing,"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
Chandler Bing,But you come first!
Chandler Bing,Ok.
Chandler Bing,Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Chandler Bing,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
Chandler Bing,ah-ha!
Chandler Bing,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
Chandler Bing,"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer."
Chandler Bing,"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?"
Chandler Bing,"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
Chandler Bing,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
Chandler Bing,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
Chandler Bing,Ok!
Chandler Bing,Zack!
Chandler Bing,"So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
Chandler Bing,You don't like him.
Chandler Bing,Alright! Just follow my lead!
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
Chandler Bing,That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Chandler Bing,You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.
Chandler Bing,Sure! Alright...
Chandler Bing,I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Chandler Bing,We're teeth people Zack!
Chandler Bing,You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Chandler Bing,"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
Chandler Bing,Ok.
Chandler Bing,I think we've found our sperm!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?"
Chandler Bing,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he's better!"
Chandler Bing,Really? Are you sure?
Chandler Bing,"Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm."
Chandler Bing,So you know this leaves us with...
Chandler Bing,How do you feel about that?
Chandler Bing,Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,We are gonna be great parents.
Chandler Bing,"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Zack!"
Chandler Bing,"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."
Chandler Bing,"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
Chandler Bing,She does?
Chandler Bing,I wouldn't read too much into it.
Chandler Bing,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
Chandler Bing,"Seriously, we're gonna do this?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?"
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,I didn't mean now...
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help."
Chandler Bing,"David, I'm pretending to read here!!"
Chandler Bing,"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" ""I do""."
Chandler Bing,David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Chandler Bing,"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
Chandler Bing,"I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?"
Chandler Bing,"Man, that's some bad advice!"
Chandler Bing,That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Chandler Bing,"Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!"
Chandler Bing,Nice!
Chandler Bing,"Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?"
Chandler Bing,David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Chandler Bing,That would be advice!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?"
Chandler Bing,What? May I?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!"
Chandler Bing,"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"
Chandler Bing,It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Chandler Bing,Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Chandler Bing,"Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!"
Chandler Bing,Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Chandler Bing,"It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
Chandler Bing,I just feel awful.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but... you know, you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her..."
Chandler Bing,"Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!"
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!"
Chandler Bing,And there's not chance that will work?
Chandler Bing,Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Chandler Bing,This vacation sucks!!
Chandler Bing,"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
Chandler Bing,"I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!"
Chandler Bing,"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."
Chandler Bing,I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Chandler Bing,Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Chandler Bing,Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Chandler Bing,Not to mention the cold sores.
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,I don't think so!
Chandler Bing,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?"
Chandler Bing,And...?
Chandler Bing,I'm not playing with you.
Chandler Bing,She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
Chandler Bing,"Oh dear God, there's two of them!"
Chandler Bing,Did you know this about him?
Chandler Bing,OK!
Chandler Bing,"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
Chandler Bing,Do you really find this attractive on him?
Chandler Bing,I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Chandler Bing,"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."
Chandler Bing,Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Chandler Bing,"Ok, look! Enough is enough!"
Chandler Bing,"Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
Chandler Bing,But...
Chandler Bing,What about the obsessive cleaning?
Chandler Bing,You ok?
Chandler Bing,"No, you didn't."
Chandler Bing,Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Chandler Bing,"Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you."
Chandler Bing,"You're welcome, sweetheart."
Chandler Bing,"All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."
Chandler Bing,And that's... how... it's done!
Chandler Bing,"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
Chandler Bing,I don't know.
Chandler Bing,That's why!
Chandler Bing,"You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired."
Chandler Bing,You're on!
Chandler Bing,"He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
Chandler Bing,She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Chandler Bing,Wow!
Chandler Bing,How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Chandler Bing,Anything?
Chandler Bing,You do realise that's your brother?
Chandler Bing,That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Chandler Bing,Okay Buckwheat!
Chandler Bing,And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Chandler Bing,Bye!
Chandler Bing,He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Chandler Bing,You got it!
Chandler Bing,YE-AH!
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?"
Chandler Bing,Enunciate!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing."
Chandler Bing,"You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
Chandler Bing,Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Chandler Bing,I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Chandler Bing,What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life."
Chandler Bing,Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Chandler Bing,"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
Chandler Bing,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
Chandler Bing,What are you singing?
Chandler Bing,"It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!"
Chandler Bing,Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
Chandler Bing,"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
Chandler Bing,Hit yourself in the tooth?
Chandler Bing,"Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?"
Chandler Bing,Really? What happened?
Chandler Bing,You can't move at all?
Chandler Bing,"If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?"
Chandler Bing,Some of these look a little frayed.
Chandler Bing,"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?"
Chandler Bing,I think you know.
Chandler Bing,This is what I want to do.
Chandler Bing,"She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant."
Chandler Bing,There's a hair in my coffee.
Chandler Bing,"You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
Chandler Bing,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"I mean, you have a lovely home."
Chandler Bing,That's great. Can I see the book?
Chandler Bing,"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you must be Owen."
Chandler Bing,"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
Chandler Bing,You know how to use a compass?
Chandler Bing,You do? That's fantastic!
Chandler Bing,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,I got nothing.
Chandler Bing,Where are Bill and Colleen?
Chandler Bing,We have to leave!!
Chandler Bing,"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him."
Chandler Bing,But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
Chandler Bing,See? Intuitive!
Chandler Bing,Which technically now you should give back!
Chandler Bing,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."""
Chandler Bing,"We have to get out of here, baby!"
Chandler Bing,"Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?"
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
Chandler Bing,"So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?"
Chandler Bing,Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Chandler Bing,What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Chandler Bing,How can you be so confident?
Chandler Bing,Really? Like you have a routine?
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,You mean like this?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice."
Chandler Bing,...and beer!!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Chandler Bing,She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Chandler Bing,Why...why?
Chandler Bing,"Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
Chandler Bing,Hey Pheebs!
Chandler Bing,Who's Amanda?
Chandler Bing,Are you trying to do a British accent?
Chandler Bing,"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?"
Chandler Bing,"No, had it done to me though. Feels good !"
Chandler Bing,Hello? Is someone on the line?
Chandler Bing,"Hang on, she's right here. Someone's on the phone, for ya."
Chandler Bing,I get pedicures!
Chandler Bing,Hold on! There is something different.
Chandler Bing,Was that place... The Sun?
Chandler Bing,Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Chandler Bing,How was your date with Joey?
Chandler Bing,You didn't like that?
Chandler Bing,You don't know!
Chandler Bing,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, aren't you a treat."
Chandler Bing,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!"
Chandler Bing,"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
Chandler Bing,"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
Chandler Bing,"I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy."
Chandler Bing,"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in."
Chandler Bing,"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in."
Chandler Bing,"No, I just had to get a picture of this."
Chandler Bing,I see you later! end.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend."
Chandler Bing,Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Chandler Bing,There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Chandler Bing,"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party..."
Chandler Bing,Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening."
Chandler Bing,"I know, what are we gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Chandler Bing,I was not ready for this today!
Chandler Bing,To be fair this one does have nuts.
Chandler Bing,Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Chandler Bing,"We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday."
Chandler Bing,Was that Emma? Is she up?
Chandler Bing,I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Chandler Bing,To the bathroom!
Chandler Bing,What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
Chandler Bing,"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?"
Chandler Bing,I'm begging you stop.
Chandler Bing,That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Chandler Bing,Thats a bear.
Chandler Bing,"Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!"
Chandler Bing,I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Chandler Bing,They left.
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?"
Chandler Bing,"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little."
Chandler Bing,Ooh! That's my girl!
Chandler Bing,Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Chandler Bing,Me too...
Chandler Bing,There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Chandler Bing,I was kidding.
Chandler Bing,"No, not yet."
Chandler Bing,"Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did."
Chandler Bing,"Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?"
Chandler Bing,"Let's do it, come on!"
Chandler Bing,Thanks!
Chandler Bing,"Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
Chandler Bing,So excited about your letter!
Chandler Bing,So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Chandler Bing,That's where people make number two!!
Chandler Bing,I don't... uh... understand.
Chandler Bing,On every word?
Chandler Bing,And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Chandler Bing,"You know what? You don't need a thesaurus, just write from here, your full sized aortic pump."
Chandler Bing,I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Chandler Bing,Word!
Chandler Bing,She's right! If I were a guy and... Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
Chandler Bing,Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Chandler Bing,Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Chandler Bing,"It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter."
Chandler Bing,"Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. ."
Chandler Bing,They loved it.
Chandler Bing,They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
Chandler Bing,"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings."
Chandler Bing,That sounds like fun.
Chandler Bing,I think she looks cute. ... but I am wrong!
Chandler Bing,Hi Ross.
Chandler Bing,Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Chandler Bing,Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it."
Chandler Bing,Hey honey!
Chandler Bing,Is Monica not here?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part."
Chandler Bing,"First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor."
Chandler Bing,Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
Chandler Bing,Hey you guys.
Chandler Bing,"Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part."
Chandler Bing,Joe...
Chandler Bing,Fine!
Chandler Bing,"Work, Joe!"
Chandler Bing,What am I gonna do now?
Chandler Bing,"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!"
Chandler Bing,"That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! ."
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe!
Chandler Bing,Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry man.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!"
Chandler Bing,What!? Of course I did!
Chandler Bing,"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!"
Chandler Bing,I watched it!
Chandler Bing,I did!
Chandler Bing,"I'm telling you, I watched the tape."
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Chandler Bing,What did I just say?
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something..."
Chandler Bing,Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Chandler Bing,He really is a chameleon.
Chandler Bing,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not."
Chandler Bing,I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Chandler Bing,Lying is wrong!
Chandler Bing,I'm a pretty little girl.
Chandler Bing,"That's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers."
Chandler Bing,"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell."
Chandler Bing,Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Chandler Bing,You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Chandler Bing,Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Chandler Bing,Little people?
Chandler Bing,What...? NO!
Chandler Bing,"I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!"
Chandler Bing,"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine."
Chandler Bing,"Ok, ok, here we go."
Chandler Bing,Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
Chandler Bing,But you already gave all your money to charity!
Chandler Bing,I don't think you can do that!
Chandler Bing,"That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law."
Chandler Bing,"But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Of course it was!
Chandler Bing,RAT BASTARD!
Chandler Bing,"OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though."
Chandler Bing,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Chandler Bing,"Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls."
Chandler Bing,"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!"
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Chandler Bing,You can't make this stuff up!
Chandler Bing,Wrong number?
Chandler Bing,That's great!
Chandler Bing,Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Chandler Bing,Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us."
Chandler Bing,"No, no! We made this decision together."
Chandler Bing,Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Chandler Bing,We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Chandler Bing,Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Chandler Bing,"You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!"
Chandler Bing,Somebody is gonna pick us.
Chandler Bing,"I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!"
Chandler Bing,"""The Firm""?"
Chandler Bing,"You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year."
Chandler Bing,"I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile""."
Chandler Bing,Tell me more.
Chandler Bing,You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Hmm, the game's at one."
Chandler Bing,"Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
Chandler Bing,"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up."
Chandler Bing,"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
Chandler Bing,Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Chandler Bing,I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
Chandler Bing,They're out there!
Chandler Bing,"Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!"
Chandler Bing,Ross' shirt is torn.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?"
Chandler Bing,Oh thank God!
Chandler Bing,"That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand."
Chandler Bing,"Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it."
Chandler Bing,HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Chandler Bing,Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Chandler Bing,The cranberries...?
Chandler Bing,"He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!"
Chandler Bing,The floating heads do make a good point.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
Chandler Bing,That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Chandler Bing,A little late for that.
Chandler Bing,"Uhm, we've got turkey grease."
Chandler Bing,Can you ever feel your ears?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!"
Chandler Bing,"Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!"
Chandler Bing,"Come on guys, PUSH!"
Chandler Bing,PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
Chandler Bing,My cranberries!
Chandler Bing,Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Chandler Bing,Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Chandler Bing,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,And?
Chandler Bing,Are you serious?
Chandler Bing,That is the exact same thing.
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,"We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio."
Chandler Bing,And so incorrect!
Chandler Bing,"Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.."
Chandler Bing,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Chandler Bing,So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but..."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!"
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"""
Chandler Bing,You're gonna be great.
Chandler Bing,Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Chandler Bing,Ok.
Chandler Bing,That's what our friends call us.
Chandler Bing,I don't think that's exactly...
Chandler Bing,"So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?"
Chandler Bing,Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, wow."
Chandler Bing,No-ot for me it doesn't.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?"
Chandler Bing,You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I did."
Chandler Bing,We are NOT signing those papers.
Chandler Bing,It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Chandler Bing,You have gotta stop!
Chandler Bing,She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Chandler Bing,"Your Veal Chop is $34,95!"
Chandler Bing,But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Chandler Bing,I know..
Chandler Bing,"oh, honey.."
Chandler Bing,"Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to."
Chandler Bing,"So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
Chandler Bing,You're Jewish.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Chandler Bing,I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Chandler Bing,"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York."
Chandler Bing,Erica wait!
Chandler Bing,You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Chandler Bing,"Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising."
Chandler Bing,"But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?"
Chandler Bing,You still want that baby?
Chandler Bing,"Seriously, answer faster!"
Chandler Bing,It's like a giant hug.
Chandler Bing,Hello.
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
Chandler Bing,Those are all really old!
Chandler Bing,Hi!
Chandler Bing,I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Chandler Bing,"Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
Chandler Bing,It's perfect. It's everything we've been looking for.
Chandler Bing,And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? What were the things you said?
Chandler Bing,And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Chandler Bing,This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Chandler Bing,I don't know. What do you think?
Chandler Bing,I do too.
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy's car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day."
Chandler Bing,"We don't. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
Chandler Bing,I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
Chandler Bing,Yeah I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Chandler Bing,...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Chandler Bing,"Actually, we already found a house we love."
Chandler Bing,"Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE."
Chandler Bing,I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Chandler Bing,You know that's not the reason Joe.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
Chandler Bing,"If you win, we give up the birds."
Chandler Bing,"But if we win, we get your apartment."
Chandler Bing,Dangerous Liaisons.
Chandler Bing,Fancy.
Chandler Bing,Fancy guest.
Chandler Bing,Thanks man.
Chandler Bing,Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Chandler Bing,"Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
Chandler Bing,"Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,No problem roomie.
Chandler Bing,Sure!
Chandler Bing,"Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
Chandler Bing,"Here, here!"
Chandler Bing,"Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, thanks... They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price."
Chandler Bing,I know.
Chandler Bing,"That's okay, we understand."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then."
Chandler Bing,We got the house.
Chandler Bing,I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Chandler Bing,We're getting the house. We're getting the house.
Chandler Bing,We're growing up.
Chandler Bing,So who's gonna tell them?
Chandler Bing,Not it! Damn it!
Chandler Bing,You'll see.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house."
Chandler Bing,What did I marry into?
Chandler Bing,You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Chandler Bing,I'm leaving you.
Chandler Bing,Who?
Chandler Bing,Did I go to this school?
Chandler Bing,"Sure, nice."
Chandler Bing,"You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her."
Chandler Bing,Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Chandler Bing,"Awesome, the name really stands out."
Chandler Bing,"Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!"
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"You know, our band is playing on Friday."
Chandler Bing,Way!
Chandler Bing,Fresh!
Chandler Bing,Mint!
Chandler Bing,"I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out."
Chandler Bing,"I said it first, bro."
Chandler Bing,"Look, if you did..."
Chandler Bing,Totally. I had sex in High school...
Chandler Bing,"All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg."
Chandler Bing,"All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact."
Chandler Bing,Your hands are shaking.
Chandler Bing,Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Chandler Bing,"Ross, that was 16 years ago!"
Chandler Bing,"I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts."
Chandler Bing,Oh really?
Chandler Bing,Oh really!?
Chandler Bing,ADRIENNE TURNER!!
Chandler Bing,Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Chandler Bing,"Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her."
Chandler Bing,Really?
Chandler Bing,Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
Chandler Bing,Aren't you...?
Chandler Bing,Right. So how're you doing?
Chandler Bing,Hi Monica.
Chandler Bing,O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
Chandler Bing,"Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: ""Betrayal In The Common Room""."
Chandler Bing,Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Chandler Bing,Hmm mmmhm..
Chandler Bing,"Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?"
Chandler Bing,Not her!
Chandler Bing,Soo... you girls having fun?
Chandler Bing,Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Chandler Bing,"Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship."
Chandler Bing,So where are you applying to?
Chandler Bing,I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
Chandler Bing,Why?
Chandler Bing,You kissed her that night too?
Chandler Bing,"Seriously, where did this happen?"
Chandler Bing,Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Chandler Bing,I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Chandler Bing,"Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?"
Chandler Bing,What did I marry into?
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,"You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them."
Chandler Bing,No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Chandler Bing,You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Chandler Bing,Heh.
Chandler Bing,This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!
Chandler Bing,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,"I know, I hate being left out of things."
Chandler Bing,Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Chandler Bing,What happened?
Chandler Bing,M-Me-me-me!
Chandler Bing,"Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!"
Chandler Bing,You are going downer!
Chandler Bing,"I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!"
Chandler Bing,Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Chandler Bing,Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
Chandler Bing,"Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back."
Chandler Bing,"Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler."
Chandler Bing,How's it going?
Chandler Bing,That's what I was doing too.
Chandler Bing,You too.
Chandler Bing,Me too.
Chandler Bing,I'm not supposed to tell you.
Chandler Bing,You told us both we could be in the wedding?
Chandler Bing,"Rach, Rach, knock knock."
Chandler Bing,I'll tell you at the wedding.
Chandler Bing,"So technically, would this person be in the wedding?"
Chandler Bing,I'll do it!
Chandler Bing,I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Chandler Bing,I'll do it.
Chandler Bing,Na ha ha... Ne he he... Ah ah...
Chandler Bing,Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah!
Chandler Bing,Ready?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Chandler Bing,You look beautiful.
Chandler Bing,That really was an incredible wedding.
Chandler Bing,"I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had."
Chandler Bing,I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Chandler Bing,"So, where's Mike?"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Why are you wearing my apron?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""? No? Divorce?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!"
Chandler Bing,I'm so sorry...
Chandler Bing,"Monica. Calm, self."
Chandler Bing,Why would you say that?
Chandler Bing,Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
Chandler Bing,New York is awesome!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?"
Chandler Bing,That's great.
Chandler Bing,"So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?"
Chandler Bing,I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Chandler Bing,Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Chandler Bing,"Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer."
Chandler Bing,I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
Chandler Bing,"I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
Chandler Bing,"Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
Chandler Bing,Hey! How was lunch?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, really?"
Chandler Bing,"O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,How do you know?
Chandler Bing,Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Chandler Bing,Shovely Joe!
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
Chandler Bing,"You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it."
Chandler Bing,A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Chandler Bing,YOU NEVER DID IT!
Chandler Bing,"Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me."
Chandler Bing,Mrs Hannigan?
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city."
Chandler Bing,Damn it.
Chandler Bing,That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Chandler Bing,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
Chandler Bing,"You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think."
Chandler Bing,That is a bad interview.
Chandler Bing,Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Chandler Bing,To Ross!
Chandler Bing,"And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
Chandler Bing,"Man, those two dogs are going at it!"
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Really? What changed your mind?
Chandler Bing,"Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago."
Chandler Bing,Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Chandler Bing,You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Chandler Bing,No!
Chandler Bing,It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
Chandler Bing,Excuse me?
Chandler Bing,"For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents."
Chandler Bing,How did the job stuff go?
Chandler Bing,That's great!
Chandler Bing,How did the job stuff go?
Chandler Bing,Or facing a bitch of a commute.
Chandler Bing,My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
Chandler Bing,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but..."
Chandler Bing,I see.
Chandler Bing,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Chandler Bing,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright."
Chandler Bing,What do you think Pheebs?
Chandler Bing,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,You're kidding!
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah?
Chandler Bing,I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Chandler Bing,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
Chandler Bing,"It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?"
Chandler Bing,Sure.
Chandler Bing,And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Chandler Bing,"Don't, don't!"
Chandler Bing,Why!?
Chandler Bing,This can not be happening!
Chandler Bing,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers."
Chandler Bing,"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?"
Chandler Bing,"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out."
Chandler Bing,"Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too."
Chandler Bing,The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Chandler Bing,Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Chandler Bing,Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Chandler Bing,I never stopped loving you.
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein."
Chandler Bing,"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing."
Chandler Bing,Obviously.
Chandler Bing,Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Chandler Bing,I understand.
Chandler Bing,They're never coming down now.
Chandler Bing,Hey!
Chandler Bing,So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Chandler Bing,Where's your passport?
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's not."
Chandler Bing,At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.
Chandler Bing,We're taking a break!
Chandler Bing,Jumping on the bed?
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs."
Chandler Bing,What the hell is this?
Chandler Bing,I didn't know Monica had these!
Chandler Bing,Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,"I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!"
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Joe?"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!"
Chandler Bing,Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Chandler Bing,Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Chandler Bing,. Well played.
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Rach?"
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you."
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room."
Chandler Bing,"Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
Chandler Bing,Pheebs!
Chandler Bing,I think these are yours.
Chandler Bing,Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Chandler Bing,"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving."
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance."
Chandler Bing,"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years."
Chandler Bing,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Chandler Bing,Mine was a humdinger.
Chandler Bing,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
Chandler Bing,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Chandler Bing,You couldn't be cool.
Chandler Bing,"Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used."
Chandler Bing,Monica's grandmother.
Chandler Bing,Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Honey, it's gonna be okay."
Chandler Bing,What?
Chandler Bing,Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!
Chandler Bing,"Next time, can I say breathe?"
Chandler Bing,Where are you going?
Chandler Bing,You can't leave me alone with her.
Chandler Bing,This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Chandler Bing,"It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,"So, ah... Any plans for the summer?"
Chandler Bing,"Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?"
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both."
Chandler Bing,"One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this."
Chandler Bing,Is it really that bad?
Chandler Bing,I'm okay.
Chandler Bing,"Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle."
Chandler Bing,Wow!
Chandler Bing,It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's spongy."
Chandler Bing,I know. He has your eyes.
Chandler Bing,"I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does."
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,How do you feel?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!"
Chandler Bing,"Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good."
Chandler Bing,Interesting! Can I see you for a second?
Chandler Bing,What do we do?
Chandler Bing,Twins! Twins!!
Chandler Bing,"Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
Chandler Bing,"Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody."
Chandler Bing,What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Chandler Bing,"Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!"
Chandler Bing,Okay. Shhh...
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Okay!
Chandler Bing,She? It's a girl?
Chandler Bing,"Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough!"
Chandler Bing,"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet."
Chandler Bing,Bye!
Chandler Bing,Have fun at church-camp!
Chandler Bing,I know! You ready to trade?
Chandler Bing,Okay.
Chandler Bing,We could trade later.
Chandler Bing,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Her name is Erica.
Chandler Bing,Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Chandler Bing,I love you.
Chandler Bing,"I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!"
Chandler Bing,"We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."
Chandler Bing,Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
Chandler Bing,Alright.
Chandler Bing,"It's okay, it's just an egg roll."
Chandler Bing,"Okay, let's find these birds."
Chandler Bing,"Well, that can't be good!"
Chandler Bing,How?
Chandler Bing,"Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman."
Chandler Bing,"Joey, wait! The ball!"
Chandler Bing,I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Chandler Bing,No... It's all glued together.
Chandler Bing,I don't know. Maybe.
Chandler Bing,I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Chandler Bing,Did that movie ever get made?
Chandler Bing,"And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids."
Chandler Bing,What's the matter?
Chandler Bing,I understand.
Chandler Bing,"I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game."
Chandler Bing,"Well, I can't do it either."
Chandler Bing,"We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!"
Chandler Bing,That was... Impressive.
Chandler Bing,"Sorry about the table, man."
Chandler Bing,You gonna buy a new one?
Chandler Bing,"Well, at least we got these little guys out."
Chandler Bing,"Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?"
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you."
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room."
Chandler Bing,"You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry."
Chandler Bing,"I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?"
Chandler Bing,"Wow, this is weird."
Chandler Bing,Where's Ross?
Chandler Bing,"Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!"
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay."
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
Chandler Bing,Sure. Where?
