speaker,transcript
Joe Biden,"[Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Thank you for doin' it. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] I think --  [Broadcast on ABC] There was no consensus. If you go back and look at the intelligence reports, they said that it's more likely to be sometime by the end of the year.  [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] The idea that the tal -- and then it goes further on, even as late as August. I think you're gonna see -- the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others speaking about this later today. [Broadcast on ABC] Yeah. Well, the question was whether or not it w -- the idea that the Taliban would take over was premised on the notion that the -- that somehow, the 300,000 troops we had trained and equipped was gonna just collapse, they were gonna give up. I don't think anybody anticipated that -- [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] What -- what did he say was predicted? [Broadcast on ABC] Well, by the end of the year, I said that's that was -- that was a real possibility. But no one said it was gonna take over then when it was bein' asked. [Broadcast on ABC] Look, I don't think it was a fa -- look, it was a simple choice, George. When the -- when the Taliban -- let me back -- put it another way. When you had the government of Afghanistan, the leader of that government get in a plane and taking off and going to another country, when you saw the significant collapse of the -- Afghan troops we had trained -- up to 300,000 of them just leaving their equipment and taking off, that was -- you know, I'm not -- this -- that -- that's what happened. [Broadcast on ABC] That's simply what happened. So the question was in the beginning the -- the threshold question was, do we commit to leave within the timeframe we've set? We extended it to September 1st. Or do we put significantly more troops in? I hear people say, ""Well, you had 2,500 folks in there and nothin' was happening. You know, there wasn't any war.""  [Broadcast on ABC] But guess what? The fact was that the reason it wasn't happening is the last president negotiated a year earlier that he'd be out by May 1st and that -- in return, there'd be no attack on American forces. That's what was done. That's why nothing was happening. But the idea if I had said -- I had a simple choice. [Broadcast on ABC] If I had said, ""We're gonna stay,"" then we'd better prepare to put a whole hell of a lot more troops in -- [Broadcast on ABC] No, they didn't. It was split. Tha -- that wasn't true. That wasn't true. [Broadcast on ABC] No. Not at -- not in terms of whether we were going to get out in a timeframe all troops. They didn't argue against that. [Broadcast on ABC] No. No one said that to me that I can recall. Look, George, the reason why it's been stable for a year is because the last president said, ""We're leaving. And here's the deal I wanna make with you, Taliban. We're agreeing to leave if you agree not to attack us between now and the time we leave on May the 1st."" [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] I got into office, George --  [Broadcast on ABC] Less than two months after I elected to office, I was sworn in, all of a sudden, I have a May 1 deadline. I have a May 1 deadline. I got one of two choices. Do I say we're staying? And do you think we would not have to put a hell of a lot more troops? B -- you know, we had hundreds -- we had tens of thousands of troops there before. [Broadcast on ABC] Tens of thousands. Do you think we woulda -- that we would've just said, ""No problem. Don't worry about it, we're not gonna attack anybody. We're okay""? In the meantime, the Taliban was takin' territory all throughout the country in the north and down in the south, in the Pasthtun area. [Broadcast on ABC] I would've tried to figure out how to withdraw those troops, yes, because look, George. There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I gonna send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan -- in Afghanistan in perpetuity? [Broadcast on ABC] No one can name for me a time when this would end. And what -- wha -- wha -- what -- what constitutes defeat of the Taliban? What constitutes defeat? Would we have left then? Let's say they surrender like before. OK. Do we leave then? Do you think anybody -- the same people who think we should stay would've said, ""No, good time to go""? We spent over $1 trillion, George, 20 years. There was no good time to leave. [Broadcast on ABC] Number one, as you know, the intelligence community did not say back in June or July that, in fact, this was gonna collapse like it did. Number one. [Broadcast on ABC] But not this quickly. Not even close. We had already issued several thousand, um, passports to the -- the SIVs, the people -- the -- the -- the translators when I came into office before we had negotiated getting out at the end of s -- August. Secondly, we're in a position where what we did was took precautions. [Broadcast on ABC] That's why I authorized that there be 6,000 American troops to flow in to accommodate this exit, number one. And number two, provided all that aircraft in the Gulf to get people out. We pre-positioned all that, anticipated that. Now, granted, it took two days to take control of the airport. We have control of the airport now. [Broadcast on ABC] Oh, there is. But, look, b -- but no one's being killed right now, God forgive me if I'm wrong about that, but no one's being killed right now. People are -- we got 1,000-somewhat, 1,200 out, yesterday, a couple thousand today. And it's increasing. We're gonna get those people out. [Broadcast on ABC] That was four days ago, five days ago. [Broadcast on ABC] What I thought was we ha -- we have to gain control of this. We have to move this more quickly. We have to move in a way in which we can take control of that airport. And we did. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Look, that's like askin' my deceased son Beau, who spent six months in Kosovo and a year in Iraq as a Navy captain and then major -- I mean, as an Army major. And, you know, I'm sure h -- he had regrets comin' out of Afganista -- I mean, out of Iraq. He had regrets to what's -- how -- how it's going. But the idea -- what's the alternative? [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] The alternative is why are we staying in Afghanistan? Why are we there? Don't you think that the one -- you know who's most disappointed in us getting out? Russia and China. They'd love us to continue to have to -- [Broadcast on ABC] No. I -- I --  I don't think it could've been handled in a way that there -- we -- we're gonna go back in hindsight and look, but the idea that somehow there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens. I don't know how that happened. [Broadcast on ABC] Yes. Now, exactly what happened -- is not priced in. But I knew that they're gonna have an enormous, enorm -- look, one of the things we didn't know is what the Taliban would do in terms of trying to keep people from getting out, what they would do.  [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] What are they doing now? They're cooperating, letting American citizens get out, American personnel get out, embassies get out, et cetera. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] But they're having -- we're having some more difficulty in having those who helped us when we were in there -- [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Pardon me? [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Well -- we do know generically and in some specificity what's happening outside of Kabul. We don't know it in great detail. But we do know. And guess what? The Taliban knows if they take on American citizens or American military, we will strike them back like hell won't have it. [Broadcast on ABC] We're gonna do everything in our power to get all Americans out and our allies out. [Broadcast on ABC] It depends on where we are and whether we can get -- ramp these numbers up to 5,000 to 7,000 a day coming out. If that's the case, we'll be -- they'll all be out. [Broadcast on ABC] Yes. [Broadcast on ABC] Yes. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Well, that's not the s -- [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] That's too high. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] The estimate we're giving is somewhere between 50,000 and 65,000 folks total, counting their families. [Broadcast on ABC] The commitment holds to get everyone out that, in fact, we can get out and everyone that should come out. And that's the objective. That's what we're doing now, that's the path we're on. And I think we'll get there. [Broadcast on ABC] No. Americans should understand that we're gonna try to get it done before August 31st. [Broadcast on ABC] If -- if we don't, we'll determine at the time who's left. [Broadcast on ABC] And if you're American force -- if there's American citizens left, we're gonna stay to get them all out. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Sh -- why wouldn't China say that? Look, George, the idea that w -- there's a fundamental difference between -- between Taiwan, South Korea, NATO. We are in a situation where they are in -- entities we've made agreements with based on not a civil war they're having on that island or in South Korea, but on an agreement where they have a unity government that, in fact, is trying to keep bad guys from doin' bad things to them. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] We have made -- kept every commitment. We made a sacred commitment to Article Five that if in fact anyone were to invade or take action against our NATO allies, we would respond. Same with Japan, same with South Korea, same with -- Taiwan. It's not even comparable to talk about that. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] It's not comparable to t -- [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Who -- who's gonna say that? Look, before I made this decision, I met with all our allies, our NATO allies in Europe. They agreed. We should be getting out. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Sure, they had a choice. Look, the one thing I promise you in private, NATO allies are not quiet. You remember from your old days. They're not gonna be quiet. And so -- and by the way, you know, what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be putting together a group of the G-7, the folks that we work with the most -- to -- I was on the phone with -- with Angela Merkel today. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] I was on the phone with the British prime minister. I'm gonna be talking to Macron in France to make sure we have a coherent view of how we're gonna deal from this point on. [Broadcast on ABC] No. I think -- let me put it this way. I think they're going through sort of an existential crisis about do they want to be recognized by the international community as being a legitimate government. I'm not sure they do. But look, they have -- [Broadcast on ABC] Well, they do. But they also care about whether they have food to eat, whether they have an income that -- [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] -- they can provide for their f -- that they -- [Broadcast on ABC] can make any money and run an economy. They care about whether or not they can hold together the society that they in fact say they care so much about. I'm not counting on any of that. [Broadcast on ABC] But that is part of what I think is going on right now in terms of I -- I'm not sure I would've predicted, George, nor would you or anyone else, that when we decided to leave, that they'd provide safe passage for Americans to get out. [Broadcast on ABC] As many as we can get out, we should. For example, I had a meeting today for a couple hours in the Situation Room just below here. There are Afghan women outside the gate. I told 'em, ""Get 'em on the planes. Get them out. Get them out. Get their families out if you can."" But here's the deal, George. The idea that we're able to deal with the rights of women around the world by military force is not rational. [Broadcast on ABC] Not rational. Look what's happened to the Uyghurs in western China. Look what's happening in other parts of the world. Look what's happenin' in,  [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] -- you know, in --  [Broadcast on ABC] -- in the Congo. I mean, there are a lotta places where women are being subjugated. The way to deal with that is not with a military invasion. The way to deal with that is putting economic, diplomatic, and national pre -- international pressure on them to change their behavior. [Broadcast on ABC] It could be. But George, look, here's the deal. Al-Qaeda, ISIS, they metastasize. There's a significantly greater threat to the United States from Syria. There's a significantly greater threat from East Africa. There's significant greater threat to other places in the world than it is from the mountains of Afghanistan. [Broadcast on ABC] And we have maintained the ability to have an over-the-horizon capability to take them out. We're -- we don't have military in Syria to make sure that we're gonna be protected -- [Broadcast on ABC] Yeah. I'm confident we're gonna have the over-the-horizon capability, yes.  [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Look, George, it's like asking me, you know, am I confident that people are gonna act even remotely rationally. Here's the deal.  [Broadcast on ABC] The deal is the threat from Al-Qaeda and their associate organizations is greater in other parts of the world to the United States than it is from Afghanistan. [Broadcast on ABC] No. That tells me that -- [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] -- my dad used to have an expression, George. If everything's equally important to you, nothing's important to you.  [Broadcast on ABC] We should be focusing on where the threat is the greatest. And the threat -- the idea -- we can continue to spend $1 trillion and have tens of thousands of American forces in Afghanistan when we have what's going on around the world, in the Middle East and North Africa and west -- I mean, excuse me -- yeah, North Africa and Western Africa. [Broadcast on ABC] The idea we can do that and ignore those -- those looming problems, growing problems, is not -- not rational. [Broadcast on ABC] Not true. It's not true. They're not gonna look just like they were we were attacked. There was a guy named Osama bin Laden that was still alive and well. They were organized in a big way, that they had significant help  [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] from arou --  [Broadcast on ABC] -- from other parts of the world. We went there for two reasons, George. Two reasons. [Broadcast on ABC] One, to get Bin Laden, and two, to wipe out as best we could, and we did, the Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. We did it. Then what happened? Began to morph into the notion that, instead of having a counterterrorism capability to have small forces there in -- or in the region to be able to take on Al-Qaeda if it tried to reconstitute, we decided to engage in nation building. [Broadcast on ABC] In nation building. That never made any sense to me. [Broadcast on ABC] We should've. [Broadcast on ABC] Well, by the -- what would be messy? [Broadcast on ABC] If we had gotten out a long time ago -- getting out would be messy no matter when it occurred.  [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] I ask you, you want me to stay, you want us to stay and send your kids back to Afghanistan? How about it? Are you g -- if you had a son or daughter, would you send them in Afghanistan now? Or later? [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] They've done it because, in fact, there was a circumstance that was different when we started. We were there for two reasons, George. And we accomplished both ten years ago. We got Osama bin Laden. As I said and got criticized for saying at the time, we're gonna follow him to the gates of hell. Hell, we did -- [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] One that we overextended what we needed to do to deal with our national interest. That's like my sayin' they -- they're -- they -- they b -- b -- the border of Tajikistan -- and -- other -- what -- does it matter? Are we gonna go to war because of what's goin' on in Tajikistan? What do you think? Tell me what -- where in that isolated country that has never, never, never in all of history been united, all the way back to Alexander the Great, straight through the British Empire and the Russians, what is the idea? [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Are we gonna s -- continue to lose thousands of Americans to injury and death to try to unite that country? What do you think? I think not. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] I think the American people are with me. And when you unite that country, what do you have? They're surrounded by Russia in the north or the Stans in the north. You have -- to the west, they have Iran. To the south, they have Pakistan, who's supporting them. And to the -- and -- actually, the east, they have Pakistan and China. Tell me. Tell me. Is that worth our national interest to continue to spend another $1 trillion and lose thousands more American lives? For what? [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] We're gonna get the booster shots. And -- it's somethin' that I think -- you know, because we g -- w -- we got our shots all the way back in I think December. So it's -- it's -- it's past time. And so the idea [Noise in background] that the recommendation -- that's my wife calling. [Laughs] No. [Laughs] But all kiddin' aside, yes, we will get the booster shots. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Absolutely because we're providing more to the rest of the world than all the rest of the world combined. We got enough for everybody American, plus before this year is -- before we get to the middle of next year, we're gonna provide a half a billion shots to the rest of the world. We're keepin' our part of the bargain. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] We're doin' more than anybody. [Edited Out / Removed on Broadcast] Thank you."
Joe Biden,"Happy to. Well, I don't think he will. But I think it's irresponsible of him to talk about it, the idea that a world leader of one of the largest nuclear powers in the world says he may use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome. And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war, or anything. But it just -- once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the, miscalculations? Who knows what would happen? There's been discussions on that. But I'm not going to get into that. It'd be irresponsible of me, just to talk about what we would or wouldn't do. The Pentagon didn't have to be asked. I think he is a rational actor who's miscalculated significantly. I think he thought -- you may recall, I pointed out that they were going to invade that all those 100,000 or more troops there? And no one believed that he was going to invade Ukraine. You listen to what he says. If you listen to the speech, he made, after when that decision was being made? He talked about the whole idea of he was needed to be a leader of Russia that united all of a Russian speaker -- I mean, it just -- I just think it's irrational. No, I didn't say he's not rational. I think -- I think the speech is. His objectives were not. I think he thought, Jake, I think he thought he's going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was, this has been the home of Mother Russia, and Kyiv, and they were -- he was going to be welcomed. And I think he just totally miscalculated. I don't know what's in his mind. But clearly, he could leave. He could just flat leave, and still probably hold his position together in Russia, the idea that he's been able to convince the significant Russian -- of the Russian people that this is something that he thought made sense, but now he's accomplished what he wanted to do, and it's time to bring Russians home. Look, I have no intention of meeting with him. But, for example, if he came to me, at the G20, and said, ""I want to talk about the release of Griner,"" I'd meet with him. I mean, it would depend. But I can't imagine -- look, we've taken a position. I just did a G7 meeting this morning. The idea, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. So, I'm not about to, nor is anyone else prepared to negotiate with Russia, about them, staying in Ukraine, keeping any part of Ukraine et cetera. So, it would depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about. But look, he's acted brutally. He's acted brutally. He, I think, he's committed war crimes. And so, I don't -- I don't see any rationale, to meet with him now. Yes. Well, no, I don't think so at all. I think, look, it was directed -- when I'm talking about, I'm talking to Putin. He in fact, cannot continue with impunity, to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, as if that's a rational thing to do. The mistakes get made. And given them -- and the miscalculation could occur. No one can be sure what would happen, and it could end in Armageddon. Well, no, I don't think anyone, any rational person is saying the initial use of tactical -- of a nuclear weapon, killing thousands of people, does not have the prospect of leading to something that can be way out of control. Yes. And, by the way, let's get straight why I went. I didn't go to one -- about oil. I went about making sure that we made sure that we weren't going to walk away, from the Middle East, and what was going on. And, by the way, today, I just got off the telephone, with the President of -- I got off the phone, with the Prime Minister of Israel, and the President of Lebanon. They've worked out a deal. They've been at war -- declared war, with one another, for a long time. They've worked out a boundary relationship, along the -- in the Eastern Mediterranean, for oil. And they're going to make an agreement that is historic. We also got overflights, for Israeli planes, over Saudi Arabia. We got movement, in terms of how we would deal in the Middle East, with aggression from Iran. But it wasn't in other -- eight other -- there are eight other parties there. It wasn't about -- it wasn't about oil. But we should, we should, and I am, in the process, when the -- this House and Senate gets back, they're going to have to -- there's going to be some consequences, for what they've done, with Russia. I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I'm having in mind. But there will be -- there will be consequences. No. Look, they've been saying this now how -- every six months, they say this. Every six months, they look down the next six months, and say what's going to happen. It hadn't happened yet. It hadn't been -- there has -- there is no -- there's no guarantee that there's going to recession. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession. That is, we'll move down slightly. Well, look, think about what's happened. We have done more. We're in a better position than any other major country in the world, economically and politically. We are -- we still have real problems. But look what we got done. We passed so much legislation that significantly it makes a -- makes the point about, for example, the American Rescue Plan, the legislation to deal with inflation, the Inflation Act, we moved along. I mean, there's so much has been accomplished, that the idea that there's something -- there's an automaticity to recession is just not -- is just not there. They keep -- they've been predicting this off and on, for the last -- It is possible. Look, it is possible. I don't anticipate it. But I do think -- look, we talk about the impact on families. The families are, they have reason to be concerned, about energy prices. They have reason to be concerned about a whole range of issues. But look, what we've done. We've been able to -- the Inflation Reduction Act. There's -- look, I know I always quoted my dad. But my dad used to say, ""What -- is there any breathing room, for a middle- class family?"" And the breathing room is after all the bills are paid, at the end of the month, they have anything left. And there's more than one way to bring down the cost, monthly cost, for people, who in fact are struggling, that to make sure they have -- the ends meet, and they have enough money. And that's what we've done with Inflation Reduction Act. Look, we've reduced drug prices. We've allowed, for the first time, we've been trying for years, to get Medicare to be able to negotiate drug prices. We pay the highest drug price of any nation in the world, any major nation. We are going to be in a situation, where no senior is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year, for the drugs, no matter how much they cost. We've reduced the price -- we are going to make sure that nobody has to pay more than $35 a month for insulin, et cetera. So, there's so much that we've done. And the same with, on energy. We passed the -- look, what I ran on, I said we're going to deal with energy. And the energy problem, we're going to deal with the whole notion of global warming. We passed $368 billion worth of help, which, as the same banker is talking about, is going to bring a $1.7 trillion -- million dollar, billion dollars off the sidelines, in investment. Look what's happened -- look at the investment that's going on, in America, right now. More now -- Oh, I think we do. I know we do. And here's the contrast. We know it -- what's the Republican platform to run on? What are they running on? What are they for? Well, they want to put Social Security, on the chopping block. Every five years, and the other leader comes along, and says, ""No, every year, it should be up for grabs."" Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, these aren't negotiable items, in terms of whether you're going to have a continuum or not. They -- and they've -- the first thing they said they're going to do is get rid of the Inflation Reduction Act. And so, what's that doing? They're going to raise drug prices, raise medical costs, again, be sure that we're going to no longer be able to have the ability, to have tax credits, for weatherizing your homes, and money? I mean, I don't know what they're for. Well, first of all, I'm proud of my son. This is a kid, who got -- not a kid, he's a grown man. And he got hooked on, like many families have had happened, hooked on drugs. He's overcome that. He's established a new life. He is, I'm confident that he is -- what he says, and does, are consistent with what happens. And, for example, he wrote a book about his problems, and was straightforward about it. I'm proud of him. He came along and said -- by the way, this thing about a gun? I didn't know anything about it. But turns out that when he made application, to purchase a gun, what happened was he said -- I guess, you get asked -- I don't guess. You get asked the question, ""Are you on drugs? You use drugs?"" He said, ""No."" And he wrote about saying ""No,"" in his book. So, I have great confidence in my son. I love him. And he's on the straight and narrow, and he has been, for a couple years now. And I'm just so proud of him. [Laughs] Well, they're concerned about whether or not I'd get anything done. Look what I've gotten done. Name me a president, in recent history, who's gotten as much done, as I have, in the first two years. Not a joke. You may not like what I got done. But the vast majority of the American people do like what I got done. And so, I just, it's a matter of, can you do the job. And I believe I can do the job. I've been able to do the job. I've gotten more done. I got the Inflation Reduction. I got all these pieces of legislation passed. And I ran on that. I said, this is what I was going to do. And I'm still getting it done. We've had, dealing with, making sure that veterans get compensated for the, for -- The burn pits. Making sure that we're in a situation, where we finally have action on guns. And, by the way, I'm going to get the assault weapons ban. Before this is over, I'm going to get that. Again, not a joke. And watch. And so, I just think there's a, you know, it's a matter of, has anybody done more, in the first two years of their administration, for a guy, who was -- they've been saying this about my age for -- since I began to run. And so, you know? Will you come work out with me in the morning? Well, look, I'm not going to make this about my decision. I'm going to make this off-year election. After that's done, in November, and then I'm going to be in the process of deciding. I believe I can beat Donald Trump again. Thank you. That's a fact! If I weren't, I'd be sleeping alone. I married a Philly girl! Thank you."
Joe Biden,"I'm happy to. It was kind of like going home. I know that sounds strange, but it does I -- I was raised by what my Jewish friends call a righteous Christian who -- were we come home for dinner before I go back and close the business. And it's a place where we gathered to have conversation incidentally. And he used to talk about how -- how what happened to the Jews in Europe was so terrible and why did we bombed the railroad tracks and why didn't we go to the concentration camps etc. And so I've, I've, I've had a relationship with the Jewish community in my state. That has really been close from the time I was 20 years old. And -- and then gotten to meet every prime minister and as gold mayor. Gold had a great line I was with her. And she was actually warned she was sitting at her desk and a guy sitting next to me was her assistant a guy named Rabin. For real. And she was sitting at her desk and pulling down those maps she had me and talking about all the damage and everything that were done. And so it was all of a sudden she said, ""Would you like a picture?"" And I said, ""Well, yes, Madam Prime Minister, and she's looking straight ahead. She said, ""Don't look so sad."" I said, ""Madam Prime Minister, the picture you painted."" we're just looking straight ahead. She said, ""We have a secret weapon."" I thought she was gonna tell me. So I turned. She said, ""We have no place to go."" That's true. And that's why I think it's so important that we maintain the kind of relationship we have. Because the only worse than the Iran that exists now is Iran with nuclear weapons. And if we can return to the deal and hold on tight, I think it was a gigantic mistake for the last president to get out of the deal. They're closer to a nuclear weapon now than there were before. It doesn't have anything to do with whether or not the cause for us is going to stop or they're going to continue to be engaged in activities. We can act against that and still have a deal where they can tell their nuclear program. And so I still think it makes sense we've laid out on the table. We've made the deal. We've offered it and it's up to Iran now. Yes. That was a last resort? Yes. I'm not going to speculate on that, but Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon. I'm not going to discuss that. No, I can't. The trip is about stability in the Middle East. It's overwhelming the interest in United States of America to have more stability in the Middle East, number one. It's overwhelming the interest of Israel and I think the United States in the region for Israel a more integrated region and accepted as an equal. And so for every reason it makes sense to me that I would go to the GCC is not just Saudis happens to be held in Saudi Arabia now, but it's all about making sure that we're in a situation where the broader picture is that there are those who thought with the last administration, we sort of walked away from the Middle East that we were going to create a vacuum that China and or Russia would fill, and we can't let that happen. And so -- and secondly, more Israel is integrated in another region as [inaudible] accepted, the more likely there is going to be a means by which they can eventually come to accommodation with the Palestinians down the road. Oh, it's going to take a long time but increasing a relationship in terms of acceptance of issues of each other's presence, the working together on certain things, it all make sense to me. There are a few of them. I think they're wrong. I think they're making a mistake. Israel is a democracy. Israel is our ally. Israel is a friend. And I think that I make no apologies. We've -- we've provided for my administration for billion dollars plus the billion for Iron Dome, and we're working on a laser project to be able to replace Iron Dome. It's overwhelming our interest that is that Israel be stable. No, no, there's no possibility I think of the Democratic Party or even a significant portion Republican Party walking away from Israel. Now what you're going to see is Israel's a democracy. We're committed to the state, not an individual leader, just like Israel. Our allies are not committed to an individual president. They're committed to the state of the United States. And so Bibi and I have known each other for close to 40 years. And we, we know where we agree where we disagree, we make no bones about it, but it's -- I'm dealing with a democratic state that is going through a decision as to who they're going to have as leader. Whoever the leader is, I'll work with. Well, look, you may recall that I think personal diplomacy matters. What the -- the war that took place not too long ago, lasted days, not months, because I got deeply involved in talking with all the leadership, whether it was -- whether it was in Israel or whether it was with -- with a boss or whether it was Egyptians. And so I think that it always matters to talk to see if you can reach any consensus even on small things, to lessen the prospects of continued conflict. Well, look. As you accurately pointed out when we predicted -- I predicted he was going to attack others were saying no, he's not going to -- he's going to -- he's going to invade. The idea that we would stand by in the West NATO in particular, and have the largest invasion of physical force and other countries since World War II and stand there was just not even not in the cards, and everything that he's attempted to accomplish has backfired for him. Number two, we were able to maintain complete coherence and stability in Europe at all the NATO allies. And -- and as I said at the time, when we impose sanctions -- the sanctions on Russia was gonna hurt everybody. We were going to but it was the price of being able to keep this guy from being able to succeed, and I think it's important. As long as it's going to take. When we're there tool takes whatever time it takes. We cannot let him prevail. It could. No, you said that. You said it could. OK. No. It could. But I think that the pressure on Putin, in particular, on Russia generally, is meant they're not just trying to defeat Ukraine and trying to eliminate Ukraine and said we just can't let that stand. Nobody says that. I don't ever remember saying that. They're at all my biographies, they say Biden knew he wanted to be president. No. That's not true. What I did, let me tell you, I got involved in public life, because of the civil rights movement. It wasn't about being president when anybody run for office. For example, everybody says I knew I was going to be a senator before I was 30. Know what happened? I was trying to organize the Democratic Party as part of a young guy trying to get involved with some senior members to move it into the -- into the Democratic Party of the Northeast. And so I got involved in a group of people came to me and said, ""You got to run for local office."" I said I was 26 years old. I said, ""I can't, I'm just starting a law firm."" And I said, well, the Senate you can go to Dover I said I can't do that. And then the group came in local group from where I lived came to me and said, ""How about running for the county council?"" And I looked at him I said, ""I don't have time."" but I was gonna be a good soldier and get in there. I won a four-year term. Next thing I know, I'm trying to get someone to run for the Senate with a group of people and a group came to me and said, ""Why don't you run?"" I said to them, ""Am I old enough to run?"" One thing led to another and here I am. I'm not predicted but I -- I would, I would not be disappointed. No. Look. The one thing I know about politics in American politics, in particular, is there's no way to predict what's gonna happen. I -- where I'm not even halfway through my term yet, because there's a lot of room to figure out what's going to happen. But my hope is, my hope is that the Republican Party moves back to a normal -- normal position is not this mega party that is become in many ways, and conclude by saying that I ran for three reasons. This last time I had no intention of running for real until I saw those people coming out of the fields down in Virginia, in Charlottesville carrying torches and Nazi flags and singing the same anti-semitic bile that was sung in the 30s in Germany, and my family we sat had a family meeting, they thought I should run and I took a shot. So I've run it for three reasons and no one in my campaign agreed. I said number one, to restore the soul of America, to get back to who we are as a people. And the way we tend to the way we talk to one another, the way we treat one another. The second thing was to rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class when the middle class does well, everybody does well we'll pour them away up and the wealthy stay wealthy. And thirdly, to unite the country. I still haven't accomplished that third piece, and that's what I'm trying to do. No, that was my original campaign. So we'll see. Thank you. Well, if you need a ride home, we're going. All right. Well, thank you so much. Here's the deal, ready? We're all going to sing Happy Birthday. Ready? One, two, three. [With group] Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Yonit, happy birthday to you. Like I said, it's hell turning 30. Thank you, thank you. Alright. "
Joe Biden,"How you doing, pal? Good to see you. Good to see you. Well. [Applause] Thank you. [Laughter] It's good to be back. No. I'm going to go out in the audience. [Laughs] Sure. Sure is. Well, the virus -- look, here's the -- it's real simple: We have a pandemic for those who haven't gotten a vaccination. It's that basic, that simple. Ten thousand people have recently died; 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn't been vaccinated. There's a simple, basic proposition: If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in an ICU unit, and you're not going to die. So it's gigantically important that you act like -- we all act like Americans that care about our -- our fellow Americans. To get -- there's legitimate questions people can ask -- that they worry about getting vaccinated -- but the questions should be asked, answered, and people should get vaccinated. But this is not a pandemic. We've made sure that since I got in office, we -- we've inoculated over 160 million people; 85 percent of people over the age of 50. [Applause] Anyway. It's frustrating. Well, I'm saying -- look -- [laughs] -- it's a little bit like when I got elected. You know, the -- this pandemic was out of control. You know, we've lost more people in the United States -- over 630-some-thousand people than in every major war we've ever fought, in the United States of America. And that's come to a screeching halt for those who've been vaccinated. It really has. Not a joke. This is overwhelming evidence to sustain that. And so, what I say to people who are worried about a new pandemic is: Get vaccinated. If you're vaccinated, even if you do catch the ""virus,"" quote, unquote -- like people talk about it in normal terms -- you're in overwhelm- -- not many people do. If you do, you're not likely to get sick. You're probably going to be symptomless. You're not going to be in a position where you -- where your life is in danger. So, it's really, kind of, basic. Okay. God love you. The most important, thankless job in the world: being on a school board. I understand your concern. I really do. My children are grown now, but my grandchildren -- and I have one who's only one-and-a-half years old. So, you know, I understand -- number one. My message is that one of the reasons why -- you remember the criticism I got initially, saying, ""Teachers should get vaccination, get in line first."" The vast majority of teachers are vaccinated, number one. Number two, the CDC is going to say that what we should do is, everyone over the age of -- under the age of 12 should probably be wearing a mask in school. That's probably what's going to happen. Secondly, those over the age of 12 who are able to get vaccinated -- if you're vaccinated, you shouldn't wear a mask. If you aren't vaccinated, you should be wearing a mask. So it's going to get a little bit tight in terms of, ""Well, are mom or dad being honest that, you know, Johnny did or did not get vaccinated?"" That's going to raise questions. But I think what's going to happen is you're going to see this work out in ways that people are going to know in the community. Everybody knows in the community whether or not Johnny really did get the vaccination when he's 15 or 17 years old. And so it's going to -- I think it's -- it's a matter of community responsibility, and I think you're going to see it work through. Soon, I believe. Now, look, one of the things that I committed to do when I got elected -- I said -- Well, I -- and let me he- -- let me finish the question -- the answer. ""Soon"" in the sense that I do not tell any scientists what they should do. I do not interfere. [Applause] And so they are doing -- they are doing the examinations now -- the testing now, and making the decision now. When they are ready, when they've done all the scientific need to be done to determine children at ages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, they, in fact, are -- all have different makeups. They're developing. They're trying to figure out whether or not there's a vaccination that would affect one child that's at such and such an age and not another child. That's underway. Just like the other question, there's a logical -- and I've heard you speak about it because you always -- I'm not being solicitous, but you -- you're always straight up about what you're doing. And the question is whether or not we should be in a position where you are -- why can't the -- the -- the experts say, ""We know that this virus is, in fact -- it's going to be... "" -- or, excuse me -- ""We know why all the drugs approved are not temporarily approved, but permanently approved."" That's underway too. I expect that to occur quickly. For the FDA. The Federal Drug Administration. What they're telling me is, ""Let us decide, based on scientific data, in how we proceed. Do it the way we would ordinarily do it."" Look, for example, everybody talks about how, you know, this virus came -- this -- this -- the drugs that are designed to kill the virus came along so quickly. They've been working on it for two decades. There's nothing quick about this. It's been over two decades. So people said, ""I'm not taking a drug that was approved so quickly."" It's been two decades. The truth is we haven't said it enough to people to allay their feals [sic]. There's nothing -- their fears. This is nothing that just happened yesterday and they said, ""Well, let's take a shot on this."" And there's a process. Usually the process takes the better part of a year or more to get some of these things decided. But the expectation -- they're not promising me any specific date -- but my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together -- over 20 of them, plus others in the field -- is that sometime maybe in the beginning of the school year -- at the end of August, beginning of September, October -- they'll get a final approval saying the FDA said, ""No, this is it. It's good."" But again, one last thing. I -- we don't talk enough to you about this, I don't think. One last thing that's really important is: We're not in a position where we think that any virus -- including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non -- unvaccinated people -- the vi- -- the various shots that people are getting now cover that. They're -- you're okay. You're not going to -- you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations. Doc, how are you? What we're doing is, number one, to restore America's faith in science is listen to the scientists. [Applause begins] No, I'm not joking. [Applause] I mean, literally listen to the scientists, and not interfere, not rush anything. Just make -- let the scientists proceed, because they desperately want to get this right -- number one. Number two, you may have heard -- I never get myself in trouble, as you know, politically -- [laughs] -- but you may have heard that I was critical of some of the things that are on Facebook, and it was that I was attacking Facebook. I wasn't attacking Facebook. There was a report out saying that for that -- something like 45 percent of the overwhelming disinformation on Facebook comes from 12 individuals. I said: They're killing people -- those 12 individuals; that misinformation is going to kill people. Not a joke. Not a joke. It's like telling your kid, ""I tell you what... "" -- four years old -- ""... when you see a red light, cross the street."" I mean, come on. And so, what we're trying to do is use every avenue we can -- public, private, government, non-government -- to try to get the facts out, what they really are. And one of the things, Doc, that's happening, that I'm feeling better about -- I'm not being a wise guy now. You know, you -- one of those other networks is not a big fan of mine. [Laughter] One you talk about a lot. But if you noticed, as they say in that southern part of my state, ""They've had an altar call,"" some of those guys. [Laughter] All of a sudden, they're out there saying, ""Let's get vaccinated. Let's get vaccinated."" The very people who before this were saying -- So that -- but that -- I shouldn't make fun. That's good. It's good. It's good. We just have to keep telling the truth. That's why -- for example, my wife just flew to Alaska today to do an event in Alaska about making sure people understand and get vaccinated, talking about COVID, et cetera. So it's -- you know. And, by the way, there's pockets. If you notice, there's about -- what? -- four or five states that have close to 45 percent or whatever. Don't hold me to the exact number. No, but I mean, out of all the cases -- -- all the cases, a very overwhelming majority of those cases are in four or five states. And it's just not -- there's nothing political about this. There's no blue or red. [Applause] I'd brag if I were you too. [Applause] As they say when they look at me and my wife: ""You married up, kid."" [Laughter] It's really an important question because, in the African American community, there is less of an uptake of the vaccination. Number one, there's a reason for that: You know, you go back just to even World War Two. African Americans were used as experimental; they were almost like guinea pigs in terms of ex- -- they were -- anyway. And your mom and dad remember that, or your grandparents remember that. And so there's a reason for people to think that, ""I don't know, I'm not sure I trust. I'm not sure I trust this."" Plus, a lot of disinformation on top of it. One of the things that we're doing is what I've done -- ""we've"" done, excuse me -- my team has done -- is we've provided the ability to put in African American communities the vaccine and those who are, in fact, able to administer the vaccine, and people who are respected in the community, in the vacc- -- in those areas, particularly in areas where you have public health commu- -- public health centers, where you, in fact, have people who are the folks who are really at the low end of the economic scale, don't have much access to anything. So we've taken literally mobile vans and people to the communities, to the hardest-hit communities, and it's beginning to have some impact. But we have to talk about it more. For example, I was just with -- I get in trouble because my wife is a Philly girl and a Philly fan, an Eagles fan. I just hosted the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And -- and there's a guy -- there's a quarterback there. What's his name, man? [Laughter] Anyway, all kidding aside, you know, what we're doing is getting people of consequence, who are respected in the community -- whether they're athletes, whether or not they are entertainers, whether they're just well respected. And, by the way, one of the things I've gotten able to get done: I've get -- I have overwhelming support from the African American clergy that I sort of come from, and my so- -- support. They are opening up their churches for -- as vaccination centers. [Applause] Well, it is ""we."" Well, I think -- you're going to -- this is going to seem like a non-answer to start with. One of the things I said when I ran for office -- it's not Democrat or Republican again -- is we got to restore faith in government. You got to get people to a point where they trust government. And I made a commitment that when I made a mistake, I'd tell you I've made mistakes. And when I think I got it right, I'll say it. But I'll take responsibility for what I do and say. Part of it is just generally -- [Applause] -- no, I don't mean that -- part of it is, generally, raising confidence in elected officials. Raising confidence. And I know this is going to sound like a non-answer to you, but part of this is that, you know -- you know because you're one of the most informed journalists in the country. You know the criticism I got when I said I'm going to unite the country. They said, ""You can't unite the country."" Well, if we can't unite the country, we can never get some of these problems solved. And that goes to trust. Why can't you unite the country? Why isn't there a willingness to trust? Government trust is really at a -- was at an incredibly low ebb. It's coming up some. So with regard to your family in particular. Part of it is not just that they see you on television and trust you; the people who seem to have the most impact are the -- are, you know, that -- for that 17-year-old kid, the kid that he or she plays ball with. ""You got the vaccination? Are you okay? I mean, you seem... "" ""No, it works."" Or you, you know -- or the mom and dad, or the neighbor, or when you go to church, or when you're -- no, I really mean it. There are trusted interlocutors. Think of the people -- if your kid wanted to find out whether or not there were -- there's a man on the moon, or whatever -- you know, something, or, you know, whether those aliens are here or not -- you know, who are the people they talk to beyond the kids who love talking about it? They go to people they respect, and they say, ""What do you think?"" And so they should be asking other people -- the people there -- everything from their teachers to their ministers to the priest, to people that they trust. Isn't it amazing we're saying ""40 or younger""? [Laughter] It's hard to say, isn't it? Yes. Well, by the way, I think that is -- that's happening. And, look, think about this: This is the worst health crisis in 100 years. As I said, more people have died than all our major wars combined. Think about that. If I told you that or you had told me that two years ago, I'd say, ""Come on. That's not going to happen in America."" But it happened. It happened. And people are unfortunately -- some more slowly than others -- Now, by the way, remember when I first got elected, the issue was, well, I said I was going to do a million shots a week, and people said, ""Biden can't do that"" or ""Biden team can't do that."" And it was 2 million. We had trouble getting enough people -- and people who wanted to get vaccinated. We're opening up stadiums. We're getting 100,000 people coming through. So, the vast majority of the American people said, ""I understand. I want to get this vaccination."" But now, when the -- when it's phased off, either ""I'm invincible, I'm young, I'm not going to get sick, it won't happen to me"" -- or whatever the reason -- now they're looking around and they're saying, ""Whoa, boy. In the community I live in, there's very few people who have gotten the vaccination. This COVID is much more transmissible; it's really rising. I better get some... "" So, I think it's gradually changing. And you got a great dog there, kid. [Laughter] But your dog is a Democrat -- I can tell. [Laughter and applause] I'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm a big dog person. I'm sorry. First of all, the good news is the economy is picking up significantly. It's rational, when you think about it. The cost of an automobile bill, it's kind of back to what it was before the pandemic. We compare what the prices were for the last year in the pandemic, and they are up. They're up because, in fact, there was not much to call for. For example, automobiles: You know, you had the rental car companies selling off their entire stock. You found yourself in the same way with automobile dealers. And all of a sudden, now it's coming back, and we're going to grow at 7 percent -- is expected. We created more jobs in the first six months of my -- our administration than any time in American history. No President has ever -- no administration has ever created as many jobs. And all of a sudden, people are saying -- [Applause] -- no, I don't say it -- but it goes to the legitimate question being asked about the concern about inflation. The vast majority of the experts, including Wall Street, are suggesting that it's highly unlikely that it's going to be long-term inflation that's going to get out of hand. There will be near-term inflation because everything is now trying to be picked back up. And, by the way, that's one of the reasons why I also signed an executive order dealing with the whole idea of competition -- you know, the idea that we're in a situation where there are so many companies who are keeping people out of the competition. For example, you have over 600,000 people out there signing -- 6 million people signing a -- I better check the number -- of -- signing non-compete agreements. Not because they have any sta- -- any secret, but because they were working for one fast food restaurant, and they're told they can't get 10 cents more going across town going to the other fast food restaurant. Why? To keep wages down. And so what's happening now is, all of a sudden, people are having choices. You know, I always thought the free market system was not only that there's competition among companies, but, guess what? Companies should have to compete for workers. Guess what? Maybe even pay more money. [Applause] No, look, here's the deal: Moody's, today, went out -- a Wall Street firm, not some liberal think tank -- said if we passed the other two things I'm trying to get done, we will, in fact, reduce inflation. Reduce inflation. Reduce inflation -- because we're going to be providing good opportunities and jobs for people who, in fact, are going to be reinvesting that money back into all the things we're talking about, driving down prices, not raising prices. And so, it is -- I sincerely mean this: Prices are up now, and they're up in -- for example, you're in a position where you're trying to build a house, trying to find two-by-fours and lumber. Well, guess what? People stopped working cutting lumber. They stopped doing it because they -- the unemployment was so down. Now, all of a sudden, there's this need because people are coming back. And guess what? Instead of paying 10 cents, you're paying 20. But you understand what I'm saying. It relates to what, in fact, is now needed because we're growing. I don't know anybody, including Larry Summers -- who's a friend of mine -- who's worried about inflation, is suggesting that there's any long-term march here if we do the things we're going to do. For example, if we get this build on that I've been -- put together a long time ago -- and, by the way, I want to say, I'm in his territory. You know, there's -- Portman is a good man. Portman is a congressman from this area. I talked to him before I got -- and I really mean it. He's a decent, honorable man, and he and I are working on trying to get this -- this infrastructure bill passed. Yeah, I'm sorry. I -- I thought that [inaudible]. I apologize. But -- no -- Yeah, it did. But that's irrelevant. Yeah. Until Monday. [Laughter] Look -- no, I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious. You had up to 20 Republicans sign a letter saying, ""We think we need this deal. We think we need this deal."" And so I think there'll be -- by the way, the reason we're talking this way: We need 60 votes to get something moving. And what's going to happen is, I believe -- because I take my Republican colleagues at my -- at their word when you shake. I come from a tradition in the Senate: You shake your hand. That's it. You keep your word. And I found Rob Portman does that. I found that -- you know, your governor is a good man. You shake his hand, it's done. [Applause] No, I really mean that. I'm not -- I'm not being falsely complimentary. I do. Here's what I think: What happens is, the vote on Monday is a motion to be able to proceed to this issue. Then they're going to debate the issue of the elements -- the individual elements of this plan to sake [sic] sure we're going to fix that damn bridge of yours going into Kentucky. [Applause] No, I'm serious. Anyway. But I think it's going to get done. You may find in the amendments that take place on the detail -- the detail of whether or not -- and I'm the guy that wrote this bill to begin with, and so I've had to compromise to make changes in the bill. When I say ""I,"" I campaigned on this. I mean, everybody thought I was a little nuts when I talked about there are three reasons why I was running: one, to restore the soul of this country and bring back some decency; two, to build back the middle class because they've been getting really knocked around a long time. They're the backbone that unite the country. And one of the big issues was dealing with infrastructure. Remember, the last four years we had ""Infrastructure Week"" every week. We didn't do a thing. But it's necessary. [Laughter] No, I really mean it. It's going to not only increase job opportunities, it's going to increase commerce. It's going to -- it's a good thing, and I think we're going to get it done. Well, look, I may be the wrong guy to talk to because I spent a lot of time as a Senator and Vice President, and I'm going to say something outrageous: I don't know you'll find any Republican I've ever worked with who says I ever broke my word, didn't do exactly what I said I would do and keep my word. And I was able to get an awful lot of compromises put together to do really good things, to change things. And I still believe that's possible. But the well has been so poisoned over the last four years. And even now, there's still this lingering effort. A lot of my Republican friends -- and I'm not talking about Portman; I'm not talking about your governor -- a lot of my Republican friends say, ""Joe, I -- I know you're right, but if I do this, I'll get primaried and I'll lose my primary. I'll be in trouble."" But I think that's all beginning to move. I don't mean overnight. Don't get me wrong, I'm not playing out some panacea here. But I think people are figuring out that if we want to -- I've always found you get rewarded for doing what you think at the time is the right thing, and people really believe you believe it's the right thing to do. And so I think you're seeing it coming together. And, by the way, the compromises are -- you know, are real -- compromise within my own party between the far left and the center and some of the folks who are more conservative. That's coming together. They said that would never happen, but if you notice, it has happened. These people. [Applause] No, I mean it. I'm not being facetious. Democrats and Republicans. I don't care if you think I'm Satan reincarnated. [Laughter] The fact is, you can't look at that television and say, ""Nothing happened on the 6th."" You can't listen to people who say this was a ""peaceful march."" No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think of the things being said. I've been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side. Think about it. Well, no, they can say that, and you can make honest judgments about it. I have -- Look, I sometimes get myself in trouble for what I'm about to say -- [laughter] -- not that I ever get in trouble. [Laughs] As you've heard me say before: No one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. And -- [laughter]. But all kidding aside, I have faith in the American people -- I really do -- to ultimately get to the right place. And, by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place. I don't mean that the Repub- -- that it's always the Democratic point of view. But some of the stuff -- I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and -- no, I'm serious. That's -- Now, you may not like me, and that's your right. Look, it's a simple thing. You can walk out and say, ""I just don't like the way that guy wears his tie. I'm voting against him."" You have a right to do that. You have a right to do that. But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you're beginning to see some of the -- and both -- and by Democrats as well -- sort of the venom get -- sort of -- sort of leak out a lot of it. We got to get beyond this. What do you say to your grandchildren or you children about what's happening? Do you ever remember a time like this before, in the entire history, whether you're Democrat or Republican? This is not who we are. And I'll say one last thing -- and you're going to -- I've had a lot of experience internationally. And I mean that -- not good or bad, just I have; I've chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. I've been deeply involved. I did national security for the -- our last -- the -- the -- the administration with Barack. But, folks, the rest of the world is wondering about us. Those of you who travel abroad -- not a joke, not a joke -- you ask -- you know, when I went to this G7, all the major democracies -- I walked in -- and I know a lot of them because of my role in the past. And they walk in and I said, ""America is back."" And they go -- I'm serious, heads of state -- I give you my word as a Biden -- said, ""Are you really back? I mean, how can I -- we believe you, Joe, but will the country ever get it together?"" I talked to Xi -- Xi Jinping in China, who I know well. We don't agree on a lot of things. He's a bright and really tough guy. He truly believes that the 21st century will be determined by oligarchs, by -- and I'm not -- not a joke. Democracies cannot function in the 21st century -- the argument is -- because things are moving so rapidly -- so, so rapidly that you can't pull together a nation that is divided to get a consensus on acting quickly. So, autocrats -- autocracies -- I had a long meeting with Putin, and I continued -- I know him well. These guys actually are betting -- betting -- I'm not joking -- on autocracies. Democracy has to stand up and demonstrate it can get something done. It's not just important that we are -- [Applause] -- no, I really mean it. I'm sorry. Hey, John. Well, two things. One, if you notice, we kept you open. We spent billions of dollars to make sure restaurants could stay open. And -- and a lot of people who now -- who work as waiters and waitresses decided that they don't want to do that anymore because there's other opportunities and higher wages, because there's a lot of openings now in jobs. And people are beginning to move -- beginning to move. There's some evidence that maintaining the ability to continue not -- to not have your -- have to pay your rent so you don't get thrown out, and being able to provide for unemployment insurance, has kept people from going back to work. There's no -- not much distinction between not going back to work in a restaurant and not going back to work at a -- at a factory. So people are looking to change opportunities, change what they're doing. My -- my deceased wife's father-in-law was a restauranteur up in -- up in Syracuse, New York. And, by the way, he tried to con- -- he had a -- had a restaurant that was in a town called Auburn, about 20,000 people, which was at a flagship 24-hour-a-day restaurant that -- and he offered it to me, which I would have been making five times what I would in law school to try to keep me in Syracuse. But I spent too many times at home hearing a -- in his home, hearing a phone call: ""The cook didn't come in? He's in a fight with his wife? What -- what's going on?"" So I would -- God love you doing what you do. Yeah. Well, John -- first of all, I -- you know, the thing we did to help John and the Johns out is provide billions of dollars to make sure they could stay open. Number one. So you all contributed to making sure John could stay in business. [Applause] And we should. We should have done that, as we did for other industries. But secondly, John, my guess is that people being $7, $8 an hour, plus tips, that -- that's -- I think, John, you're going to be finding -- [Applause] -- 15 bucks an hour or more now. You know what I mean? But you may pay that already. You may pay that already. Well, that was the argument it was. I -- I -- I don't think it did much. But the point is, it's argued that because the extended unemployment benefits kept people --they'd rather stay home and not work -- than go to work. I see no evidence it had any serious impact on it. But you can argue -- let's assume it did. It's coming to an end, so it's not like we're in a situation where -- if that was it and it ends, then we're going to see John is going to have no problem. But what I think is happening, folks, is, look, if you make less than fift- -- and I'm not saying, John, your folks make less than 15 -- you had good restaurants; that means their tips are good, people make a lot more than just what the -- what the minimum wage -- what the wage is being paid on with the -- put tips on top of it. But, folks, look, here's the deal. Think about it: You know, if you have an -- we -- for example, I want to be able to -- one of my programs is to make sure that we have four more years of school that's free -- two years for three-year-olds and four-year-olds, because it's demonstrated that that -- [Applause] -- increases significantly success, and community college. Well, those folks are not likely to want to go and be waiters. There's nothing wrong being a waiter or waitress. My family has been engaged in that business. But the folks is -- And, lastly, if you make less than 15 bucks an hour working 40 hours a week, you're living below the poverty level. You're living below the poverty level. [Applause] By the way, your congressman wants that bridge too. [Laughter] The answer is absolutely, positively yes. [Applause] I'm not just saying that. I'm not just saying that. And if you take a look at Ohio and Kentucky combined, there's well over -- there's thousands of bridges that need repair. Thousands. Thousands of bridges. And we should be looking at it this way: It increases commerce, number one. But guess what? They're good-paying union jobs. Union. [Applause] Union jobs. And -- and -- and, by the way, can you ever think of a time -- those of you who are economists, who are -- who teach here, economics -- can you think of any time when the middle class did better, the wealthy didn't do really well? I'm not being facetious now. I'm being deadly earnest. Can you think of any time that's occurred when the middle class does better? I'm tired of trickle down. I come from the corporate state of America. [Applause] And, by the way, I think you should be able to go out and make a billion dollars or a hundred million dollars if you have the capacity to do it. But I ask one thing: Pay your fair share. [Applause] Just pay your fair share. I really mean it. And if you know anything about me, check it out: We have more corporations registered in Delaware than all the rest of America combined. Combined. Combined. I represented it for 36 years. I've never seen a time when we have the middle class growing that the wealthy didn't do very, very, very well. So, that's what we have to do: Build it out and up, not just down. He's a graduate, huh? Your first year -- you wish you had already graduated. [Laughter] I know. I -- me too. I stand by what I said. Never before has there been an attempt by state legislatures to take over the ability to determine who won. Not count the votes -- determine who won. We have election officials across the board that they're deciding to push out of the way. And if, in fact, tomorrow -- let's say we're running last time and we're -- these laws had been in effect that are -- these changes. In Georgia, the Georgia legislature -- you know, Biden won by multiple thousand votes; they could say, ""We don't think it was legit."" And the state legislature votes, ""We're going send electors up to Congress to vote for Trump, not Biden."" That's never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever been tried before. This is Jim Crow on steroids what we're talking about. And so, it takes -- to go to your second point, I've been saying for a long, long time: The abuse of the filibuster is pretty overwhelming. When I got to the United States Senate at a time when we had guys like Jim Eastland and Strom Thurmond and Robert F. Byrd and a whole range of people who were very, very, very, very, very, very conservative on race, to say the least -- even then, if you were to filibuster, you had to stand on the floor and hold the floor. And that's why Strom, I think, set the record at 24 straight hours or something. Don't hold me to the number. But, you know, so you had to take -- there were significantly fewer filibusters in those days. In the middle of the civil rights movement. Well, let me finish my answer, because I'll tell you what I'd do. I would go back to that where you have to maintain the floor. You have to stand there and talk and hold the floor. [Applause] You can't just say that now. No. It's not. I want to see the United States Congress, the United States Senate, pass S.1 and S.4, the John Lewis Act, and get it on my desk so I can sign it. [Applause] But here's the deal: What I also want to do -- I want to make sure we bring along not just all the Democrats; we bring along Republicans, who I know know better. They know better than this. And what I don't want to do is get wrapped up, right now, in the argument of whether or not this is all about the filibuster or -- Look, the American public, you can't stop them from voting. You tried last time. More people voted last time than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic in American history. More people did. [Applause] And they showed up. They're going to show up again. They're going to do it again. But what I want to do is I'm trying to bring the country together. And I don't want the debate to only be about whether or not we have a filibuster or exceptions to the filibuster or the -- going back to the way the filibuster had to be used before. No, I don't believe that. I think we can get it done. It is. There's no reason to protect it other than you're going to throw the entire Congress into chaos and nothing will get done. Nothing at all will get done. And there's a lot at stake. The most important one is the right to vote. That's the single most important one. And your vote counted, and counted by someone who honestly counts it. But it goes beyond that. For example, wouldn't -- wouldn't my friends on the other side love to have a debate about the filibuster instead of passing the recovery act? Or wouldn't they love doing it instead of being in a position where we provide for -- how many of you have children under the age of 17? Raise your hand. Guess what? You're getting a lot of money in a monthly check now, aren't you? [Applause] No, you deserve -- [Applause] -- no, no, no, I really mean it. Republicans used to fight for it as well. It's called the Child Tax Credit. If you have a child under the age of seven, you get 300 bucks a month -- 350 bucks a month. If you have a child under -- between 7 and 17, you get a total of 200 bucks a month. And guess what? It's cutting child poverty in half. In half. [Applause] I used to be a public defender, kid. Thanks for what you're doing. Now, I'm not being a wise guy. There's no reason you should -- have you seen my gun violence legislation I've introduced? As you know -- because you're so involved -- actually, crime is down; gun violence and murder rates are up. Guns. I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a senator, that made sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon -- whether it's a -- whether it's a 9-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle -- is ridiculous. I'm continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things, but I'm not likely to get that done in the near term. So here's what I've done: The people who, in fact, are using those weapons are acquiring them illegally -- illegally. And so what happens is, I've gotten ATF -- Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms -- I have them increase their budget and increase their capacity, along with the Justice Department, to go after the gun shops that are not abiding by the law of doing background checks. [Applause] For real. That's number one. Number two -- number two, we're in a position where you -- most of the cities -- and I don't know enough -- I think you've had a lot of gun violence here in Cincinnati. I think it was up to -- what? -- how many -- how many how dead? Five hundred over a period. Don't hold me to the number -- whatever it was. But my point is, all across the country. And it's not because the gun shops in the cities are selling these guns. They are either shadow gun dealers and/or gun shops that are not abiding by the law. So, we're going to do major investigations and shut those guys down and put some of them in jail and -- for what they're doing: selling these weapons. There's also a thing called ""ghost guns"" that are being sold now and being used. And so -- but in addition to that, what we have to do is we have to deal with a larger problem of the whole issue of law enforcement, generally. We're in a situation where, as much as we need to pass the Floyd Act and all that -- but here's the deal: Cops are having real trouble. They're not all bad guys; there's a lot of good guys. We need more policemen, not fewer policemen. But we need them involved in community policing. Community policing. [Applause] And when we did that, violent crime went down. All the criticism about the original crime bill -- well, guess what? Crime went down until we stopped doing community policing. So it's about getting -- we have availability now of over billion -- lots of money for cops to be able to hire psychologists, psychiatrists, as well as social workers to be engaged in the process. [Applause] They're lying. [Applause] No, look, never once -- we have to change police conduct. We have to have rules where things are open. We have to have rules where you can be able to determine what the background -- how many times a cop has violated the rules and be able to have access to what's going on in police departments, or the Justice Department can get involved in whether or not they have to change their pattern and practices. I've always said that. No, I've never -- never, never said defunding the police. Look, I don't know any community, particularly the communities that are in the most need and the poorest and the most at risk, that don't want police. They want police, though, to look at them as equals. [Applause] They want police to treat them in a way. They don't want police abusing. And what happened was we got in the position where -- we used to have community policing where the cop -- my deceased son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. And what we did when that original bill got passed was he would go down in the tough neighborhoods in my -- in my state -- in my city of Wilmington, which is overwhelming a minority city, and he'd go where the -- everybody can tell me where the best basketball is played in a playground here in this city. You know where it is; you know who the best ballplayers are; you know where they are. He'd go down and sit there on the bench with his son, my -- my grandson, who's now 16, when he was 5 and 6 years old, and let them know he was there. He'd go over and knock on the window of the local cop, who was sitting there by himself in a squad car. I'd say, ""Get out of the car. Meet people."" Because what used to happen was cops used to -- when first community policing came about -- they'd go in and they knew who the minister was in the church, they knew who owned the local liquor store, the local drugstore, the local grocery store. And they'd walk in and say, ""Look, I'm Joe Biden, and I'm going to be in this beat. Here's my cell number. You have a problem, call me. Here's my cell number."" They aren't saying Joe Biden is anti-police. Cops are not saying that about Joe Biden. They know me, period. [Applause] They're not saying. Republicans are saying it on the far -- I'm not going to -- anyway, it doesn't matter. No, look -- That's exactly right. That's exactly right. Okay -- no, if police aren't doing their job, they should be held accountable. They should be fired if they're not doing their job. They should -- [Applause] -- I have no -- I make no excuses for that. We should have, for example, the George Floyd Act, where chokeholds are against the law, where a whole lot of things that are laid out in that legislation. And, by the way, I grew up in a neighborhood where you became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn't qualified for any one of them, so here I am. [Laughter] But all kidding aside -- I'm not joking -- the guys that grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware -- a steel town -- that's what we did. That's what they did. It's what my friends did. And here's the point: The point is that they -- it doesn't justify maltreating the public. You have no right to do that. None. But now what's happening is, because they've become -- it's become so tough across the spectrum, we've actually cut down on a number of police, unrelated to anybody asking for it. The towns and cities aren't spending as much money on it. There is not as much federal money to hire police. And now, what's happening is police are not wanting to be a cop. Raise your hand if you want to be a cop now. What do you think, huh? So what we got to do is we got to give them the help they need to be better at their job. The idea that you have someone sitting on a ledge, saying they're going to jump off a ledge, and you call the cop, and sending a guy or a woman who's a law enforcement officer, has a criminal justice degree, when you could send with him or her -- you could send with them a psychologist or a social worker, or somebody who can talk to them. No, I mean it. [Applause] I'm serious. They should bear responsibility. You may or may not be aware: Even in the period when I was out of office, I was railing against the fact that drug companies were selling on the open market. There was one case -- what's really got me was you had two drugstores in small town in West Virginia having something like prescription for 4,000 pills. And it was obviously drug trafficking. That's what was going on. So what we did was -- what they did was, they went after it. They just settled with Johnson & -- some of the drug companies who make opioids for twenty-si- -- was it $26 billion or 27. Today, if I'm not mistaken, the settlement took place. But here's the deal: In addition to that, you have the Chinese sending fentanyl to Mexico, in large part, that's being mixed with opioids and/or heroin and other drugs, which is a dead-set killer of people. And so, what we have to do -- I've had this encounter with China, and we're going to continue it. But we've also increased the number of DEA agents -- what we're doing at the border -- and how we're going to deal with ex- -- the intercepting that drug trade. In addition to that, the Justice Department is moving on dealing with the whole opioid issue by increasing significantly the number -- the number of people in Justice Department working on this issue. And so, there's much more to say about it, but it is incredibly, incredibly dangerous. [Inaudible] -- Yes. And I'm so damn proud of my son. My son just wrote a book about how he overcame being addicted. And he did it, and he's doing it, and he is in good shape, thank God. Here's the thing: We don't have nearly enough people involved in mental health and drug addiction services -- number one. [Applause] Number one. Number two -- number two, we shouldn't be sending people to jail for use; we should be sending them to mandatory rehabilitation. [Applause] Mandatory rehabilitation. Number three, when people are in fact in jail, they should be getting -- if that's not the main crime, but they also did -- they should be getting treatment while they are in jail. Fourth, when people get out of jail -- whether it's for drug addiction or any other crime -- if they've served their time, they should have full access to everything from Pell Grants, to public housing, to -- to the like. [Applause] And, by the way -- and, by the way, folks, it's not just the right thing to do; it's the smart thing for us to do. Because what happens? Years ago, there was a guy named Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania. He and I introduced legislation that was a second chance. It would -- meant that, right now, when you get out of jail in most prisons in the states around the country -- what happens? -- you get a bus ticket and 25 bucks. You end up under the bridge, just like you did before. You're almost -- almost guaranteed to get back in -- in whatever -- whatever your problem was before. So, they should have access to drug treatment. They should have access to housing. They should have access to whatever they qualify based on their income. And we should, in prisons as well, be training people differently. But the mi- -- the big thing here is: We have to deal with the idea of addiction by providing for what we all know -- it's a disease of the brain. It's a disease of the brain and has to be treated as such. I agree. Hi, Madeena. Yes. They should not come. What we're trying to set up is, in the countries like in -- and particularly in the Northern Triangle -- Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, et cetera -- we are setting up in those countries: If you seek asylum in the United States, you can seek it from the country, from your -- in place. You can seek it from an American embassy. You can go in and seek and see whether or not you qualify. We've significantly increased the number of officers who can hear cases as to whether or not you qualify under the law for being here as a refugee. That is -- that's what we've done. Thirdly, we have enabled a move, significantly, to change the number -- there were thousands of people in -- in custody with the Border Patrol. It's now cut by 90 percent, where there -- it's considerably down. What I -- what I do say is: The one place you may heard that I'm talking about more immigrants coming in are those folks from Afghanistan who helped the American soldiers, who will be -- they and their family will be victimized very badly as a consequence of what happens if they're left behind. And so, we're providing for them to be able to see whether they qualify to meet this special requirement to be able to come to the United States as a refugee and as, ultimately, earning citizenship here. It seems to me it's the only decent thing that we can do. In the meantime, we're going to send people to American bases, where they're not going to be able to leave the base while their cases are being determined -- whether they qualify -- and also other bases. I'm not letting this go. Look, guys, let's just put it -- [Applause] -- let's just put this -- you know, we talk about DREAMers sort of generically. Let's think about it now, what it really means: You're five years old. You're nine years old. Your mom or your dad says, ""I'm going to take you across the Rio Grande and we're going to illegally going to go into the United States."" What are you supposed to say? ""Not me. That's against the law""? I'm --no, I'm being -- I'm being deadly earnest. What can a kid say? What could they do? They come here with really no choice. And they're here, and they're good, good people. They've done well. [Applause] Ten thousand of them were first-line workers. [Applause] These are kids who've done well. And so, what we're going to do is, first of all, appeal the case -- number one. But number two, we're going to make sure that -- a number of my Republican colleagues say they support the right of DREAMers to come. Let's call the question. They should be able to stay in the United States of America when a child comes [inaudible]. [Applause] Yeah. ""Mr. President, you didn't close the door. Mr. President, what the hell are you going out at this time for?"" You know. [Laughter] You know, it's -- it's a wonderful honor. As you can tell, I hope I have very good manners, but I'm not very hung up on protocol. [Laughter] And I -- and the Secret Service is wonderful. And because things are so -- [Applause] -- and because things are so crazy out there, it is very hard to get comfortable like I would ordinarily be. For example, I think all of the -- all the help that's there, providing meals and all the rest -- I think they love us. We can say, ""Don't come in for breakfast. We can get our own breakfast."" Because I like to walk out in my robe and go in. [Laughter] No, no, I'm not -- you think I'm joking. I'm not. You know what I mean? And so it's just a -- you know, the only place I have felt like what the office connotes is when I went to Europe and watched the rest of the heads of state react to me -- not me, because I'm the President of the United States of America -- the United States of America. And here's what happened: It's the first time I ever felt like -- you always hear say ""leader of the free world."" Well, I realize, when I'm sitting across from Putin, who I know, he knows who I am; I know who he is. He knows I mean what I say and can do what I say. He understands. It doesn't mean he will do it or not do it. But the point is it's the first time I've ever felt the notion that I am in the office that is the leader of the free world. And we must be the leader of the free world. If we don't do it, nobody good is likely to do it or has the capacity to do it. I really mean it. I genuinely mean it. So, it's the thing, Don, that is the only time -- and, by the way, the first time I walked downstairs and they played ""Hail to the Chief,"" I wondered, ""Where is he?"" [Laughter] No, you think I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. You know, I mean -- It's a great tune, but I -- you know, you feel a little self-conscious. [Laughter] But you think I'm kidding. I'm not. But I am -- I am not at all self-conscious about the power that goes with the office as it relates to resolving issues. These are issues that I've dealt with my whole life. Whether I'm good or bad, I have more experience coming to the office than anyone who's ever held that office. I have done -- I've -- I've been deeply steeped in foreign policy, the justice system, the econo- -- not that I'm right. I don't mean that. But nothing has come before me where I've gone, ""Oh, my God, I never -- I never thought... "" You know, what the difference is -- I used to kid Barack -- he's a good friend -- President Obama. And, you know, at one point, I'd always be the -- I was always the last guy in the room, for real. On every important decision, I got to give my advice. I'd give it all away, but I'd be the last guy before I walked out. And one day, he thanked me. And I said, ""Mr. President, here's the deal: I should be paying you, not you me, because I get to give the advice, and then I get to leave."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it. The one thing that is real, that is different -- I don't -- and I feel comfortable with it -- but is you're the last guy in the room. You decide, ""Is the decision I'm about to make, will that cause war? Will that cause conflict? The decision I'm about to make, is that going to hurt people? Is it going to help people?"" That's the part that is different. But the living conditions, I mean, it's such a great, great honor to live in the White House. But, quite frankly -- I kid the Vice President -- like, one day, Barack came over to NAVOBS -- it's called Naval Operations [sic] -- the Vice President's Residence -- which is on about, I guess, 80, 90 acres. And it's a beautiful, beautiful spot. And there's a fence around the whole property. I do. [Laughter] And Barack came over and he said, ""This is great."" And I said, ""I'll tell you... "" And I said, ""Trade you only if the power goes with it."" But the point is that, there, it was totally different. You could walk out in your shorts -- with a short-sleeve shirt on, and you can walk around and there wasn't anybody there. You can't walk out anywhere now. [Laughter] But I'm not complaining. I'm trying to answer your question as honestly as I can. I just -- it's the greatest honor, I think, could ever be bestowed on an American that a majority of American citizens said, ""I want you to lead the country."" And it's a great honor -- a great honor when you have presidents and prime ministers and the rest of the world saying, ""You know, what does the United States think?"" You're the leader of the free world. I was able to go to the G7 and change their mind about a whole range of things. They never once had included China in any criticism on what was going on. They're very reluctant to be able to be in a position -- you and I have talked about this -- about whether or not they're going to do business with China in a way that, you know, pushes America aside. All of a sudden, if you notice, we're getting a great deal -- not because of me, but because of the administration I put together. And America is back; traditional America is more back. And they're willing to follow us, I think. [Applause] Uh-oh. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. [Applause]"
Joe Biden,"I do. Well, first of all, thank you for doing this, and you make me miss being a professor at Penn. When I left the vice presidency, I had a chance to do a number of things, but I took a professorship at the University of Pennsylvania, presidential politics and history, so I -- I envy you. Oh, no, no, it is. It is. But it's also I really enjoyed teaching and writing. As history professor, you probably think similarly that I do. There are certain periods in world history where you reach inflection points, where things change, not necessarily because of the individuals that are involved, but because of the circumstance and how the world has changed. I think we're at one of those moments in world history where we're going to see more change because of technology than -- in the next ten years than your students will have seen and than we saw in the last 50 years. And I think it's hard for governments to get their arms around these changes in -- in a way that continues to bring people together. If I can give me an example. I've spent, they tell me, more time — I'm not sure it's true — with Xi Jinping than any world leader has, about 35, 36 hours, 28 of them in person. And he believes, for example, as Putin does, who was not as articulate, that in the second quarter of the 21st century, democracies can't compete with autocracies because things are changing so rapidly; that democracies require consensus, and it's too hard to get consensus, and that's why they're going to fall behind. I held the conference of world democracies. And we have, as you know, as a -- as a professor of history, fewer democracies today in the world than we did 20 years ago. So, what's happening? What's happening is, as we're able to move more rapidly from -- between cultures and among cultures, it's awful hard bringing people together. Oh, again, I'll go back to Xi. I was with him. I traveled 17,000 miles with him, a lot of it in China, and we'd have these one-on-one meetings, each with an interpreter with us. And we were in -- on the tip, I think, it was the Tibetan Plateau at the time. And he asked me, ""So, can you define America for me?"" I said, ""Yes, in one word, one word: possibilities."" Literally, think about it, we're the only nation in the world, and the reason why we're sort of viewed as -- as having a sense of arrogance by many, is we think we can do anything. Anything's possible in America. Just bring people together, anything's possible. And we're also the most unique country in the history of the world because we're uniquely a product of our institutions, and they're being brought about as a consequence of how we were organized. We weren't organized based on religion or race or ethnicity or geography. Think about it. We're the only nation that came about as a consequence of an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, life, liberty. We've never fully lived up to it. We've never walked away from it. We've never abandoned that idea. And it's getting harder and harder as the differences that we have are accentuated rather than what we really are about are brought together. I decided I was never going to run for president again. I'd lost my son, Beau. I didn't want to be engaged any longer. And I wrote a book about Beau. He was the attorney general, he was a major in the United States Army, he won the Bronze Star. He was a hell of a guy. And he came home from a year in Iraq with a brain tumor called glioblastoma. I remember toward the end, he lived for about 14 months, and he said, we're having dinner at his home, which is not far from mine. And he said, ""Dad,"" he said, ""Look at me. Look at me, Dad."" That's what he -- he said, ""Dad, are you going to be OK?"" Because we know what's going to happen. I said, ""Yeah, I'm going to be OK."" He said, ""Promise me, Dad. Give me your word you're going to be OK."" Well, I knew what he meant was he wanted me to stay engaged. He was afraid when he passed that I'll crawl in a hole, figuratively speaking. The reason I bothered to tell you that is that I think that we really have an enormous opportunity in this moment of change to reassert the basic premise of why we were a country in the first place and to bring people together. And as I said, when I ran, I ran for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of this country, and I meant -- I'm criticized for saying that. But the sense of decency and honor, the values we all shared. We gather our backgrounds. I come from Irish immigrants. Black slaves, immigrants from Asia. I mean, we're so different. We're such a heterogeneous group. But we -- we all kind of share this notion that anything's possible. I mean, think about it, we really have. And so, I ran for three reasons. To restore the basic values that all Americans share and why they come in the first place. Secondly, to rebuild the backbone of the country. The middle class is being killed. They're being killed. And thirdly, to unite the country, which is maybe the hardest people thought doing. So, that's what everything's been about for me, because I'm confident, absolutely confident that the principles upon which we were founded are the principles upon which we can, in fact, remain the most envied nation in the world, the most decent nation in the world. Well, I didn't. I focus first on the recovery legislation, which was the largest single piece of legislation ever passed, $1.9 trillion. Because I knew that the most fundamental thing we had to do is gain control of this disease called COVID. We've lost almost a million people to COVID. It's astonishing. And so, the funding for that was out of that. And secondly, and I knew what we had to do is we had one of the highest unemployment rates we've had before. People were not only unemployed, their salaries were cratering. The spread between those at the very top -- I mean, you had the top two percent getting 90 percent. I mean, it just we -- we hadn't been there since the '20s with that kind of spread. And so, I was convinced we had to narrow that gap. And overlaying all of this was this gigantic thing called global warming. And it's real. I introduced the first piece of global -- global warming legislation in 1987, but we're in real trouble. We have -- we know -- we're in a situation where if we can't stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius in terms of the Earth warming, we're -- we're in trouble. It's the greatest existential threat America -- the world has ever faced. I mean, it's real. And so, what I did was focus on those things, as well as the -- and that's why we also had this massive investment in infrastructure. Because with the infrastructure proposals that we have, you know, we -- you know, for the first time, we're going to be in a position to deal with the fact that people are drinking water that is -- has lead in it, that we're in a situation where the environment is being degraded. And so, it always is -- always critically important in terms of the -- the quality of life for America and, I think, for the rest of the world as well. And the last piece was the Build Back Better piece. What people don't realize because -- mainly because one senator from West Virginia talks about how it's all social spending. Well, you know, of the money in the Build Back Better provisions, there is about -- 500 billion of it is for the environment, 500 billion is for the environment. But the other parts are for the best way to deal with people who have been getting the short end of the stick, as they say, for a long time. For example, we do have inflation because of supply chain problems, and that's because of COVID in a -- in a big way. But if you want to reduce the burden of people who are struggling to pay for a gallon of gas and make sure that they have enough food on the table to eat, they can afford to walk in a grocery store, and the shelves are full, there's other ways to reduce the overall -- increase their overall standard of living that ends up those factors being important but more affordable while you're dealing with -- for example, one of the things I did in the original legislation that we passed, the recovery piece of it, was provide for, which a lot of people were working on more than I had, but I got it done in the legislation, the child care tax credit. Well, that reduced child poverty by 40 percent. And it wasn't a welfare program. It was a tax cut. Well, first of all, you're giving me more credit maybe than I deserve. But I think it's fair, and I like to believe that. So, let me give you an example. I didn't realize, although I've been a senator for a long time and vice president for eight years, that on January the 20th, the incoming president has to, from 11 o'clock on the 20th to 1 o'clock in the 20th, to change the Oval Office and put the desk in here that she wants and the furniture they want, etc. So, my brother's my best buddy, and he has been down all my campaigns. And I said -- and he has great taste. And I said, Jimmy, fix my -- you decide what to do. So, he brought in a good friend of ours, and he got him. Jon Meacham, who, you know is this -- Presidential historian. And so, I walked into the office and it was easier because the other president didn't even show up for the inauguration or anything, so -- anyway, the day I walk into the office, which I've been in every day for eight years with President Obama and then many more, instead of having a traditional picture of George Washington over the mantelpiece, there's large portrait of Franklin Roosevelt. And to the left -- I didn't do this. And to the left, there are four other portraits. On the right side of the fireplace over here, this is not the room, obviously, there is a picture of Jefferson and Madison, idea of state and local government. What -- you know, where does the power flow from, right? And on the left side was George Washington, a smaller portrait of him, and Abraham Lincoln. So, I said to Jon, ""why Roosevelt?"" And he said, ""because no one's ever come into this office as far behind the eight ball economically as you other than Roosevelt, and you're going have to figure a way out."" And I said, ""well, why Lincoln?"" He said, ""no one's ever come into office with the nation more divided than you or than Abraham Lincoln."" And, by the way, he spent a lot of time in the Roosevelt Room, which is across from the Oval Office, which is the most -- I'll show you. I'll walk you upstairs and show you the room if you've not been in it. You probably have. Well, it's Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. And Teddy Roosevelt understood that we owed so much to posterity and that -- I mean, you think about what he did just with the national parks. He wasn't the first one, Grant was, but think about what he did. And for our progeny, he believed there was an obligation to pass on the treasures, both material and figurative treasures of the United States. And Roosevelt, he decided that the way to build the country back up was to build it from the bottom and middle out. I think there's those moments in American history where you go from Coolidge to Roosevelt, in that era, where government was the problem and the government was the answer. And then you go from, you know, Reagan to me. I mean, it's a similar kind of transition. Two reasons; because I still believe that the vast majority of Americans believe that the -- they don't think of the founding principles. They think that the United States is all about, at its root, being decent and honorable that they think that there isn't anything we can't do if we work together. There's never -- when we're united, we can do anything. And I think that we're going to find that one of the things that has happened, one of those inflection points was because things are changing so rapidly, people weren't quite sure how to grapple with it. So, the best way to win was by division; to go out and, you know, I tell you what, you know, the only way I can lift myself up is hold you down. And the same thing occurred internationally where this administration, like others around the world, have decided that, you know, it's whatever is good for America, only good for America, that's it. We don't think about anyone else or anything else. And it's this sort of phony populism. I sort of come out of the, politically and intellectually, out of the civil rights movement. I got involved in politics because of civil rights. I was the only white guy working in the east side of Wilmington. I was a lifeguard. I got engaged with a lot of -- I got involved with the community as things were -- As change was taking place, genuine change. And I used to think that you could defeat hate. But all you can do is -- all hate does is hide. When I was a chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I took great pride in the fact that I was able to extend the Voting Rights Act by 25 years, and I got Strom Thurmond to vote for it. Things were changed. Well, what I realize is hate just hides under rocks. What happens is when people come along and breathe oxygen into it, it comes roaring back out. Well, one of the ways to gain power is to pit people against one another based on things having nothing to do other than race, ethnicity, background, white supremacy. You know, I mean, all those things. America began to lose its way a little bit. And the America first notion that -- you know, what's good for America -- we don't care about any of our agreements we made and any alliances. America first. We do it my way or we're not going to do it. That's never how we've operated before. And so, I think what we're beginning to see is, I believe, is the notion that like, for example, in foreign policy, you -- when I walked in, you said it's been an interesting busy day, both with what's happening in Ukraine and a Supreme Court justice being named. Well, it's kind of fascinating when you think about what's going on internationally. How do we get to the place where, you know, Putin decides he's going to just invade Russia? Nothing like this has happened since World War II. I mean, Russia is going to invade Ukraine. And I think -- I think the problem has been that we have been so divided as our European democracies and other democracies. So, I've spent all my time just trying to bring them back together again so we're on the same page. And the way to deal with autocracy, the way -- the way to deal with dictators is united, united front among our allies. And so, everything I've done has been designed to bring the G-7 back together and bring the EU, bring -- and now, now, we're united. And it's going to be very difficult for the autocrats to succeed, in my view. But there's so much more to do. But the point is bringing nations and people together. And that's why in my administration, I -- I -- I think it's fair to say -- I know it's accurate numerically. We have the most diverse administration in American history. More women than men in our administration by 50-some -- 52 or whatever percent. More African American judges has been appointed, not just Supreme Court, but all through the lower courts as well. When you have 24 out of every 100 students in the grade schools in America speaking Spanish, Spanish speakers, how in God's name is it not in the interest of the United States to reach down and lift those people up, just like Irish immigrants in the 1800s or just like Italians after World War II? I mean -- And so, I think people are beginning to realize that. Well, I think it is. I hope I'm doing it well, but I think that it's critically important. I can't -- there was no time since the late '20s where there's been a such an enormous concentration of wealth. Democracies can't be sustained when you got the top -- for example, we have -- you know, during the period of the recession that Trump got us into, we're in a situation where the loss of income to people, middle class and working class, Americans is astonishing. But guess what? In the past two years, the 736 billionaires have made over a trillion additional dollars. And they're not -- They -- they're not necessarily bad folks, but the way the system is lined up, there's no way for the average person to sort of get back in the game. And so one of the things, I think, if you -- what gives me some -- some hope of we can not end up just being a demagogue here in exercise is you have liberals, moderates, Republicans who are mildly conservative, all agreeing on one thing, ""Taxes is not fair, man. It's not fair."" You get unity on that when you start to talk about fairness and just -- just an even shot. The bottom line is people just know it's kind of rigged right now, and a lot of it happened, not even intentionally. A lot of it happened because some really smart people were figuring out how to beat the system and it just got baked into the system. And we kind of looked around like ""What the devil's going on?"" And all of a sudden people wake up and say, ""Wait a minute."" And my dad used to say that, you know, all everybody deserves just a shot. Give the average American a shot, they've never let the country down. I mean, they really haven't, ever, let the country down. And I think it's about getting ordinary people like the family I came from sort of back in the game, not to become millionaires and billionaires but just to be able as my dad would say. I -- I remember we were poor. My dad ran an automobile agency. I didn't know that he ran it. And he probably made about, in those days, $20,000 a year, which was not a bad income. And in the early when we were in high school, making a thousand dollars a month wasn't a bad income. It was tight. But we lived in a three-bedroom house with four kids, our grandpop living with us, and mom and dad. They -- they lost -- we lost their health insurance. And it made me realize that things -- if it don't register, here's -- here's a guy figuring out, ""How, in God's name, I'm going to take care of my family?"" Or today, you know, I mean, one of the reasons I'm pushing, and I'm not unique in this, a lot of people are pushing it, that, you know, Medicare can negotiate drug prices for the VA, but not for anyone else. And -- and so, for example, it takes about 10 bucks to -- to produce a vial, a medicine that is going to keep someone with Type 1 diabetes alive. And it costs, on average, about $640 a month to buy that -- buy that drug. You can easily reduce that price to $15 per vial, and they'll still make a profit of 50 percent. And -- but -- and my dad would say, ""It's not just about that -- those 200,000 kids with Type 1 diabetes, but how about if you're a mom or dad?"" You don't have insurance. You can't pay for the drug. And addition to your child being in trouble, you're deprived of your dignity, you're deprived of your sense of -- of yourself of being worthy. How do you look at your child knowing you can't -- you can't take care of that child? I know, I bet, but I really mean it. I just think these are really important notions and concepts that the vast majority of people think. And -- and these people are busting their neck to try to get things done. And until Barack passed the Affordable Care Act, and insurance companies could say, you've outrun your coverage. I couldn't imagine what I would have done if I were a parent, and they came in and said, you've outrun your coverage, die in peace. These are the things that many, many Americans were facing before, but part of the problem is helping people figure out how to navigate their future in terms of being able to provide just basic things for their families. Bingo. Exactly right. A critically important point to make. It really is. And one of the things I feel I haven't been able to do is connect what we've done with people's lives. I'm a person who, I can tell you or two, who learns more by looking at you, listening to what you're telling me, understanding what you're feeling than -- than I do any other way. And because of COVID, we've not been out doing what we call rope lines, you know, shaking hands and people make -- talking to audiences, walking and listening to their concerns, their fears, their anger. And -- and being able to go out and talk about what was -- has been done. This is what we did, and this is why you're going to be able to do the following. This is why we did, and this is why, this is the place we're going to be able to help you get to school. It's complicated stuff. And most people -- I feel guilty that I haven't been able to go out and expose or sell what we've done, and let people know what we've done. Barack Obama did a really incredible thing with the Affordable Care Act. I was there with him, but he did it. But the Republicans running for office at the time they were all against -- they want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. So, I'm in the last year, I'm not running again for office, I'm out of office. But I agreed to go into, I think it was 57 Republican districts, incumbents to support Democrats because all of a sudden people began to realize. I didn't realize because I don't have -- I have -- they can't take away my insurance it's because I have Obamacare. And so, I can't, you know, I can't be denied the up -- if I have a preexisting condition, they can't eliminate me from getting insurance. And all of a sudden people realized, whoa. So, we went out and did all those 50 some districts, and all we did was talk about one thing. The reason why your preexisting condition is covered is because of Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. People went, huh? They didn't even know it, that anything to do with the affordable -- understanding, I mean, they're stupid or anything. They're trying to put three squares on a table. But when I realized, guess what? We won back the House of Representatives. We won -- I forget it was like 30 some seats or maybe, no, 42 seats I think we won. I can't remember, but a lot. And one thing that's all that we talked about, we went to districts where the Republicans said, we want to do with the Affordable Care Act. And we said to people, do you realize what that means? If you have a preexisting condition, you can't get insurance now, you -- even if you have money to pay for it, you can get it. Because you have preexisting conditions, they're not going to get it. So, a lot of us letting people know what happened and -- and I'm hoping that's why I'm so anxious to get on the road and make the case and find out maybe what -- some of the stuff I'm doing people don't like and it's not working like I think it is. I think it is. But, you know, maybe we'll get out and make the case. I agree. Well, thank you. Thank you. "
Joe Biden,"Well, first of all, I won't even be able to meet the July 4th deadline unless people listen, wear masks, wash their hands and socially distance because not everyone by July 4th will have been vaccinated. [Not Broadcast] There's enough vaccine -- I -- we -- we've been able to purchase enough vaccine, George, with a lotta -- a lotta heavy liftin' for over six hundred -- well over 600 million doses to take care of more than 300 million Americans, some of 'em single dose.  But I hope that what I'm reading about 30% of Republican men say they won't get the vaccine and people are talkin' about whether they ne -- I mean, you have to -- one, when -- when it's available to, get the vaccine, number one. [Not Broadcast] Number two, stay socially distanced. Number three, wear a mask when you're out in public. And we'll get by this and we'll get by it much quicker than we otherwise -- [Not Broadcast] -- would. [Not Broadcast] I have no idea what kind of influence he has anymore. I'm not bein' facetious. I just don't know, George. He got the vaccine. He got the vaccine before he -- he left Washington. And so I hope people understand. Now, one of the hardest things we're doin', George, is in communities not far from here, there's a lot of poor communities that don't have access to a lot of opportunities. [Not Broadcast] They've been hit very hard by the COVID experience. They've been dying at -- at more rapid rate when they contract it. They contract at a more rapid rate than the white community. And that's why we opened up to tens of thousands of drug stores across the country because there's many in almost every neighborhood, and federal health clinics that are in the areas, that are in the most hard-hit areas. [Not Broadcast] So we gotta reach out and make sure people who either don't have computers, don't know how to get online -- that they're able to get the vaccine. I honest to God thought we had it out. I honest to God thought that, once we -- we guaranteed we had enough vaccine for everybody, things would start to calm down. Well, they have calmed down a great deal. But I don't quite understand, you know, the sorta -- I don't wanna -- I just don't understand this sort of macho thing about, ""I'm not gonna get the vaccine. I have a right as an American, my freedom to not do it."" Well, why don't you be a patriot? Protect other people. Well, it's changed because I can hug my grandkids now. They come over to the house. I can see them. I'm able to be with them. I've had the vaccine. I've had it. And, secondly -- it has changed my life in the sense that I've been able to demonstrate to other people that, [Begin Video Edit] you know, I mean, [End Video Edit] I doubt whether people would expect me to take it if I didn't think it was safe -- to make the case that it is safe to take the vaccine. It's important to take the vaccine. Yup. Well, first of all, there was a surge the last two years. In '19 and '20 there was a surge as well. No, well, it could be. But here's the deal.  [Begin Video Edit] We're sending back people to -- [End Video Edit] First of all, the idea that Joe Biden said, ""Come"" because -- I -- I heard the other day that they're coming because, you know, I'm a nice guy and I won't do what -- -- Trump did. Yeah. Well, here's the deal. They're not. The adults are being sent back, number one. [Begin Video Edit] That's number one. [End Video Edit] Number two, what do you do with an unaccompanied child that comes to the border? Do you repeat what Trump did? Take them from their mothers, move them away, hold them in cells, etcetera? We're not doin' that. So what we're doin' is we have brought in -- brought in HHS and also brought in FEMA to provide for enough safe facilities for them to not -- to get out of control of the Border Patrol, which was not designed to hold people for long periods of time, particularly children. Get them out of those facilities. And most of them come with a phone number -- so what we're doing is we're putting together an entire organizational structure so that, within seven days, they're gonna be able to get on the phone, contact that number, find out whether there is a mother or a father, whether it is safe, whether it is a secure circumstance to get the child to that adult. [Not Broadcast] Well, what you get -- what you have to do is you have to try to get control of the mess that was inherited. And the way to get control of the mess that was inherited -- I mean, look, here's what the plan is. You may remember when we had this unaccompanied children at the border when Barack was president, he called me back, I was in Turkey and said, ""You gotta take care of this."" And I was able to get a bipartisan bill passed for almost $800 billion to go to the root cause of why -- why people are leaving. [Not Broadcast] Why are they leaving El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras? Because they're in terrible circumstance, either because of natural disasters and hurricanes, gangs or violence. They're tryin' to escape. And that's why they're coming. So what I did, I spent close to 100 hours with the leaders of those three countries and the U.N. making sure that we're -- for example, in one of the major cities down there, they said the crime rate's terrible. [Not Broadcast] That's why people are leaving this particular city. ""But we have no street lighting."" And the government said, ""Give us the money to put in --"" I said, ""I'm not gonna give you the money. But I'll tell you what. Show me what you need. I'll get contractors down there. We'll put in the street lights for you,"" because there's a lotta corruption down there. [Not Broadcast] And guess what? Violence came down in that city. Yes. I can say quite clearly don't come over. And the process of getting set up, and it's not gonna take a whole long time, is to be able to apply for asylum in place. So don't leave your town or city or community. We're gonna make sure we have facilities in those cities and towns run [Begin Video Edit] by department of -- [Begin Video Edit] by DHS and also access with HHS, the Health and Human Services, to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now. Make your case. We'll have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That's the best way to do this. In addition to that, while we also change the circumstances on the ground in those communities, you're gonna diminish the reason why people want to leave in the first place. [Not Broadcast] It's not like someone's sitting in Guadalajara right now in Mexico, which is not the biggest problem right now, and saying, ""I got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have, give it to a coyote, give him our kids, take 'em across the border. Leave 'em in a desert where they don't speak the language. Won't that be fun?"" That's not why people come. [Not Broadcast] They come because their circumstance is so bad. Now, some come because they want a better opportunity, for economic reasons. They don't qualify. And so in the meantime, what we should be doing is making sure we provide beds for these children. By the way, over 50 percent children coming are ages 16 and 17. 16 and 17. They're not -- most of 'em are not little babies. 1% are young -- young kids. [Not Broadcast] And so what we're doing now is we're providing for -- in the past, what you do is HHS would take them to licensed providers, so there's beds, security, where there's health care, they're fed, they're cared for, while they determine whether or not there is someone in the United States they're entitled to go to. [Not Broadcast] And that's what we're in the process of doing now. We will have, I believe, by next month enough of those beds to take care of these children who have no place to go. But they need to be taken care of while they're -- but the vast majority -- let's get somethin' straight though. The vast majority of people crossin' the border are being sent back. [Not Broadcast] Are being sent back, immediately sent back. Well, look, one of the things that, if you notice the criticism of the COVID relief package from my Republican friends, is they say it spends too much money and it gives too many tax breaks. Well, 60% of all these tax breaks go -- all these tax breaks go to the bottom 60% of the population. And guess what? They need it. The $1,400 check. Child care tax credit, the ability to provide for -- we cut child poverty in half, literally in half in the United States of America. They don't like it because in fact their -- their idea of a tax cut is give the Trump tax cut, where 83% went to the top 1% of the people in America. Yes. Anybody making more than $400,000 will see a small to a significant tax increase. If you make more than -- less than $400,000, you won't see a fed -- one single penny in additional federal tax. I brought this with me 'cause I often get asked and I don't wanna misquote it. If you take a look at the corporate tax rate under Trump, if you raise the tax rate back up to what we thought it should be, it was at 35%, they brought it down to 21%. Bring it to 28%. That raises $800 billion. You have now 90 of the Fortune 500 companies don't pay a single penny in federal tax.  [Begin Video Edit] Not a penny. Making billions of dollars. [End Video Edit] Oh, I may not get -- but I'll get the Democratic votes for a tax increase. [Begin Video Edit] And -- there're some Republicans who do have consc -- look -- also, we know -- [End Video Edit]  -- if we just took the tax rate back to what it was when Bush was president, top rate paid 39.8 per se -- 39.6% in federal taxes. That would raise $230 billion. Yet, we're -- they're complaining because I'm providing -- a tax credit for child care? For the poor, for the middle class? Keeping people -- and by the way, my proposal in the relief plan I put forward, it creates seven million jobs according to a whole range of people, including -- Moody's and Wall Street, number one. Increases the GDP by over $1 trillion, actually raises -- raises income in America, and diminishes debt in America. I mean, what are these -- -- guys talking about -- Yes. But here's the choice. I don't think you have to eliminate the filibuster. You have to do it what it used to be when I first got to the Senate back in the old days when you used to be around there. And that is that a filibuster -- you had to stand up and command the floor. And you had to keep talkin' along. You couldn't call for, you know -- no one could say, you know, quorum call. Once you stopped talkin', you lost that and someone could move in and say, ""I move the question of."" So you gotta work for the filibuster. I am. That's what it was supposed to be. Look, I think -- don't hold me to the numbers, George, but I think between 1960 and 2000, there were l -- I'm makin' this number up. I don't know. There were, like -- you know, 50 filibusters. Now there're, like, 200 since then, since that rule tanked -- Yeah. I mean, you know, so the idea -- it almost is gettin' to the point where there's -- you know, democracy's having a hard time functioning. A hard time functioning. And so, look, I'm not sayin' this is gonna be easy, George. But I do believe there's enough Republicans over time who are gonna have -- look, you -- you -- No, no. Well, I've only been here six weeks, pal, okay? Gimme a break. [Laughs] Been here six weeks. I think the epiphany's gonna come in twenty -- between now and 2022. There's 78% of the people say they support this program. 52% of Republicans. Let's assume it's off by 15%. You're gonna go home and cap a -- Republican voters want that $1,500 because they're in trouble. Republican voters want to be able to choose between being able to send their -- go to work and send their kid to a daycare that they can afford. Republican voters wanna be able to take care of a child care tax credit. I mean, these are -- it's not like -- every Republican is you know, a billionaire. You know, they're -- by the way -- I'm not saying it will cha -- I'll do it again, but I want those Republican voters in suburbia. He will pay a price. I, we had a long talk, he and I, when we -- I know him relatively well. And I -- the conversation started off, I said, ""I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared."" I did say that to him, yes. And -- and his response was, ""We understand one another."" [Begin Video Edit] It was -- [End Video Edit]  I wasn't being a wise guy. I was alone with him in his office. And that -- that's how it came about. It was when President Bush had said, ""I looked in his eyes and saw his soul."" I said, ""Looked in your eyes and I don't think you have a soul."" And looked back and he said, ""We understand each other."" Look, most important thing dealing with foreign leaders in my experience, and I've dealt with an awful lot of 'em over my career, is just know the other guy. [Begin Video Edit]  Don't expect somethin' that you're -- that -- don't expect him to -- or her to -- voluntarily appear in the second editions of Profiles in Courage. [End Video Edit] Uh-huh. I do. The price he's gonna pay we'll -- you'll see shortly. I'm not gonna -- there's -- by the way, we oughta be able that ol' -- that trite expression ""walk and chew gum at the same time,"" there're places where it's in our mutual interest to work together. That's why I renewed the start agreement with him. That occurred while he's doin' this. But that's overwhelmingly in the interest of humanity, that we diminish the prospect of a nuclear exchange. [Not Broadcast] But that and SolarWinds as well. He's been -- they've done some mischievous things, to say the least. And so we're gonna have -- I'm not gonna announce what I'm doing, but he's gonna understand that -- [Not Broadcast] -- it's not free. [Not Broadcast] Well -- [Not Broadcast] Three things. One, I'm the guy that released the report. That report had been done for a while. It wasn't released. I insisted it be released, number one. Number two, when I spoke to the king, I made it clear to the king -- the king, his father, that things were gonna change. And I insisted on several things. [Not Broadcast] Number one, we held accountable all the people in that organization -- [Not Broadcast] Not the crown prince because we have never, that I'm aware of, when we have an alliance with a country, gone to the acting head of state and punished that person. And -- and -- ostracized him. But here's the deal. We said, number one, end the war in Yemen. End the starvation there. Number two -- and I went down the list of the things we expected the Saudis to do. [Not Broadcast] And they're in the process of doing those things. And if they don't, we're gonna -- it's a changed relationship. It's a changed relationship we have with Saudi Arabia. There's no blank check. I'm in the process of making that decision now as to when they'll leave. The fact is that -- that was not a very solidly negotiated deal that the president, the former president -- worked out. And so we're in consultation with our allies as well as the government. And -- that decision's gonna be -- it's in process now. I don't think a lot longer. Could happen, but it -- it is tough beca -- look, one of the drawbacks, George, and it's gonna be, like, Sanskrit to people listening here, but it is the failure to have an orderly transition from the Trump presidency to my presidency, which usually takes place from Election Day to the time you're sworn in, has cost me time and consequences. For example, we didn't realize how bad things were in terms of lack of vaccines. We didn't realize how -- because we were not -- we were not able to get access to this information. That's part of -- that's one of the issues we're talking about now in terms of Afghanistan. Yes. I think he'd probably end up being prosecuted too. Well, that's a judgment for them to make -- whether he can be effective. Here's my position and it's been my position since I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. A woman should be presumed telling the truth and should not be scapegoated and become victimized by her coming forward. Number one. But there should be an investigation to determine whether what she says is true. That's what's going on now. I -- And I say -- That's what I think happens. And, by the way, it may very well be there could be a criminal prosecution that is attached to it. I just don't know. But let the investiga -- and I'm not -- I don't know what it is. But I start with the presumption it takes a lotta courage for a woman to come forward. Some are not -- anyway, takes a lotta courage to come forward. So the presumption is it should be taken seriously. And it should be investigated. And that's what's under way now. [Not Broadcast] Well, there wasn't -- all the -- George, I was thinkin' about this. I was tryin' to explain to somebody the other day. Initially, was a kid when I ran, when I was 43 years old to try to get the nomination. What I thought of was, you know, how do you compare yourself to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt? [Not Broadcast] And it's intimidating. But I thought about it. I've personally known seven presidents well. And I've played in the same teams they played on. And -- there're some with great strengths, more strengths than I have, weaknesses. But what hasn't surprised me is the subject matter. I think I know as much about the subject matter and have as firmly held positions and capacity to understand how the system works as anybody who's been president, at least in, you know, the last 50 years. But what has surprised me is that I'm not as surprised as I thought I might be. I don't know if that makes any sense. But, you know -- [Begin Video Edit]  It's like sitting -- you know, when I was vice president, the big, big difference is that famous expression of Harry Truman, ""The buck stops here."" For eight years, I had a great relationship, and still do, with Barack. [Begin Video Edit] And he'd ask me -- [End Video Edit]  And I'd always be the last person in the room. And I'd say, you know, ""Throw the pass or run the ball."" And I'd give my opinion. I was the last guy. And I -- I'd get to leave. But he's all by himself to have to make that decision. That's the big difference. Most of the time, yes. As a practical matter, yeah, she is. [Not Broadcast] But -- she has -- we -- we have a lot -- there's a lot more ground to cover right now. So she's doin' an incredible job. But she is -- she's on the West Coast right now. She's all over the place. Sure. Yeah -- the answer's yes. Look, Major was a rescue pup. Major did not bite someone and penetrate the skin.  [Begin Video Edit] What happens is for -- I guess what surprised me is the White House itself, living there. Every door you turn to, there's a guy there in a black jacket. And so you're walkin' and we got -- [End Video Edit] and -- the dog's being trained now -- our trainer at home in Delaware -- and he was going home. I didn't banish him to home. Jill was gonna be away for four days. I was gonna be away for two, so we took him home. [Begin Video Edit] And, you know, we have a dogsitter there -- a friend who takes him. [End Video Edit] And -- but you turn a corner and there's -- there's two people I don't know at all. And, you know, and they move -- and he moves to protect. But he is -- he's a sweet dog. 85 percent of the people there love him. He just -- all he does is lick them and wag his tail. [Begin Video Edit] But he does -- you know, it -- I realize some people, understandably, are afraid of dogs to begin with. And -- I just think that -- anyway, we're -- in the process of having a training session. [End Video Edit] I'm gonna see him tonight, yeah. Thank you, George. I appreciate it. "
Joe Biden,"Of course, I do. There's a lot to write about. But that doesn't quite do it. It helps. But I have -- I really enjoy shopping for Jill for gifts. But -- Very good. But I can't tell her. It's a surprise. Pretty much gets it right. Listen to that. Jesus, yeah. Oh, man. Everybody knows I love her more than she loves me. I don't know what finally -- I think I know what finally won her over. But when I, in the accident, lost my first family -- part of my first family, my first wife, I was put on that 10 most eligible bachelors list. And some of the things that came across [inaudible] were like I had to give to the FBI, you know, any route. The bottom line was I had just given up on going out with anyone. And my brother set us up on a blind date, my youngest brother. And when I went out with her the first time, I knew this was the woman. I really did. I do. Only twice in my life have I ever fallen in love. And both times were -- I knew immediately. I'm not joking. I know that sounds bizarre, but I once asked her. I said, ""How can you"" -- when she finally agreed to marry me, ""How can you marry me knowing how much I love my first wife?"" She said, ""Because you love that deeply, you can love that way again."" I'll never forget it. And that made me realize -- and by the way, you know how we finally got it right? It was my boys. Our boys -- were young, and they came in and said, ""Dad"" -- and Hunt turned to Beau and said, ""Beau, you tell him."" ""Oh, no, you tell him, Hunt."" I said, ""What's the matter, guys?"" Beau finally said, ""Dad, we're talking. We think we should marry Jill."" Swear to God. They were six and seven. But I had to ask her five times. As the fifth time, I was in South Africa trying to see Nelson Mandela. We returned -- anyway, long story. I came home. He was still in prison at that point. And I came back and off the plane in Philadelphia, drove straight to her apartment, knocked on the door and said, ""Oh, Joe, come on in."" I said, ""No."" Said, ""You got my Irish up."" I said, ""I'm asking you one more time."" And I said, ""You don't have to say when. But if, if you say no, I understand. And that's it."" And I looked at her, I said, ""Will you marry me?"" She goes, ""OK."" Swear to God. So, I -- later, after it was all over, I called my sister. I said, ""What made her change her mind?"" They were friends. She said, ""She told me she fell in love with the boys."" They fell in love with her, too, and I'm not joking. And it's not a joke. They decided we should marry Jill. It wasn't ""You should marry,"" ""We should marry Jill."" And we got married at the U.N. Chapel. And in the chapel when we're sitting there, I said, ""Who takes us?"" And both of the boys got up and walked in the altar spontaneously. Swear to God. No, but it wasn't planned. It was spontaneous. They both got up and walked in, and we both were surprised and pleased. And we spent our honeymoon night together, all four of us. We went to see the play ""Annie."" She's also my best friend. For real. You can tell her anything. She's got a backbone like a ramrod. She does. You don't want to mess with me with this woman and -- Well, she's got both of them. I'm usually the brunt of her humor, though. And the boys love her making fun of me. I am the -- That's right. Yeah. Oh, God. I'd prefer it was not always about me, though. Right. Especially in the business we're in. You and me. You and us. Well, you know, I think of all the people, all the heroes. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. People say, ""Well, you went through a lot, the losses you've had, etc."" But I was lucky. I had family. I got Jill. I got her sister. No, for real. For real. But think of all the heroes get up every morning. Every morning put one foot in front of the other and keep moving and keep moving. They have nobody. The staff -- doesn't anymore -- they used to kid me because I find myself stopping to talk to people who, you can just tell, are down. And I say, ""Come on, you're hurt."" But it's not -- I mean, I think of the people who -- when things were really down for me when I got the news, how they just -- the little things, the little tiny things, just reaching out. I mean, literally just saying, ""Hi, how are you?"" And -- I'll tell you a real quick story. One of the things my dad -- when he was up in Philadelphia, he was in his late 70s, he was still working full time. I went up to see him, I was a US senator, and I was -- I had to be in Philly and we're going to go to a restaurant to lunch. And I had two of my staff with me, were heading to lunch, who knew my dad well. And a guy walked across the street and said, ""Hey, buddy, can you spare a dime,"" in effect, to ask for help. And I don't know why I said it, because I had a friend who used to joke and I said, ""I'm working this side of the street."" My father stopped dead. The only thing my father never once raised his hand. And it was with a devastating thing he said to me twice in my life, ""You disappoint me."" And he turned around. My dad did make money, took out his wallet. He had 40 bucks cash in it, and he hands it to the guy. And I said, ""Dad, I'm sorry."" He said, ""I can't believe it. I can't believe what you did. I can't believe it."" I said, ""But, Daddy, he's going to go by."" And he looked at me. He said, ""Do you think he'd be doing -- if he had any other choice, he'd be doing something like it?"" That was my dad. That's the only time in my whole life I did that. I don't know why I did it. [Inaudible] Reach out. Just reach out. Let people know you care about them. I mean, bring them -- literally bring them to your table. I mean -- I mean, it just -- it makes a world of difference. Well, actually, I don't think it's in the house. It's on the house, the Truman balcony, I think. Outside, it looks over the -- yo! Wine. Probably something with avocado in it. Oh, french fries. But I think you consider wine a snack, too. She used to want to go out. I think she'd rather stay in these days. So many. I don't know what the hell was in there. I think I think one of the habits would be to not talk to everybody I see. Oh! I -- I've been told that my whole life. My whole life. Oh, that's easy. Me. I said it first. I said it first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th. Giving me more credit than I deserve, but thank you for saying that. I don't want to go."
Joe Biden,"How are you doing? It's been a while, man. How are you doing? I'm doing well. I'm doing well. Well, you know, people are really hurting, and -- and they were hurting a lot when we started this campaign. As you know, you know, we -- we inherited a -- a hell of a mess. Unemployment was sky-high. We cut it to more than half. Black unemployment was sky-high. We've cut it down to one of the lowest rates it's ever been. You know, the fundamental thing I've tried to do is change the whole dynamic how we look at the economy. And that is I want to build this economy. And I really mean it. You know me well to know it. And I want to build it from the bottom up and the middle out because when the middle class is doing well and the poor have a shot, they have a ladder up, and the -- and the wealthy do fine -- because I'm not worried about them. And -- but the other piece of this is I think it is -- part of it is just changing the whole attitude. I want to completely, thoroughly, and not a joke, integrate the Black community into everything that's going on. I have appointed more African American judges. I put the first Black Supreme Court justice on the court. I have -- my staff has significantly more African Americans than most administrations. You know -- and I want to make sure that we provide for -- some funding for first-time homebuyers -- With a small businesses, so they could have a shot. And -- and in addition to all that, you know, we're trying to -- like, for example, we dealt with the child care tax credit before the Republicans knocked it out. It was -- it reduced child poverty in America by 40 percent. I mean, it was a gigantic help to people. Well, what it means is that you have an awful lot of people that are trying to stop people from being able to vote, make it incredibly difficult to be able to vote, cutting the number of polling places available, particularly -- We do. Yeah. And, by the way, that's what -- that's what I'm talking about. And you talk about, you know, you have -- you have over 300 people, D.L., who are running for office on the Republican ticket who deny that we won the election. They -- they deny that the last election was legitimate, number one. Number two, you have these same people arguing that they're not sure they're going to accept the results unless they win. And, you know -- and then you had that -- that -- that storming of the Capitol on January the 6th, and they're calling these guys patriots. And how the hell can you say we have a -- you're -- you're a democrat with a small D, or you're someone who really cares about the nation when you say, ""The only elections that matter are the ones we win. If we lost, it was cheated."" And secondly, that -- the guys and women who -- who broke through those doors and two cops ended up dying, and that these guys are patriots? Right. Guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns. That's what -- what's really up is murder and -- and injury from guns. Look, the idea, the idea that these Republicans are fighting with -- and standing with the NRA and saying we should allow assault weapons on the street, the idea that you can sell a damn -- have a -- go in and buy a cartridge that holds up to 100 rounds of bullets in it, the idea that you're able to do this with impunity and be able to purchase it is just outrageous. It makes no sense at all. You may remember, when I passed the -- the assault weapons ban in the '90s when I was a senator, violent crime dropped and then mass shootings dropped precipitously. And -- and then, you know, the Republicans wouldn't keep it. The other thing is we have to spend a lot more time with youth and dealing with the things that have to do with helping them through their circumstances. You know, for example, crime prevention programs in communities, there's a lot of really good ones. Crime actually comes down. You have to embrace -- and when you let -- when someone serves their time in jail and they get out, they shouldn't be further penalized. They should be able to get Pell Grants to go to school. They should be able to live in public housing. They should be able to have -- take access to everything that's out there. You give them 25 bucks and a bus ticket, they end up under the same bridge they're under before. I know. I know more -- I mean, I might know as much about this as you do, old buddy. And let me tell you -- [Inaudible] my whole life. And if the MAGA Republicans, these right-wing Republicans -- this is not your father's Republican Party. This is -- this isn't Governor Rockefeller. This isn't -- this is a different breed of cat. And they care about your community about as much as -- well, anyway. You've seen what you've got from that community. And -- and it matters. All the time -- every time I'm walking on my grandpa Finnegan's house up in Scranton, which is a working-class neighborhood, he'd say, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother, ""No, Joey, spread it. Spread the faith."" All right. Bye-bye."
Joe Biden,"Hey, Ricky. How you doing, man? Glad to be on your show. Thank you. And by the way, Tuskegee University's good, but it ain't Delaware State, you know. I just want you to know. I'm prejudiced about Delaware State. They got me off the ground way back when I was starting. Anyway -- Well, I hope I've improved the lives of African Americans like I said I would do. For example, too many African Americans were denied everything from Pell Grants, student loans, housing, etc. because they were arrested for possession of marijuana, many -- too many, all whites as well. So, anybody who was ever arrested just for the possession of marijuana, their record is expunged. They're not in the list more, and it's going to free up a lot of opportunities. I've also made sure that we are going to provide for student debt relief. You have 70 percent of African Americans receive Pell Grants. And what I've done, I've forgiven loans of $10,000 for every eligible borrower, an additional $10,000 if you had a Pell -- a Pell Grant. And -- and, you know, those historic resources of support, I've also put in $6 billion for HBCUs for a simple reason. You know, the -- the students at Black universities are extremely qualified, qualified as anybody at any other university, but because they don't have great endowments, they don't have these significant laboratories that teach every -- the technical things that need -- they need to be taught. And so, this allows these universities to build these facilities so that, now, you graduate and you have the same training as you went to -- you went to Harvard or you went to, you know, any other state university. And in addition to that, I kept my commitment. And I'm really excited about the fact we had the first Black Supreme Court justice -- Ketanji Brown Jackson. And she is really something else. You're going to be really pleased with her. I've appointed more female Black Americans to the -- to the courts, to the federal bench than -- I can believe every other president combined. And so, look, there's a lot -- and, by the way, you know, we now have a national holiday because I made sure that we're going to deal with what we said we were going to deal with. But the things that I think make the biggest difference, Rickey, that people haven't noticed -- I mean, it's not obvious -- is, for example, on COVID vaccinations -- I made sure that we went exactly where the Black community is, so they weren't left behind. So, the number of -- percentage of African Americans receiving their COVID shots is as high, in some cases, higher than all other Americans because I didn't want them being left behind. We went to their communities to make sure that the docs were available to give them what they needed. And so, you know, there's -- with police, we restricted [Inaudible] chokeholds and signed executive orders and no-knock warrants, but I still support funding the police. But we should be funding the police, particularly in Black communities where you have -- where you have more social workers. We have more people doing the kinds of things that are -- are that -- that are -- equipped the law enforcement to deal with things other than by pure force. And we have to hold cops accountable. But -- but -- but we need police officers. I'm not a defund-the-cops guy, but I'm fund them and give them assistance that they need. Retrain them as to how they, in fact, are trained. That's all -- I provided the money to do that. So, there's a lot going on. And I feel really, quite frankly, good that, you know -- And we're replacing every lead pipe in America, ensuring everyone across this whole country has good drinking water. And I'm sure that South Carolina -- anyway. And -- so -- so, there's a lot going on. I'm probably talking too much. I'm sorry. Well, I think they are excited. I think -- I don't know for certain, and these polls are hard to read. But a lot of early voting. The estimates are there's a lot more Democrats early voting than Republicans. I hope that's true. And by the way, you know, I'm on -- I want this to be a celebration like -- like Juneteenth, you know. I want this to be a big day. And one of the things you have to do is understand what the Republicans are going to do if they win. They're going to cut back on everything we've done. If you have a mom or dad on Medicare and they have diabetes, well, I've lowered the cost of -- put a cap of $35 a month rather than $450 a month for them to be able to get their -- their -- their insulin. So, they don't have to share it with anybody. They can have it. I'm going to make sure that there's insurance coverage for African -- we've reduced unemployment in the Black community from 16 percent or thereabouts down to 5.8 percent. We got more to do, but we're -- look, I -- and I've made a commitment. And you know I made it because you've followed it -- that we're going to have my administration look like -- look like America. So, we have more African Americans in senior positions, from the head of the Defense Department on. You know, and by the way, I remember, I know you're a fraternity guy. Well, you know, The Divine Nine. Well, for the first time ever, The Divine Nine met back last year in -- and on October last year with -- for the first time, the vice president of the United States, who was part of The Divine Nine, I might add. And it's a matter of making sure that every Black organization and the Black community is treated as fairly as possible and has economic opportunity because we still have a circumvent. If a developer builds a development -- housing development on one side of a highway, major highway and is occupied by a majority of Black and on the other side of the highway, it's occupied by a majority of whites, the same exact house will sell for somewhere between 15 percent and 20 percent less -- In the Black community than it will in the white. And we've got to change that. We're going to provide -- we're allowing -- we're providing start-up funding for new businesses, for, you know, small business administration. I'm just excited about what more we can do as well. You know, I mean, we've got to hold police accountable but fund them. We've got to make sure that African Americans have the same chance that anybody else does. And -- and that's not happening until we've gotten off with a big change. [Inaudible] around, Rickey. I'm here before you. But, by the way, vote, vote, vote, vote. It's important. Democracy is literally at stake here. I mean, it genuinely -- Is at stake here. The HBCU homecoming season across the country is going on now. No better way to honor the legacy of HBCUs than by voting, voting, voting. Thank you. Appreciate you, Rickey."
Joe Biden,"Great to be with you, thank you. Yeah. It's my hope and expectation, if we're able to put together and make up for all the lost time fighting COVID that's occurred -- that we'll be able to watch the Super Bowl -- with a full stadium. The Super Bowl is just one of those great American celebrations. And all those house parties, all those things that aren't happening. But God willing -- we're gonna be -- be able to celebrate it all as usual a year from now. Oh, I'm sure there are. I know it's hard. It was hard at Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's. But, you know, I hope people, if you're watchin', be careful. Be careful. Yup. That's -- No, we can't. That's why -- one of the disappointments was -- when we came to office, is the circumstance relating to how the administration was handling COVID was even more dire than we thought. The Trump administration. We thought they had indicated there was a lot more vaccine available, and didn't turn out to be the case. So that's why we've ramped up every way we can. I got a call through Commissioner Goodell saying we could have all 32 NFL stadiums available for mass vaccinations. We are -- Absolutely -- we will. And, I mean, let me put it this way -- I'm gonna tell my team they're available and I believe we'll use them. Look, it was one thing if we had enough vaccine, which we didn't. So we're pushing as hard as we can to get more vaccine manufactured. Yes. I think, because we've already done it. But the idea that this can be done and we can get to herd immunity much before the end of next -- this summer, is -- is very difficult. And then the other thing I'm very concerned about, and we've talked about this before, is making sure that the most damaged and hurt neighborhoods and people -- Hispanics, people of color, African-Americans, et cetera, they're dying at much higher rates, they're getting the COVID at much higher rates than white Americans, and there is also an understandable inhibition on the parts of some of those communities to not trust the government. One of the good things is, the vaccine's tested here in the United States -- Sure. I know. There really is. It is a national emergency. It genuinely is a national emergency, and women are dropping out of the workforce because they either have to stay home with their children, or if they had a job, go to work, and what do they do? Child care is extremely expensive. That's why one of the things in the proposal I put together provides for child care as well. I think it's time for schools to reopen safely. Safely. Teachers want to go back. My wife's a teacher. They want to go back to school, but what they are initially told, and what the science seem to dictate is: you have to have fewer people in the classroom. You have to have ventilation systems that have been reworked. You have to have more school buses because not as many kids can get on one school bus. You've got to have sanitation and, in the, everything from the dining room to the lavatories. Our CDC commissioner is gonna be coming out with science-based judgment, within, I think as early as Wednesday as to lay out what the minimum requirements are. I made a commitment that we try to get K-8 back to school by the end of this 100 days. Yup. They are, and I have. I've met with the teachers unions. They want to go back to school. They need some guidance. It really is. I think about the price, so many of my grandkids and your kids are going to pay for not having had the chance to finish whatever it was. That graduation where you didn't get to walk across the stage. I think -- they're going through a lot, these kids. Yes. No. Exactly right. I'm prepared to negotiate on that. But here's the deal: middle class folks need help. But you don't need to get any help to someone making 300,000 bucks or $250,000. So it's somewhere between an individual making up to $75,000 and phasing out, and a couple making up to $150,000 and then phasing out. But again, I'm wide open on what that is. Well, apparently, that's not going to occur because of the rules of the United States Senate -- My guess is it will not be in it. But I do think that we should have a minimum wage, stand by itself, $15 an hour and work your way up to the fifte -- it doesn't have to be boom. And all the economics show, if you do that, the whole economy rises. I am prepared, as president of the United States on a separate negotiation on minimum wage, to work my way up – from -- what it is now, which is pain -- look, no one should work 40 hours a week and live below the poverty wage. And if you're making less than $15 an hour, you're living below the poverty wage. No. I put it in, but I don't think it's going to survive. Look, I ran like hell to defeat him because I thought he was unfit to be president. I've watched what everybody else watched, what happened when that -- that crew invaded the United States Congress. But -- I'm not in the Senate now. I'll let the Senate make that decision. I think not. Because of his erratic behavior unrelated to the insurrection. Yeah, I have. And I believe it. I'd rather not speculate out loud. I just think that there is no need for him to have that -- the intelligence briefings. What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something? Well, we haven't had an occasion to -- to talk to him yet. There's no reason not to call him. I probably spent more time with Xi Jinping, I'm told, than any world leader has because I had 24, 25 hours of private meetings with him when I was vice president. Traveled 17,000 miles with him. I know him pretty well. A lot to talk about. A whole lot to talk about. Ans as I've said to him in the past. And – he's very bright. He's very tough. He doesn't have – and I don't mean it as a criticism, just the reality, he doesn't have a democratic, small D, bone in his body. But he is, um, the question is, I've said to him all along, that – we need not have a -- a conflict. But there's going to be extreme competition. And – I'm not going to do it the way that -- he knows this -- and that's because he's sending signals as well, that I'm not going to do it the way Trump did. We're going to focus on international rules of the road. No. [Nods his head ""Yes""] He has. So proud. I have. I've only gotten halfway through it. I'm so damn proud of him. He has enormous talent. He's a brilliant young man. I'll bet you there's not a family you know that didn't have somebody in the family who had a drug problem, or an alcohol problem, and he's gone through hell. I didn't even know it was being written until about a month and a half ago, and knew nothing about it 'til about five days ago. He thinks it's a way to help other people. I mean, this is a guy who when he's three years old, was pinned in the car with his dead sister and dead mother, his brother. But the honesty with which he stepped forward and talked about the problem and the hope that -- it gave me hope reading it. I mean it was like my boy's back. you know what I mean. He's -- anyway, I'm -- I'm sorry to get so personal. Um, you know when I felt different? When I walked through the front doors of the White House, um, after being sworn in. Yeah. Yeah. You know, President Clinton and I used to talk about how, who -- who's read the most biographies of presidents. He's probably read more than I, but I've read a lot of them, and I've always thought about presidents in terms of Abraham Lincoln up there, or, you know, Franklin Roosevelt or George Washington, and I thought to myself: how in God's name could I -- co -- can I, you know, do --compare myself to them? But then, I realized, I know eight presidents. I've served eight term. I know them. They're all really fine men, and you know their strengths and their weaknesses and it -- and it gave a little more of, well, you know, no I -- don't get me wrong, I think it's an incredibly challenging job, and I'm extremely flattered to have a chance to do it, and I hope to God I live up to it, but it seemed to make it more life size. I had wild dreams. It wasn't to be president. I thought I could be a flanker back in the NFL. Obviously, Brady's a great quarterback. Mahomes seems like he's got a lot of potential, and so, I'd probably take a shot with the young guy I didn't expect as much from. Well, I didn't say that. I -- I don't know who's gonna win. I think they're both great quarterbacks. One is just a younger version, potentially, of an old, great quarterback. Not old. In NFL terms, old. [Laughs] Well, thanks for having me. I appreciate it."
Joe Biden,"Well, it's hard to say whether they're wrong. Here's -- the science is saying now that masks work, masks make a difference, and there's a relationship. I think there's only one governor drawing back immediately, and most of them are somewhere in February -- I mean, the end of February, March, April, they're set a time limit. And I assume it has something to do with whether the omicron variant continues to dive fewer and fewer cases and because there is a relationship between the number of cases you have in your community and the need for wear masks. Oh, I do. Omicron and the variants -- all the variants have had a profound impact on the psyche of the American people. I mean, they have -- they've had a profound impact. For example, think of all the kids who didn't get to go to a prom, all those graduations that didn't occur, all the things that -- I mean, it's had a real psychological impact. Well, look, when I got into the office, only 46% of the schools were open. Now, 98% of them are open, and they're wearing masks. What's happening is every day that goes by, children are more protected. We're now on -- on the verge of being able to have shots for children under the age of seven and young children. And -- and so, the more protection they have, probably you're going to see less and less requirement to have the masks. Well, look, I think it's one thing to say -- to talk about masks other than to talk about shots and boosters and the like. And -- but it's -- you know, look, it is confusing. It's worrisome to people. They're trying to figure out. But what I've tried to do, I've tried to make sure we have all the vaccines needed, all the boosters needed, all the masks we needed, all the protection that's needed. Well, you know, it's -- I've -- I committed that I would follow the science, the science as put forward by the CDC and the -- and the -- and the federal people. And I think it's probably premature, but it's -- you know, it's -- it's a tough call. Well, look, I've spoken with Putin. I've spoken with every NATO leader. I brought them together like, I think, they've never been as coordinated in modern history, NATO leaders, about what to do if Putin moves. The question is he knows -- he has to know that if he does, the entire circumstance for Russia changes worldwide, changes overnight. The cost to Russia, both in terms of reputational cost and economic cost, would be profound. There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russians start shooting at one another. We're in a very different world than we've ever been in. No. How do you do that? How do you even find them? This is not like -- I'm hoping that if, in fact, he's foolish enough to go in, he's smart enough not to, in fact, do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens. Yes. Well, I -- I didn't have to tell him that. He -- I've -- I've spoken about that. He knows that. And, you know, it's a little bit -- look, that's what -- what I've asked is American citizens should leave, should leave now. We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. This is a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly. No. No, that's not what I was told. No, what I was told -- no one told me that -- look, there was no good time to get out. But if we had not gotten out, they acknowledged that we would have had to put a hell of a lot more troops back in. It wasn't just 2,000, 4,000. We would have to significantly increase the number of troops. And we're back in this -- this war of attrition. And -- and -- and there was no way we were ever going to unite Ukraine. I mean, it's going to be -- or Iraq -- Afghanistan. No way that was going to happen. And so, this is a much wiser thing to do. Yes, I am. I'm rejecting them. Well, you're being a wise guy with me a little bit, and I understand that's your job. But look, at the time, what happened was the -- let's look at the reason for the inflations. The reason for the inflation is the supply chains were cut off, meaning that the products, for example, automobiles, the lack of computer chips to be able to build those automobiles so they could function. They need those computer chips. They were not available. So, what happens? The number of cars were reduced, the new cars reduced. It made up, at one point, one-third the cost of inflation because the price of automobiles were up. So, what I did when I went out, I made sure we started to make those domestically. We got Intel to come in and provide $20 billion to build a new facility. A number of organizations are doing the same kinds of things. According to Nobel laureates, 14 of them that contacted me, and a number of corporate leaders, it's ought to be able to start to taper off as we go through this year. In the meantime, I'm going to do everything in my power to deal with the big points that are -- are impacting most people in their homes. Well, I don't think anything has changed, it's that people are now realizing what is in Build Back Better. You know, for example, there's cancer drugs that we have here in the United States that cost 14 bucks -- $14,000 a month. In France, the same exact manufacturer, the same exact drug cost $7,000. Yes. Yeah, I think it was. No, I -- I think I haven't sold it well. I like the way you phrase things. I haven't sold it well, but the point is we've moved the economy more than it's ever been moved. Well, I don't think anything has changed, it's that people are now realizing what is in Build Back Better. You know, for example, there's cancer drugs that we have here in the United States that cost 14 bucks -- $14,000 a month. In France, the same exact manufacturer, the same exact drug cost $7,000. Yes. Yeah, I think it was. No, I -- I think I haven't sold it well. I like the way you phrase things. I haven't sold it well, but the point is we've moved the economy more than it's ever been moved. Well, first of all, the shortlist are nominees who are incredibly well qualified and documented. Well, what I've done is I've taken about four people and done the deep dive on them, meaning this thorough background checks, and see if there's anything in the background that would make them not qualified. Well, I -- I think whomever I think will get a vote from the Republican side for the following reason. I'm not looking to make an ideological choice. I'm looking for someone to replace Judge Breyer with the same kind of capacity Judge Breyer have, with an open mind, who understands the Constitution, interprets it in a way that is consistent with the mainstream interpretation of the Constitution. Well, look, I love how people talk about personal freedom. If you're exercising personal freedom -- freedom, put someone else in jeopardy, their health in jeopardy, I don't consider that being very -- dealing with freedom. It's about moving in a direction you know is likely to diminish the prospects that this virus continues to spread. And so, I -- I think people should get the shots. We know the shots work. We know they work for the kind -- for the -- the variants that are available or that we are dealing with now. We know we have so many more tools at our disposal to prevent death and prevent serious illness. And I -- I just think they should be careful. And if they're not careful for themselves, at least think of their children, think of their, you know, their families. Well, I think it should be held to a reasonable standard. And, you know, the commissioner pointed out, they haven't lived up to what they committed to and lived up to being open about hiring more minorities to run teams. And whether or not -- you know, Goodell says they're going to take a look at what -- whether they can meet the standard. And the standard was set by, you know, someone who said this is something we should do. Think about it. It's -- I think it's -- the whole idea that a league that is made up of so many athletes of color, as well as so diverse, that there's not enough African American qualified coaches to ""to manage"" these NFL teams, it just seems to me that it's a standard that -- that they want to live up to. I don't know. It's not a requirement of law, but it is a requirement, I think, of some just generic decency. Well, my teams are out. And I -- I love this young quarterback from Cincinnati. He's an Ohio boy, can make everybody happy. But we also have some -- you know, I think Los Angeles is going to be hard to beat. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"Good to see you, Al. It was great. We went up to Camp David, and we had a -- we were with the whole family. It's getting bigger and bigger, grandkids, kids. We had Easter egg roll. And no, we did not roll. It's a hunt. I get up at 7 o'clock in the morning and go out and hide -- in total, I guess, I think, we hide 38 eggs. And some of them have little plastic ones. They put a little prizes in the eggs. And everybody -- everybody gets engaged. [Inaudible] Oh, it is. No, it is. And 30,000 kids coming through. Thirty thousand [Inaudible] It's a lot of kids. Lot of kids. Reach out to somebody. Do something nice. Just a simple act of kindness. I mean, it's not complicated. And it's amazing what happens. Open the door for someone. You know, pick up something if they dropped it. Move and say hello. I mean, I -- I really mean it. I just think we're -- we've gotten much too tense as a nation. I just think we have to be a little more open. Well, I plan on at least three or four more Easter egg rolls. May -- maybe -- maybe five. Maybe six. What the hell? I don't know. Well, I'll -- I'll either be the rolling egg or, you know, being the -- you know, the guy who's pushing them out. No, no, no. I'm -- I'm planning on running out, but we're not prepared to announce it yet. Good to -- to be here. I noticed all your cameramen want to put down their cameras and go get some of those Easter eggs."
Joe Biden,"It's surreal... but it's comfortable. We were here for eight years, just not in this part of the residence. Spent a lot of time in the Cabinet Room and the Oval with the President. So upstairs is new. We used to have two sets of bunk beds at home. They outgrew them. Although we now have one little 10-month-old. Two of our grandchildren live only a half mile from our home in Delaware, so they'd come over, sit outside on the lawn, and we'd talk to them from the porch and eat ice cream. I was bribing them with my Häagen-Dazs. [Laughs] This was maybe one of the most consequential Inaugurations in a long, long time -- not because I was being sworn in, but in the sense of what the state of the nation is, between everything from COVID to unemployment to racial inequality. We wanted to make sure that as many Americans could participate as possible, and it turns out millions of people watched it. We have such an incredible opportunity as a country now. Not because of me but because the American people sort of had the blinders ripped off, and they realized that, man, we have problems, but we also have enormous opportunities. For me, it was being sworn in, looking at the Chief and seeing Jill hold the Bible, our son and daughter standing there, and I could see behind them my grandchildren. It just made me feel so proud that we were all part of history here -- For us, family is the beginning, middle and end. And Jill's going to warn me not to say this because I sometimes get emotional, but it meant so much that Beau was there -- our son Beau, who was an incredible man. He was there in his namesake, his nephew Beau-y. It just seemed -- And I can't dance very well. [Laughs] No place that I would have rather been than with the kids. From the time each of these children were born, their grandfather had been either a United States senator or a Vice President, their dad had been the attorney general or abroad as a major in the United States military. And they had to learn to be happy and grieve in public. There is no private time for them. So when we got in the White House, I remember opening the door and walking through, and it was like, ""Okay, it's us. It's us."" I don't know that they ever want to run for office, but I can say this as a grandpa: They're so damn informed. Our oldest grandchild, Naomi, named after my deceased daughter, she is a lawyer now. Graduated from Columbia Law School. My No. 2, Finnegan Biden, I call her my secret weapon. This kid is more informed, I promise you, than the vast majority of people that I engage with. As is our No. 3, Maisy. She's in college. It's kind of like if you were raised in a family where your mom was the president of a bank, you'd know about mortgages. With them, we've never separated them from what we've done. So they've met everybody that comes in our orbit, and they have a sense of obligation, like our daughter. She's a social worker, and she's saving the world. She has a backbone like a ramrod. Everybody says marriage is 50/50. Well, sometimes you have to be 70/30. Thank God that when I'm really down, she steps in, and when she's really down, I'm able to step in. We've been really supportive of one another. I've read all that data as well about families under pressure, and that's why I'm glad she kept her profession. It's really important that she's an educator, although she took off two years when we first got married because the boys were little. It's important that she has the things that she cares a great deal about, her independence. And yet we share each other's dreams. We each could do our jobs, but not as well as we do them. I don't think I would have stayed involved in public life. Jill came along at a really important point and put my family back together. She's the glue that held it together, and I knew that I wanted to marry her shortly after I met her. When I first became Vice President, it was Valentine's Day, and the night before, Jill got the maintenance people to bring a 16-ft. ladder to my office, and she took that kind of paint that kids use in school -- -- and in every pane -- there's like 20 panes in each of these four windows that are 15 ft. high -- she drew hearts and ""Joe loves Jill."" A reporter told me that day, ""Everybody says you and your wife have a great love affair,"" and I said I think so. It's not that we don't fight and argue sometimes. I'm just lucky. Oh God, don't get her going, please. [Laughs] For every single special occasion. I think it's important to -- and Jill does the same thing -- let each other know that no matter how much time has gone by, she comes down the steps, and my heart still goes a little boom boom boom boom. For real. She is romantic, but I'm the one that is the seeker all the time. She makes me work for it. She's a very independent woman who wants a very traditional man who comes in on a white horse who's going to make sure everything works out all right. I don't want to proselytize. My religion, for me, is a safe place. I never miss mass, because I can be alone. I mean, I'm with my family but just kind of absorbing the fundamental principle that you've got to treat everyone with dignity. Jill, when she wants me to get a real message, she tapes it on the mirror above the sink where I shave. And she put up a great quote from Kierkegaard saying, ""Faith sees best in the dark."" Other people may meditate. For me, prayer gives me hope, and it centers me. Sure she does. I made the same deal with her that Barack and I made: I wanted her available to participate in everything that I did; I wanted her to be the last person in the room on every important decision. We have lunch alone once a week -- that's the deal -- when we're both in-country, which we'll be for a while because of COVID. I see her all the time. The thing that surprises me is how much energy Jill gets from her students. The students she teaches, these are foreign students or people who weren't the people who graduated from high school, but they're remaking their lives. It's an inspiration. It's energy for Jill, but it's a lot of work. We're going to run this like the Obama-Biden Administration. No one in our family and extended family is going to be involved in any government undertaking or foreign policy. And nobody has an office in this place. They always have access to Pop and Nana, but nobody -- I remember years ago an accountant said, ""You know, you can charge part of the gas you use in the vehicle at your home."" And I said no. Here's how I look at it: The foul line is 15 ft. away from the basket. Never get me closer than 17 ft., because it really is a matter of the public trust. He was impeached by the House, and it has to move forward; otherwise it makes a mockery of the system. It's probably not likely to get 17 Republicans to change their view and convict on impeachment, but I think it's important that there be certain basic standards. I'm not looking for any retribution. My job is to try to heal the country and move us forward, because I think we have so many opportunities as a country. I hope we have fundamentally returned to normal as it relates to COVID -- and it's going to be hard, because they're predicting another 100,000-150,000 dead unless we take precautions, even with the vaccine. I hope we have really begun to make inroads on equity for all people... where they can have decent jobs and decent opportunities, and the economy is growing, and people are back to a degree of optimism about themselves and their families."
Joe Biden,"Thank you for wanting to speak to me. Yes. Well, several reasons. Number one, I committed two years ago that if I got elected president, I would name -- if I had an opportunity, I'd name the first African American woman to the Supreme Court because I think the court should look like the country. And I think it should reflect the country. And so -- and, by the way, our administration is the most diverse administration in American history. We, actually -- as was pointed out to me, if you look around, you can see, but there's more women in my administration than are men. The point is that I want to bring the country together. And -- number one. Number two, she's brilliant. She is absolutely brilliant. She -- she graduated magna cum laude from undergraduate school. She was -- at her law review in law school, she clerked for the Supreme Court. She's been -- she's been confirmed by the United States Senate for three different positions. And she has real character. I think character matters. I think it's -- and I think background and being able to understand perspectives from other -- about other people in the country matters as well. They tell me -- I don't know for a fact, they tell me I presided over more Supreme Court justices than anybody living because I used to be chairman of the formerly -- of the -- that too -- but chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And I voted on an awful lot of judges. But she's incredibly qualified, and she has a disposition that is one that is -- can put litigants at ease. And she -- for example, this is a woman who was a federal public defender on the Sentencing Commission. She was a judge. But she also has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police. So, I think she has real balance, real character, and I think she'll add a dimension to the court that is going to make it even better. I've been around a long time. Unfortunately, we become so politicized in this country that I wish it would be different. Lindsey used to be a close friend. I just wish they'd give a chance. There's no basis for that assertion. But it's what it is. Well, I think I put as much stock in Trump saying that Putin's a genius as I do when he called himself a stable genius. Nothing like this though. Look, you have two options: start a third World War, go to war with Russia physically; or two, make sure that a country that acts so contrary to international law ends up paying a price for having done it. And it's -- this is -- there's no sanction that is immediate. It's not like you can sanction someone and say, ""You're no longer are going to be able to be the president of -- of -- of Russia."" But I think these sanctions -- I know -- I know these sanctions are the broadest sanctions in history, and economic sanctions, and political sanctions. And my goal from the very beginning was to make sure that I kept all of NATO and the Europeans on the same page because the one thing I think that Putin thought he could do was split NATO, creating a great aperture for him to be able to walk through. And that hasn't happened if you notice. It's been complete unanimity. And -- and Russia will pay a -- a serious price for this short term and long term, particularly long term. And I -- I think it's -- it's not only in Europe, but -- and -- and on the -- in the Pacific, Japan and South Korea and Australia and -- I mean, so it's -- I think if the democracies of the world hold together, I think it -- it increases the prospect that we're going to have less chaos rather than more. Well, beyond that. Not only NATO is more unified. Look at what's going on in terms of Finland. Look at what's going on in terms of Sweden. Look at what's going on in terms of other countries. I mean, he's producing the exact opposite effect that he intended. And -- but -- but all I know is that we have to stay the course with the rest of our allies. And in the meantime, we're supplying defensive weaponry and economic assistance to Ukraine. And I think it's important that we stay the course. Well, you know -- you know, obviously, you've heard things I've said before because I -- I've said at the outset of my presidency that there is a genuine -- we're at an inflection point in world history. It occurs every three or four or five generations, fundamental change taking place in the world, and the combination of the fundamental change is taking place. For example, you're going to see more change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 years. And it's because of the nature of science and technology and movement, and a lot of the autocrats. And President Xi -- I have spent a lot of time with President Xi of China. He's one who believes that things are changing so rapidly. Democracies don't have time to reach consensus, so autocracies are going to be -- are going to rule. Well, two things. One, I think the biggest impact on the psychology the country has been COVID. Almost a million Americans have died of COVID. And -- and so I think it's hard for people to get their arms around the fact that we have the fastest growing economy in 40 years. Wages are actually up, not down. Unemployment is the lowest it's been, it's under -- under, you know, it's just incredibly low and it's around in the three-point range. We find ourselves in a position where it's hard to fully appreciate that when you wake up in the morning and wonder or not, whether or not your uncle, and mother, father, son, daughter who has COVID are going to be OK. And as Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, points out, I think one of the significant things we're going to find 10 years from now is a phenomenal negative psychological impact that COVID has had on the public psyche. And so, you have an awful lot of people who are notwithstanding the fact that -- that things have gotten so much better for them economically, that they are thinking, but how do you get up in the morning and feel happy? Happy that everything's all right, even though your job is better, even though you have more income, even though -- and then on top of that, because of COVID supply chains have been so interrupted that now you have inflation. And inflation is a -- for example, one third of all inflation a month ago was the price of automobiles, but why they get so high? They don't have those little computer chips, so, they don't -- you know, we invented them here in the United States, and we went to the Moon. We don't make them much anymore. We're starting to now. But what happens is when we're they're made in -- in parts of Southeast Asia and Taiwan and other places, and we don't get them to us quick enough and can't get there, everything slows up. The same way with, you know, you have from Ukraine to -- to Russia, you know, wheat and all those things, those products. The generic point is that I think that it's -- we're gaining control of that. We're going to get there, but it's really disquieting for people. But I can tell them that hope is on the way. We have more tools now to deal with COVID than we've ever, ever had. We have -- I've ordered millions of pills, over 20 million pills, that Pfizer come up with, even you haven't had a vaccination and you get COVID, you take the pill, you're not going to go to the hospital; and shots in arms; and the ability to have boosters. And so, I think we're going to see things changing. But it's difficult, especially for people who have to get up in the morning, sit down to breakfast, and sit across from an empty chair. Well, first of all, I -- I don't think in terms of legacy, I think in terms of the needs immediately. I ran for -- I ran for president, really and truly. And even my supporters were not critical but thought the reasons I -- I -- I laid out why I was running, maybe they weren't such a good idea. I said I was running for three reasons, from the very beginning: One, to restore the soul of America. This idea of decency, honor, treating people with respect. Literally. Literally treating people with respect. And second reason, rebuild the backbone of the country, which is the middle-class, working-class folks. This trickle-down theory of economic growth, excuse me, has left the -- left an awful lot of Americans out. And I've never seen a time when the middle class is doing well that the wealthy don't do very well and the poor have a way up. And so, that's why I focused on how to change the circumstances and opportunities for working-class and middle-class people. And the third reason was, which I got a lot of criticism for, is saying I had to unite the country. We can't be a divided country. We can't be sustained and do the things that have to be done if we remain divided based on ethnicity, based on politics, it can't work. And so, they're the three things -- I hope my legacy is that I was able to restore some decency and honor to the office. I was able to bring the middle class back to a place where they had real opportunity, given an even chance to succeed. And I was able to reconstruct our alliances, which had been frayed so badly internationally. And that I was able to bring people together, bring the politics of America together. And I think we're making slow progress on some of these things, but I think that we're moving. I hope my legacy is that I restored the soul of this country, I was able to give the middle class, and we were able to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. And that we're able to unify the country again. Thank you. You're good."
Joe Biden,"Well, welcome back to the White House. It's America. That's Mr. Khan, right? The truth of the matter is that I've never more optimistic in my entire life about -- No, I mean it, now. I tell you what. Look, if you think about it, the reason I had not -- given my words to -- I hadn't planned on running again. I had lost my son, Beau. It was a tough, tough time. And I wasn't going to run at all for real. And then, remember what happened in Charlottesville when those folks came out of the fields at night with torches and swastikas -- The white supremacist. And a young woman was killed. I spoke to her mom. Then, President Trump said, ""There are very fine people on both sides."" And I gave my word, that's what I said, ""I'm going to do this."" But I was worried about doing it because I knew how bitter it would be. And so, I got a phone call from my -- true story, from my eldest granddaughter, saying, ""Can we have a family meeting?"" You probably aren't aware, it's around here. We have a tradition in the Biden family. Any child can ask for a family meeting. That doesn't often happen, but you take it seriously. So, my grandchildren, my four granddaughters and grandson, Beau's children and Hunter's children, came down on a Saturday. And we sat and talked, and they said -- trying to convince and they said, ""We know you're thinking of running, pop, but you ought to do it. Daddy wants you to do it,"" talking about Beau and the -- and I said, ""Well, it's going to be pretty tough."" And they said, ""You got to do it."" And we decided to do it. And I did it for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of this country. That's not who we are. We're a decent, honorable country that cares. We really are. We still are. Second one is to, you know, begin to take care of the middle class because if the middle class does well, the poor have a real shot, and the wealthy do very well. And thirdly, to unite the country. And at the time, thought -- people thought, ""Well, maybe the first two, but you can never unite the country."" But look what we did. We got a lot done. No one thought I could ever pass the -- the infrastructure bill. No one thought I could ever do anything about making sure that we took care of people with disabilities and -- and drug prices and whole range of no one thought we could do anything on the environment. No one thought we could do anything about -- about same-sex marriage. I mean, we did -- we did -- not all of it, but a significant portion of it was done in a bipartisan way. Young people. Young people. The generation -- that generation between 18 and 35 now, they're the ones that created the space. They had enough of it. They had enough of it. And so, what I did was when I tried to figure out whether I could put something together, I met with them. We had rallies. We had -- I mean, they showed up in the 2020 election. They showed up in the 2022 election. And we passed the largest environmental plan in all of history, over $368 billion. We got it done. And what -- and what happened was Mother Nature let her wrath be seen over the last two years. For example, I have traveled on helicopter over more forest area burned to the ground than the entire state of Maryland. That's how much has burned to the ground. Floods, droughts, all the things, and so people can't deny it anymore. They can't deny the fact. And I've traveled the world. I've gone to all the cop meetings around the world, meaning the meetings on climate. If we don't keep the temperature from going above 1.5 degrees Celsius, raised, then we're in real trouble. That whole generation is damned. I mean, it's not hyperbole. Really, truly in trouble. And that's why the first meeting I had with the so-called, you know, G-7, the -- the largest economies in the world, democracies in the world, the first thing we talked about was they want to talk about what was my initiative on -- on energy, on dealing with moving toward -- for example, I called all the automakers and truck makers, and I asked them to come to the South Lawn the first year and to try to talk them into it, doing something more, going electric. And within five weeks, all of them agreed, they're going to go electric, 50% by 2030. And by 2050, all electric. And I think we can do it. Yes. Well, first of all, we're going to fashion anyone's ever gone. We're going to need fossil fuels for at least the next 10 years. It's not like tomorrow, we can turn it all off. Number one. And so, in addition to that, we -- things got really complicated when Putin put 185,000 forces into Ukraine -- And having a profound impact on their energy ability to be able to keep the heat on in the winter and keep things moving. And so, we're going to need fossil fuel. What we have to do is we have to -- I've -- I've said no more drilling off our ocean, I mean, the whole range. But it still has to be -- there has to be the ability to generate some energy. But we can get rid of coal much more rapidly. And -- and by the way, for example, I was up in Massachusetts on the largest coal-producing electric facilities in the nation. Well, guess what? We hooked it up to wind technology. And so, now, it's cheaper. We can do solar. We can do wind cheaper than we can do fossil fuels. So, it's a matter of transitioning. But it's not like you can cut everything off immediately. Sure. Well, look, I've been relative -- I'm going to be careful here. Relatively successful. In working across the aisle. There is a MAGA Republican portion of the party. It makes up about a third of the Republican Party. I've had more than half a dozen Republican senators I've known for years over the last two years come to me individually, and I promise I'd never mentioned their names. And I'll go to my grave, never mentioned -- No, I'm not going to tell -- I -- I mean, seriously, I've never broken my word -- and saying, ""Joe, I agree with you, but if I -- if I do anything publicly, they're going to primary in me, I'll lose."" The Republican Party is going through a significant transition, and we're going to see in the next two years how they end up, whether the MAGA Republicans control the party or we get back to conservative. Like, for example, a guy as tough as can be is the majority leader of the United States -- the minority in the United States Senate, McConnell. But he's straight. He's a traditional conservative. He's straight. What he says, he does. He probably doesn't even want me saying this, probably hurt his reputation. But there's a lot of people in the Republican Party who are traditional Republican, conservative Republicans that you can deal with. But, you know, these -- you know, the gentlewoman from the state of Georgia and the mountains up there and others, [inaudible] anyway. But no -- but it's -- it's a -- there's an existential question that the Republican Party is going to have to face, and it's going to determine what happens in the next couple of years. But my focus is just stay focused -- focused on the things that matter. We've got to deal with the climate. We've got to deal with civil liberties and voting rights. We've got to deal with issues relating to economic growth. Look, in -- in this period, I inherited -- I think it's fair to say, a gigantic mess, economically and politically. We've created 12 million new jobs since I've been president, more than any president created in four years. We've generated so much growth. We've -- we've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs with the bill that became a bipartisan bill with no one thought could happen, the -- the CHIPS and Science bill. We used to invest 2% of our GDP in research and development. That's why we are the nation we were. Well, guess what? We decided to start. We -- we ended up being No. 8 or 10 instead of No. 1. Well, now, we're doing it again through the CHIPS and Science bill. Guess what? Commitments for $300 billion in investments over the next 10 years to build these CHIPS. We invented the CHIPS. We made them -- we made them much more sophisticated. We used to be anyway. So, there's so much going on that the country's hungry to move, I think, and I'm confident we can do it. Oh, there is. By the way, I mean, look, again, if I -- if we had -- had this conversation immediately after Trump lost, although he's not sure he did, but -- and I told you, we were going to get more done in two years than almost any president has done, period, and much of it in a bipartisan way, I think everybody would have looked at me like, ""What's this guy been drinking? What's going on here?"" But we have. We have. And I've been able -- we've been able to. The leadership of the Democratic Party has been able to hold a Democratic Congress together, and we picked up a few Republicans along the way. And I think it's beginning to bear fruit that it's hard to deny that it works. Well, first of all, the constitutional scholars I've spoken to say the people who challenged it should have no standing, meaning the court is ultimately -- as much as they want to rule, they're going to -- I think they're going to have to rule that it was appropriate for what I did, number one. Number two, if you think about it, we had this PPP program. That is the program during the pandemic. People lost their businesses because they had to shut down, the restaurants closed, and -- and so, we provided billions of dollars, significantly more than -- than helping students with their debt. And a number of the very people who criticized me in Congress actually got benefits in the program. You don't hear them talking about it, right? The average student, who will benefit from my student loan forgiveness program, is somebody making less than 70 -- 70 -- 90%, makes $70,000 or less. They're just trying to get out of the hole. They're just trying to get started. They're just trying to get up and running. And so, it is overwhelming in the interest of the economy. It's a fair thing to do. And it's going to generate economic growth that's significant. I understand them worrying. I understand. I don't know whether people realize, a lot of parents realize -- How much of a burden this is. You get out of school. There were no jobs when you graduated because -- initially because of the pandemic. You've got a debt that is, in most cases, exceeding $10,000 loan you got -- or grant you got. And -- and it's really a gigantic burden. You want to grow the economy. You want these people being able to go out and make a down payment on a home, make -- be able to go out and start a business, be able to go out and get -- be free to the debt so they can invest in things they care about. And it just is so shortsighted if they don't. I can remember exactly where my epiphany was. I hadn't thought much about it to tell you the truth. And I was a -- I was a senior in high school, and I wanted to get a job, being turned out the only -- it turned out I was the only Caucasian lifeguard in the projects in the city of Wilmington, the big swimming pools. And my dad was dropping me off to go in and get an application to city hall in Wilmington, Rodney Square, it's called. And I remember I'm about to get out of the car, and I looked to my right, and two well-dressed men in suits kissed each other. I mean, they gave each other a kiss. And then one went -- looked like he was heading to the DuPont building, and one looked like he's headed to the Hercules corporation building. And I'll never forget, I turned and looked at my dad. He said, ""Joey, it's simple. They love each other. It's simple. I'm not joking. It's simple. They love each other."" And it's never been -- it's -- it's never been -- it's just that simple. And I remember -- you may remember because you may have been here when I -- in the -- our last administration with Barack, I went on ""Meet the Press.""  And they asked me about their show. I was to tell them I had visited a family in another state, and -- and I watched these two -- this gay couple raising two kids and watching them run in and throw their arms around daddy and so on and so. And -- and I -- and I told them, I said -- they said, ""Well, what do you think?"" Russert asked me. And I said, ""I think people should be able to get married. Married. It doesn't matter whether it's -- whether it's same sex or heterosexual couple. You should be able to be married."" What is the problem? So, listen to your auntie and your uncle, and get married. Do it now. Don't wait. Now, transgender kids is a really harder thing. What's going on in Florida is what my mother would say close to sinful. I mean, it's just terrible what they're doing. It's not like, you know, a kid wakes up one morning and says, ""You know, I decided I want to become a man,"" or, ""I want to become a woman,"" or, ""I want to change."" I mean, what -- what are they thinking about here? They're human beings. They love. They have feelings. They have inclinations that are -- I mean, it just to me is -- I don't know. It's cruel. And the way we do it is we make sure we pass legislation like we passed on same-sex marriage. You mess with that, you're breaking the law, and you're going to be held accountable. No, no, no. No, no, but get moving, man. I don't want to hear you can't do it. Depending on how you edit this program, you. Well -- Thank you. Thank you. Again, welcome back. Welcome to a place you spent some time. I tell you what, I have it on all the time. It's kind of humbling walking in here. I mean, for real. I had my brother, Jimmy, come in and, you know, pick the rug and the desk and all that stuff. And make a long story short, and I come walking in like 5 o'clock on Inauguration Day. And I walked in and I said, ""Jeez,"" I said, ""I've never seen Franklin Roosevelt. I'm an admirer. But it's always George Washington's small portrait there. And Abraham Lincoln. And -- and Jon Meacham, the president's historian, Jimmy had called him for some help. And he looked and he said, ""Because no one's ever inherited a world economy in as much disarray as he had."" And I said, ""Oh, that's wonderful."" And then, I said, ""Well, why Lincoln?"" He said, ""The country has never been as divided since Lincoln was president."" But what I did was I wanted to be able to sit here in my desk and look out. And I only had two political heroes when I was getting involved, the fellow over there, Martin Luther King, and Bobby Kennedy. I -- I was a great admirer of John Kennedy, but I can never picture John Kennedy at my kitchen table. I could kind of picture maybe -- and then, the two people who I got involved -- engaged with is Cesar Chavez -- Because I got -- not involved, but I supported verbally the farm workers union. They were trying to organize in Delaware when I was running as a 29-year-old kid. And his granddaughter works for me. And then, Rosa Parks, who's over here. And so, I tried to -- I tried to make it kind of warm like -- I thought about, no, the other guy never showed up on Inauguration Day, so I didn't have to worry about it. But it's kind of neat. And the things I've done in here. Like, for example, I the moon rock over here. Are you really? Oh. Well, this is cool. That's an actual moon rock. And one of the -- you know, that rover they have up there -- My name is in the back with other presidents. It's really cool. But I want to show you something really cool. Come on back here. Not many people come back this way, but come on in. By the way. That is a Wyeth painting by Jamie Wyeth, the son. And he told me the Kennedy family didn't like it because it made them look too contemplative. But -- I know. I think it's great. But anyway, that's the house I was raised in at Scranton. Or as they say, Scranton. So, I went and spoke to the Kennedy Library a couple of times. The last time I spoke there, I get handed this by Caroline Kennedy. And it's that famous letter he wrote. And this is the actual copy. And it's -- you know, ""Why am I going? We chose to go to the moon in this decade because that goal will serve the origins of measure by the best of us."" And it goes on and on. Bingo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks."
Joe Biden,"Well, you know, Beau and Hunter and I talked about -- after I stopped being Vice President, about -- excuse me, before I became Vice President -- about, we're going to go to Ireland one day. And I always, I always wanted Beau to -- to be there. And we started off at the shrine down at Knock, at the Blessed Mother, and we're with the priest showing us around, and he said, by the way, the priest who gave the military chaplain, who gave your son last rites, which is the Catholic version of -- is, is here somewhere. And sure enough, about 15 minutes later, the priest shows up, who Hunter Biden had spent probably a number of days with, because he'd bring the priest in to talk to Beau, and he showed up, and he reminded us of talking to Beau, and how proud he was of Beau, and it just -- I know it sounds stupid, I should probably hesitate to say it, but I felt like Beau was with me, and it just felt like it completed the circle, too. I know that sounds stupid, maybe, but it just -- I felt like my sister, Valerie and my son Hunter -- we just felt like Beau is with us. There is, there is, because they're just they want to make sure this doesn't end up not being put together. Look, it's one -- the way to end up having a democracy that functions, it usually functions as a consequence of institutional structures, and when that occurs, you can generate economic income. And when there's economic growth, everything works better."
Joe Biden,"The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that brings us together. I look at the presidency as very big job and nobody will get it right every time. And I won't either, but I promise you this, I won't traffic in fear and division. I won't fan the flames of hate. I'll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our country, not use them for political gain. I'll do my job and I will take responsibility. I won't blame others. I promise you, this job is not about me. It's about you. It's about us to build a better future. That's what America does. We build the future. It may in fact be the most American thing to do. This is the United States of America. There's never been anything we've been unable to do when we set our mind to do it, and we've done it together. I'm doing well, thank you for doing this. Well, George Floyd's last words spoke to a nation, where the color of your skin dictates the safety and your future. And as long past time that these words have to be acted upon. Look, let me make something clear. I'm a white man. I think I understand, but I can't feel it. I mean, I feel it, but I don't know what it's like to be a black man walking down the street and be accosted. Being a black man, walking down the street, be arrested. Be a black man, walking down the street, and God forbid something worse happened to me. If we just let this wound scab over again, it's never going to heal. As I said, George Floyd's last words didn't die with him. They're echoing all across the country. And I think they speak onto to a nation where you have over 108,000 people who've lost their lives to a virus now. 40 million Americans have filed for -- over 40 million for unemployment. A disproportionate number of the coronavirus cases and job losses are on African American and Latino communities. Matter of fact, Latino community even have a higher unemployment rate, lost jobs. The moment, it seems to me, it's a wake up call for everybody, for all of us. And the moment I think has for our nation to deal with the systemic racism, to deal with the growing economic inequity in our nation. And to deal with the denial of the promise of this nation for so many. Early in the week, I laid out initial steps I thought that Congress should take immediately as it related to police conduct, outlaw choke hold, stop transfer weapons of war, meaning those Humvees and the rest, to dealing with armored vehicles to a police departments, improve oversight and accountability. Create a model use of force standard, because the country is crying out for leadership and the President of the United States must be part of the solution, not part of the problem. And it's my commitment to all of you as president, I'm going to lead on these issues and I'm going to listen. And let me just say, you asked why I'm optimistic still. I'm optimistic because one of the things I learned is that -- and you're not as old, but we're older, that I thought we had made enormous progress when we finally elected an African American president. I thought things had really changed. But what I didn't realize is what the historian says is that it's a constant pull and tug in America. America is not a fairy tale. The constitution is not a fairy tale. It's a constant struggle between good and evil as to who is going to prevail. And I believe in my heart of hearts that we can overcome and what if we stand together. And finally, as one America, we're going to rise stronger than we were before, but here's the deal. You can never -- I've gone on too long. I apologize. Let me just say this. One of the things that I think is important is that I thought you could defeat hate -- Excuse me. I thought you could defeat hate. That you could kill hate, but the point is you can't. Hate only hides. And if you breathe any oxygen into that heat, it comes alive again. And the words of a president matter. And when I saw those folks, I hadn't planned on running for president again, Don, for real, until I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, carrying those torches and chanting the same antisemitic vile they chanted in Nuremberg and in Berlin and in Germany in the thirties. And then a young woman was killed there, accompanied by white supremacists. And the president was asked, ""What do you think?"" And he said something no president has ever said. He said that, ""There were fine people on both sides."" The point is this is a constant struggle. We have to constantly fight it though. As Martin Luther King talked, that arch does bend toward justice, but you got to fight it. You got to fight it. It will never be defeated. And this is a case where I think as we move as one, and I think the American people are ready to move. Black, white, Latino, Asian. I think they're ready to move. We can, in fact, push it back. And if we stay vigilant. I really am hopeful, especially with the generation of young people we're going to hear from you today. Their generation is the most engaged, least prejudice, most open, most well-educated generation in history. So I'm hopeful. Hi, Nila. I say, I see you. I hear you. And I'm angry as well, but we have to turn our anguish into purpose and use this moment to finally drive real change to our laws and our institutions and our culture. As I said, history teaches us that out of some of our darkest moments, we've made our greatest progress. Reverend Barber said it I think best. He said, "" In the mourning,"" meaning when you mourn. ""We find hope. In the mourning, we find hope."" We need an era of action that reverses systemic racism and it's long overdue. And with concrete changes, I can't wait until I'm president to get started. Right now, though, we have to move. We have to urge Congress to take action now, no excuses, no more delays. Outlaw choke holds, stop transfers of weapons, I said, destruction to police departments. Improve oversight and accountability. Create a model use force standard. As I said, within the first 100 days, I'm going to create a national police oversight commission. And the vast majority of police are decent and honorable, black and white and Latino. And they in fact are worried about the culture as well. I've long believed that we need real community policing, meaning that they have to get to know, get out of their vehicles, know the people in the communities. We need to review our hiring practices, our training practice, our deescalation practices and hold bad cops accountable. Hold bad cops accountable. We need economic justice as well. You know that as well as I do. We have more to say this the coming days. But to start, Congress must fix the racial disparity in the COVID recovery funds. Right now, those funds aren't going to the right place. We need to pay essential workers, not just praise them. We have to pay them. And they tend to be minorities. We have to protect and expand Obamacare. He's trying to get rid of it in the moment we need healthcare so badly. There's so much work to do, not just in the presidency, but in my presidency, assuming I get elected, but in a generation. But I promise you I'm going to lead and I'm going to listen. And what are some of the things that we have to do? Well, there's many things, but I think -- Let me conclude your question by saying that your generation has gotten a real kick in the teeth. I have two granddaughters. I had one who just graduated from law school. I have another granddaughter who's a rising senior in Philly as well. And I have a second granddaughter's who's a rising sophomore and this whole 9/11 generation all the way through the Z generation and the early millennials. From the time you got started, you've been in a position where the people who graduated six years before you graduated in a gigantic recession. They had great opportunities, but what happened? They didn't have access to the jobs, the jobs weren't there, no matter what your color, but particularly if you were an African American. And then now what's happening with his COVID crisis, as well as the fact that we have this incredible unemployment rate, what's happening now? I know my granddaughter had a great job out of law school. They told her you can't come. You got to wait until March for things to start. I mean, no graduations. It's just put your generation in a place where there's reason to be concerned and angry well beyond, but including, dealing with systemic racism. And I think the country's ready because the blinders have been taken off and they've seen the people who've been carrying the rest of the country and their back have been what we now call essential workers, people in minority communities, people who are driving everything from disinfecting operating rooms to the nurses, to making sure the grocery stores are open. They're not only the people who are carrying us on their back, they're the people dying and people didn't know it before. They didn't know it before. So I think they're ready to deal with some of the systemic problems, starting with systemic racism. I really believe they're ready for us to move. I think we have a gigantic opportunity to create real opportunity in the next four years. The answer is I know Eric, he's a first rate -- He's on the [Inaudible] of my campaign, as a matter of fact. He's a first rate mayor and I think it makes sense. Some places, they're short on having enough people to cover the community or others the police departments have a lot more than they need. And so it depends on the community, but it's all about treating people with dignity, just treating people with dignity period. And sitting down -- People with dignity period and setting down basic fundamental rules that relate to what constitutes adequate and fair police conduct. That's what we have to focus on in my view. Good to see you, man. Because I love people, you and I -- I've been to your place twice for extended periods of time. What you didn't say is it's not only African-Americans, look at all the white leaders you've attracted. Look at all the people you've attracted to becoming part of a community, part of a larger community. I sat there, I don't know. I guess I was in your place, maybe a total of six, seven hours, total of two times everything. I watched, I went around to the tables. People were there, there were religious leaders, black and white using your place together. There were young entrepreneurs, black and white and Asian looking at your place to gather. It's about doing things together. The fact is that, look, I have never found it to be the case where my judgment about someone, whether I care about them has anything other than to do with their humanity. My dad used to have a saying for it. He said, ""Joey, everybody's entitled to be treated with dignity no matter what the circumstance."" I have no idea what it's like to be treated in a prejudice way as a black man. But I do know what it's like to be humiliated because when I was a kid, I used to stutter like that. I'm used to bullies. I'm used to people who take advantage of people. I'm used to people who in fact, just try to exert power for their own egotistical reasons. That's the part of me in my household, you could never, ever, ever, ever, ever say, you get in a fight with somebody. You could never say anything about them that was true. You couldn't say if they were 300 pounds, you couldn't say you're fat. You couldn't say you're skinny. You shouldn't say you're short. You could say if they are brilliant, you can say you're dumb, but you could never say anything that they had nothing to do with having to have put upon themselves. Well, yeah, yeah, you did but all kidding aside, Don, I mean, if we ever turned and said something, if somebody was homely and they did something really mean, and you said you're ugly, you'd be in real trouble in my house. For real. None of my kids, my grandkids, it's a tradition in our family because you know what it's like to be victimized. I'm not equating it to being a black man, but I'm equating realizing who it is you care about. Everybody. I really do believe, I mean, I don't want to proselytize, but I do believe we're all God's children for real. I really believe that. I believe we're all created equal. The problem is, are we all going to be treated equally? It's about being treated equally. The president of the United States must be part of the solution, not part of the problem. I'm not going to fan the flames of hate. I'm going to speak to heal racial differences. Look, I may conclude this by saying, because I want to get in a larger conversation with everybody conclude it by saying this. I think that if you think about it, the words of a president matter no matter who the president is. A president of United States can send a nation to war. It can bring peace. He can or she can make the market go up or down. He can also make people, he can encourage people to do bad things. What he or she says, how many of your friends do you know who have children who when the president comes on there, they pull them away from the TV? Not a joke. Think about it, think about it. It really matters. It really matters. Hate didn't begin with Donald Trump. It's not going to end with him. The history of our country is not a fairy tale. It doesn't guarantee a happy ending, but as I said, we're in a battle for the soul of this nation. That has been a constant push and pull for over 200 years. I call every American, ask themselves, ask them [Inaudible] okay, is this who we are what we're seeing now? Is this who we want to be? Is this what would pass onto our kids and our grandkids? I'll do my job and take responsibility, but I won't blame others. I'll never forget that job isn't about me. It's about you. Is that how we're teaching our kids? I work not only to rebuild this nation, but to build a better, stronger, more inclusive, more resilient than it really was. Look, if elected, my view is that you will have to, we'll have to address these issues straight on, and the words the president says matter. When a president stands up and divides people all the time, you're going to get the worst of us to come out, the worst in us all to come out. This president constantly talks about equality without lecturing, talks about and has administration that looks like the country and the rest. It changes attitudes. It's about the attitude of the country. Do we really think this as good as we can be as a nation? I don't think the vast majority of people think that. They're probably anywhere from 10 to 15% of the people out there that are just not very good people, but that's not who we are. The vast majority of people are decent. We have to appeal to that and we have to unite people, bring them together. Bring them together. Look, historic black colleges and universities have done so much with so little. That's why I proposed for over a year, I'm going to invest $70 billion in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions. I'm going to ease student debt crisis by that particularly impacts now on African-Americans. Historically, black colleges and universities play a vital role in their communities and the country. They educate more than their fair share of low income and first generation students. My state, Delaware State University graduates nearly half of our state's black college students. By the way, the president of Delaware State University used to work for me now. He was on my staff and I encouraged him to move on and he's now the president of Delaware State University. He and I spent a lot of time at Howard, as you may know at Howard University as well, they've done so much with so little but severely under resourced for much too long. Now, as president, I'm going to make sure HBCUs get the funds they deserve. Invest over $70 billion in research centers to tackle challenges from climate change to cancer, high-tech labs and facilities, internships, and other programs for graduate students. Look, one of the things that happens if you take a look at the state universities, the University of Michigan or whatever state university where an HBCU is, you take a look at them. The reason why they compete for billions of dollars in government contracts, and the government contracts to deal with with major issues that relate to the future and training the best high quality people in technology, savvy people in the world. What we did by the way in our administration, we took money that we went down for example, the deal with the whole issue of what we're going to do with what's going on in terms of the illegal eavesdropping by the Chinese and the Russians and others on the American system and how we're going to deal with it. We went down and provided money to set up laboratories and to graduate people out of HBCU near Roanoke, Virginia. What were we doing that for? They'll have an opportunity to have high paying jobs and they get out in the sciences. University of Delaware does a lot of work. They have millions of dollars in contracts dealing with metallurgy to get into develop high end and very lightweight steel. For example, metallurgy that relates to allowing aircraft carriers to have thinner decks, they can go faster, but still handle the plane. There's all kinds of medical research as well, but they need the laboratories and the infrastructure because you don't have the endowments for that. I'm going to cut the cost of education for everyone. I'm going to fight to make sure the student debt crisis, which disproportionately affects African-Americans, we're going to immediately forgive now, immediately forgive now, and Nancy Polosi put it in, $10,000 per person in any federal student loan. As president, I'm going to double Pell grants from six to $12,000. I'm going to have the cap on the student loan repayment. Instead of 5%, 10% of disposable income is 5% of your yearly income. I'm going to fix existing public service loan forgiveness programs, forgive $10,000 a year for five years for all those and all the remaining debt after after 10 years, if in fact you engage in public service. Forgive loans for any public college or private HBCU graduate making less, and a family making less than $125,000 a year. Forgiving loans, wipe them out completely. College degrees shouldn't be the only path though to the middle class. I'm going to invest in partnerships between high schools and community college. My wife use to be a professor at the community college for years and businesses, so the students can earn industry credentials before they graduate. I'm going to offer two-year community college debt free. Look, it's true, you can't -- I guess what I'm saying is that there's so much we can do to give the African-American community and HBCUs in particular, an opportunity to do what they do best. Look at all the confidence you got going to an HBCU, to going to Howard. Most of my friends who I grew up with in here in town in Delaware, were African-Americans, became very successful. First, their kids get into the Harvards and the Yales and the Penns of the world. They go to HBCUs and they go to the graduate schools that are the Ivy League or the prestigious graduate schools. It really has a way of not only looking out for, but dealing with and encouraging and keeping African-Americans in school. Last point I'll make is, my wife teaches at a predominantly minority classes in overwhelmingly, some are foreign students as well, at Northern Virginia Community College. Well, a lot of the students, you give free community colleges [Inaudible] and they still can't attend because they don't have the money to be able to pay for the food, the books, the board, I mean, if they have to drive there or stay there. That's why I'm going to double Pell grants from six to $12,000 to give real opportunity to people, genuine opportunity, but the HBCUs are the flagship, everybody forgets the reason they exist. They exist because you weren't able to go to any other schools because of prejudice, because of segregation. It's about time we set it right, give them the same foundation to build off of with laboratories and the like that every other major university has. By the way, Don, it was predicted just even before this crisis, that the economy was likely to slow overall because the graduates of the last 10 years and now, find themselves behind the eight ball, not having the jobs they thought they were going to have and losing time with student debt. Instead of being able to go make a down payment on the house, they got a $30,000 debt for going to a public university. I'm not talking about private universities, that's a different issue. That's a different issue. We got to figure out -- We need that help, that $10,000 help now across the board. What happens is 85% of our economy is driven by consumption, consumers, and if this generation doesn't have the money to buy houses, buy cars, take care of their major initiatives and bill, then we're not going to grow at the same rate. It's not only in the interest of the student with debt, like I graduated, I'm the first one in my family to go to college. It was a lot cheaper, but I was able to work and get through it and pay off the debt. My generic point is that you got to give people a shot. It's an interest of everybody, everybody that in fact, we have more students getting degrees in the areas that we need people to grow on, and everybody. -- and everybody. By the way congratulations, Alderman. I did the same thing, I became a council person, but it's the same kind of principle. But they know where you live, it's a hard job. Well, there's a number of things. Let me start off by saying again, congratulations to what you do. We have something in common. I was listed for all the years I was a Senator as the poorest man in the United States Congress. No, I'm not joking. When I did my financial disclosure as Vice President, one of the folks in the press said, ""It's probable no man has ever assumed the office of vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden."" I hope he wasn't talking about intellectual assets. So my generic point is that I got involved because of civil rights in the '60s and I'm a lifetime member of NAACP. They embraced me and the black church embraced me in my city and that's how I got started and they gave me confidence to think maybe I could do something. Maybe I could do something. And like I said, I'm the first United States Senator I ever knew, it wasn't like I -- the most impressive person I ever knew in terms of stature was the family doctor. I didn't know a banker, I didn't know a lawyer. We didn't grow up poor, but we grew up, I guess technically lower middle class. But my generic point is this: It gave me confidence. It gave me confidence that maybe I could change things and maybe change things a lot. I remember there's a film somebody did about me and it had a picture of me with my mother and my mother asking what I wanted to do when I grew up. I said, ""I just want to be somebody. I want to make a difference."" And it's like both of you guys on the screen right now, you want to make a difference. Let me just do something worthwhile. And so for too long the deck's been stacked against black Americans and today we're bearing the brunt of that, of our COVID and economic crisis in the black community and it presents, this crisis opportunity, to rebuild a stronger, a more inclusive and I think more resilient middle-class. If you live in a home built by the same builder my home is built in, your home is going to be undervalued, valued less than mine. Schools are underfunded, the poverty rate is still twice what it is for white Americans among black Americans. Black workers disproportionately have low wage jobs without benefits and seeing the worst layoffs to today, right now. Experts predicted a disproportionate number of minority owned businesses won't get any stimulus loans and the automation will displace African American/Latino workers at higher rates than it will white workers. So my plan for African Americans to close the wealth gap is to invest in African American home ownership. That includes my insisting that there will be a $15,000 first time home buyer tax credit for everyone. Which means that you know the bank will lend you the money because they know you're going to get that down payment because it's a tax credit, no matter what you make. Doubling the funding for the Obama/Biden state small business credit. For example, we set up a $1.5 trillion private window in small business drawing billions more, almost $30 billion of capital came in to sustain that $1.5. I'd double that to $3 billion a year. Support black workers in their fight for equal pay and labor rights and safe workplaces. Address maternal mortality that disproportionally impacts African American women, even African American women with means, with means, they're the last to be -- You go in the emergency room, you end up being the last one waited on. The last one taken care of. And so there's a lot of institutional changes we can make, but we have to provide the ability -- let me end it this way. The reason I ran for the county office, like you ran as an alderman, was to end red lining, end red lining. And so when Congress came along and the Democrats passed that $2 trillion proposal to stimulate the economy and the CARES Act, I said at the time what's going to happen is the banks are supposed to lend to small businesses, right? Well guess what? 40% of the money for small businesses never went there because the big banks don't -- and this is cost free to the big banks, okay? We bailed them out before, okay? They've been bailed out. They're supposed to lend the money. They weren't willing to lend money to small businesses because unless you had an account with them already, you had credit with them already or you had a credit card, that wasn't the way it's supposed to work. We have a mainstream business loan program that has billions of dollars in it. Not one penny has been loaned out yet. Not one. Not one penny, not one. We're in a situation where -- what the bottom line is, we've got to change and insist the way in which we deal with the African American and the Latino community is just fundamentally different. And the Asian Pacific Islander community, we have to make sure they have the same access. So if you want to do business in the community, you've got a loan in that community, you've got to be engaged in that community. We can set up legislation that does that. The House is trying to do that right now. So it's all about, ultimately, you being able to accumulate wealth. And how do most people accumulate wealth, to change their circumstance? In the housing they have, in the investment they have. And that's why I call for a multibillion dollar investment in housing. And because look at all of the places that African Americans and poor folks are being -- where neighbors are being gentrified, they can't afford the housing. They can't afford it at all. They can't afford to have a house in Los Angeles, San Francisco, suburban Chicago, parts of Philly. So we've got to change the housing voucher system we have as well. No one should have to pay more than 30% in terms of what their rent is. And on top of all that, we've got to change the institutional structures. I know this is going on long, so long, but there's so much we can do and I think we will do. For example, if you're a single mom working, or even if you're -- I was a single dad for a while, raising children, it's hard and I was making a good salary. I was a Senator, I was making $42, 000 a year after my wife and daughter got killed, raising two boys and I had help. I couldn't afford any childcare. I didn't have the money for it, couldn't do it. You should have childcare. We should be in a position where you are able to have family leave and get paid for family leave. A lot of things that can change the quality of life for people and put them in a position where they're not the ones that have to go out and do that $5 an hour job and leave their kids behind, et cetera. There's a lot we can do. And with your help, we're going to get it done. I really mean it, I'm confident the American people have finally -- the bandaid has been ripped off, they've seen the people doing all the work for us and a lot of them are saying, ""I didn't know that, I didn't know they had to do that."" Now's the time to strike while we have a chance. God love you. Absolutely positively you affect the quality of life of people in your districts more than the Senator does whomever he or she is. I mean, you really do. It matters. Well, first of all, I want to tell you about this young guy. He is a very talented fellow. My daughter is a social worker. My daughter ran the criminal justice reform operation here in Delaware. She has her master's in work and Keith wrote a really good book and she's so honored and so am I, he dedicated it to her, to Ashley Biden. And I want to thank you for doing that. You got it right. You figured out who the really smart Biden in the family is, it's Ashley. No, I really mean it. Thank you. Now look, Keith, here's the deal. The federal government can do a lot to affect policy at a local level, but it ultimately is affected at the local level. It's ultimately affected, I know you're running for the Senate and you know a couple of the folks who work with me as well are now sitting senators in the African American community. And I, as a federal official, cannot tell the state that it can or cannot do certain things. For example, of all the people behind bars in the United States of America, 93 out of 100 are behind a county prison bar or a state prison bar. And so what Barack and I did, we worked like hell to get 39,000 people out of federal prisons and what I'm proposing is we provide for incentives to get the states to reduce their prison populations. For example, no one should be going to jail for a drug abuse problem. They should be going into mandatory rehab. That's why I wrote the bill that required that there be drug courts. We don't need to build more prisons, we need to build more drug rehab facilities, mandatory rehab facilities. Because drug is a problem and it is a problem for the person who has the addiction. Two, we should make sure that anybody gets out of jail, we can't dictate this, we can do this for federal prisons, but I'm going to try to incentivize states to do it by giving them extra money. Anyone who in fact gets out of prison and is served their time, should automatically be eligible for every program that exists in the federal government. Right now, they can't get a Pell Grant to go to school, right now they can't get public housing. Right now they can't -- I could go down the list. They're denied every single thing. And you know, I've made these speeches in the Gold Bar with the big high paying business guys. I tell them it's it's in their interest, their interest that we pay money and our taxes, to see to it that someone can be rehabilitated. Right now all that happens is you get out of prison and you get $25 bucks and you -- You get 25 bucks and you get a bus ticket. You end up under the Third Street bridge. That's what happens. But if you're able to come out and qualify to go on get a student loan to go because you qualified to go for free to Del State or to community college or wherever you are able to get into, and you can get Pell grants at 12,000 grand a year, you can begin to build your life. And we also should be in a position where anyone convicted, for example, of a marijuana conviction, automatically that should be expunged so when you get asked a question, ""Have you ever been convicted?"" You can honestly say, ""No,"" because you have to put it down now on a job application, right? There's a whole range of things we could be doing. Why does it not make sense that since we know one thing that all criminals have, ""convicted"" people have in common that go to jail on balance, regardless of their race, is they're not very good readers. They don't have much of an education. And they tend to, if they're violent criminals, come from a family where they were physically abused or they saw their mother abused. Why does it not make sense to deal with those problems while they are in prison? Why not have drug rehab in prison if it's another crime for what you went, but you have a drug problem? That's not why you're there. Why does it not make sense? I think you may have helped Ashley try to get the provision passed, where she got the criminal justice outfit to buy a tire store. Train people in prison to know how to change and fix tires, retread tires, by the facility, the state by the facility, train them while they are there so they have a job waiting for them when they get out. Why don't we do that? We're spending money the wrong way. We shouldn't be building any more prisons. And that's why I opposed the provision in the bill that I had passed that provided more money for state prisons, no more federal prisons, state prisons. We should end all mandatory sentences. It makes no sense. And so there's a lot of things we can do and we can do it now. But I know you know this because I know your activity. I know your interest. And keep it going. Keep it going because I'd tell you. No, I really mean it. You can change things. You can genuinely change things. The truth is we can't afford to wait. The country needs solutions now and the problems exist now. I urge the Congress to take these actions immediately and urge young guys like you get involved and start at a state level the same thing. It's the same thing. There's so much more to say, but I've already said too much. And can I ask you a question? What you most get asked about in the community now? I met you down at East Side at Bethel with Reverend Beaman. I've seen you before. You know, it's one of my old haunts but when you're together with people your age in a neighborhood, what are they talking about now? I mean, for real, practically, not generically, just what concerns the most? Did you see what happens when the system breaks down? This guy deliberately broke the system. He thinks government is bad Trump. The reason that doesn't work, he thinks it isn't designed to work. He doesn't know how to make it work. It's all about breaking it down. And it started with the Reagan era. Government is bad. Your problem is government. Well, let me tell you. Wealthy people don't need government to protect them, but poor folks, white, black, all colors, all backgrounds, they need the government to protect them, otherwise they get taken advantage of. It's just about power. The ultimate sin, my daddy say, the greatest sin of all is the abuse of power, abuse of power, whether it's economic power, political power, or physical power, it's the abuse of power. And that's why we need young men like you and young women on this call to be engaged in the politics of changing what's happening in the street. It really does matter. Now look, I don't want them to paint this all rosey. Let me conclude by saying, look, the act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason for the protest. The act of protesting should never be allowed to overshadow the reason for the protest in the first place. And what I worry about tomorrow night in Wilmington, for example, there was a lot of really good people. I'm not going to be here. I'm going to be up in Pennsylvania, but tomorrow night, and what I worry a little bit about, is you and many other are going to be out there protesting legitimately for change. But we can't allow the protesting to overshadow the purpose of the protest. So there's going to be a lot of folks who are going to want to cause trouble, some cops, but some folks too. And so it's going to take young leaders like you to begin to change things in the city again and get reengaged in the city. An awful lot of people, Don, did very well. The guys I grew up with, everyone from Lafayette, Jackson, Spencer, Henry, all these guys who I grew up with, where it became very successful what they did. But what's happened is that the last two mayors ago, African American mayors we've had, have called me and said, ""Joe, whenever there was a problem before, every major successful African American businessman would be in my office, see what can do to help."" Problem is you tell them they're not in the office anymore, a lot of them. They're not being brought back in because they've said, ""I've got other things they got to do."" But now you have young leaders like our current, like you and others that I met with, including dealing with not just the NAACP, with guys like been around a while like mouse, but also dealing with the new guys that are coming up and dealing with new organizations. And I feel something's changing here. It's starting to move again. And I think you're going to be part of that. As a friend of mine used to say, from your lips to God's ears. Well, Don, I do a lot of these meetings like this, and with your permission, I'll contact you and see if we can get you to do more of this. But we have these, we call them round table discussions, from everything from first responders to women in the community, to dealing with whatever the issues are, to have them tell me what their problems are. And sometimes with good reason, they're angry. They don't think that I've proposed enough to get things done and they may be right. But what I found is I learn from them. What I find is that there is an emerging new sense of the need to be engaged, to be involved, just to make things just a little bit better, and we can make it a lot better. Because I really do think, Don, I'll conclude by saying when I was coming up as a kid, I'm not making myself onto any great civil rights guy or big hero, but we'd desegregate movie theaters. And anyway, no, I was no big player. But I remember at a time in the early, when Bull Connor down in Birmingham, and you know a lot about this because you helped my buddy ion Alabama win, American people heard about how African Americans were treated and lynchings and all the things that were talked about back then, but people who lived in communities where there weren't any African Americans, they just didn't really believe that stuff happened. I mean, they thought it, but they didn't see it. And Bull Connor thought he was going to stake a wooden stake in the heart of the civil rights movement when he sigged those dogs on those African American women in their Sunday best going to church, ripping skin off them with the fire hoses, having dogs to go after the kids and the like. And what happened then? As Dr. King said, paraphrasing, it awakened the nation like, Oh my God, this really happens? This really happens? We ended up with the Civil Rights Act. We ended up with the Voting Rights Act. It was a change because people around the country aren't bad people, but they're not engaged said, ""I didn't, you know, I understand that."" But when they saw it, it radicalized them into saying we got to act and it worked. I think that what Donald Trump has done and what was happened in a eight minute, and I think it's 47 seconds, with a white cops knee on the neck of a guy smashed against the curb. I think it's like, ""Oh my God. Oh my God."" We see it in direct color. It's technicolor. They're looking at it, said, ""Oh my God, I can't breathe."" And the country now is having trouble breathing. They're angry. And I think they're ready to move. And we have to change the institutional structures, everything from police brutality, racism writ large, but also the things that make life better for people, access to healthcare, everybody, access to daycare, access to education, access, access, access to begin to rebuild a community and give people a shot. Anyway, I'm sorry, but I feel pretty passionate about it. And again, if I have the passion, I can only imagine how you feel. I can only imagine how you feel. You may remember. When they asked me to campaign down in Alabama. They said, ""What's we want Biden in Alabama for?"" Okay? Well guess what? We're going to win back the United States Senate. We have to win the United States Senate back. Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, places we hadn't been able to compete before. We're going to win back to the United States Senate. That's going to change the ability of the next president to be able to make real change. Yeah. Well thank you very much. And we'll do this again, team. I promise you. Guaranteed. Thank you. Social distance and wear your masks."
Joe Biden,"Happy to be with you. Thanks for having me. Well, they're going to hear about why it's so important that we have strong HBCUs across America. I was able to make sure we provided for eight -- or $5.8 billion in additional aid to HBCUs. Now one of the best HBCUs is Delaware State in Delaware, I got there. But I've also been to the HBCU, I'm going to be there on Friday. My good friend and one of our great leaders, Jim Clyburn, is receiving an award that day, and I've been asked to do the commencement speech and present him the award. And so, I'd almost walk to South Carolina to be able to do that for Jim. But -- so, I just -- we're going to be talking about what the opportunities are and why we have to do everything from making sure there's economic opportunity and also deal with voting rights, voting rights, voting rights. That's how I got involved in politics. And for years, I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I was able to, my last time as a senator, as chairman, to get it extended for 25 years, and even got Strom Thurmond to vote to extend to 25 years. In the meantime, a Supreme Court case came along and said, ""you don't need any more preclearance."" The states that were -- historically were prejudiced against allowing or preventing African Americans to vote had to be pre-cleared to make sure they didn't come up with any other games. Well, the John Lewis legislation that we're trying to pass would, in fact, change that, would say, ""no, no, you got to -- need to go back to preclearance, you have to do that."" And so, it's really important because you see what's happening in all over the country. They attempt to keep African Americans -- make it harder for them to vote, not easier to vote. Yes. Well, it was -- I just said was -- it didn't take long. I said yes because, first of all, he's one of the really great leaders in the country. I mean, for real. He's a man of enormous integrity, as was his wife, who, God rest her soul, was so deeply involved, and Jim has been a champion for all the things that matter, not just HBCUs and education, generally, but everything from making sure -- for example, Jim was the guy that enabled me to convince the -- to get legislation passed, saying that there is -- on the farm programs, how African American farmers have been left behind. Well, we've changed that. Now, they're -- we're making up for that. And there's just a lot of things that Jim has been so, so much a leader because he has a real conscience. He has great integrity and a conscience, and he is not hesitant to make his views known, which I like a lot, too. Well, they're not going to be. You're going to -- the problem is they're going to be available. This could cost you money or it's going to cost Santa some money. But all kidding aside, there are problems with the supply chain as it relates to food, relates to used cars, relates to oil. For example, I was able to release my authority, as president, 50 million barrels of oil from the oil reserve we call the SPR, we have, and convinced some other countries I've dealt with to release some of their oil as well to drive down the price of gasoline. For example, now it's below $3 a gallon in Columbia for the first time in a while. We're driving it down all over the country, and food prices, particularly our poultry and beef and pork are up because there's a concentration of producers of the outfits that, in fact, take the pork and the beef, etc., and turn it into the food that gets on the shelf. And there's a concentration that's -- to submit it, and it raises prices. For example, Tyson Foods made an extra over a billion dollars the last quarter when asked why they're able to raise prices because there are so few competitors. They are all the big guys. And so, I have legislation that I have an executive order I signed to go in and take a look at. They should hold hearings on whether or not the concentration essentially violation of antitrust. The concentration is too much raising the price artificially for people. In addition to that, there's a lot of other things that cause prices to go up having to do with COVID because we import an awful lot of things from around the world. For example, there are two ports -- seaports in California, in Southern California, where 40 percent of all the product that comes in the United States goes through those ports. Well, when you have people shutting down factories that have precursor materials for them in Southeast Asia, then the prices go up. And in addition to that, when the ports are only open for five days a week instead of seven days a week, 24 hours a day, you have these containers piling up on the docks and not getting to the market. So, I met with everyone from Walmart and all the big distributors, as well as FedEx, to make sure that we can get those products, those big container ships -- the containers off the ships, on the dock, and off the docks, into the stores, in the warehouses. And that's one of the other reasons why there's enough product now. We still have to do more, but there's significantly more product out there for people to be able to go out and buy their Christmas gifts. Well, you know, you hear a lot from my home state as well as yours and other states saying, ""Well, I have my freedom. I have a right to not get vaccinated."" I think of it in terms of patriotism. You're out there and you're not vaccinated. This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, of the unvaccinated. You have, in South Carolina, 55.5 percent of all the people fully vaccinated and nationwide 65 percent. But that those who aren't vaccinated are the ones that continue to spread the diseases. And so, we should think of it in a patriotic duty. Whether you're working in a supermarket to make sure you have been vaccinated so you're not spreading anything to anyone else or you're not likely to get the virus, whatever -- and delta still is the worst -- is the biggest problem. And you know, what's happening is we have, otherwise, the rest of the economy is beginning to really grow. Unemployment rate in your state in October was below four percent, 3.9 percent, nationally it's 4.2 percent, going down. Our gross domestic product is growing, etc. And so, the only thing that's going to stop us is vaccinations. And here's the deal, they're free, they're available, you can walk into your local drugstore and get them, you can move and your -- some churches are providing it, there's a whole range of areas where you can get a free vaccination. And if you haven't gotten your booster shot, if your last vaccination and fully vaccinated, quote, unquote and was six months ago, get your booster shot. It's overwhelming protection, overwhelming protection and so it just seems to me that if you have a -- and what we've been able to do, we now have vaccines for everyone, five years and older, five years old and older. And so, it's really a game changer, a game changer. And I don't understand why people are unwilling to, other than this, because it's almost become a political issue. Like, if you're a conservative Republican, you're not for it. That's not fair because a lot of Republicans do get vaccinated. But this idea that I'm not going to be told what to do. Well, you know, it seems to me that, you know, if you have any serious problem that is communicable, you should at least be tested before you walk into somebody else's home or you walk into the church or sit next to your -- in the pew on Sunday next to somebody. You should be cognizant of their health, their safety, their response, their health. And so, I just think that it's just not very responsible. It's not, you know, again, I get told, "" Biden, you're trying to take away my right"". Why don't you think about being patriotic? Patriotic, help the rest of the country because the people who are spreading the disease are basically unvaccinated. We got to take care of it. Well, it's going to mean a lot. For example, everything from, you know, a lot of your state does not have broadband and, you know, and a lot of moms and dads have had to be on -- be able to get the internet so their kid can do their homework. How many times you drive by a fast-food restaurant and see people sitting on the cars, not ordering food, but getting access to broadband, so their kid can -- this is the United States of America. Why in God's name do you have to go to a fast-food restaurant to be able to work off of their broadband? So, it provides broadband. It also is going to do something I'm fairly familiar with South Carolina, not unlike Delaware, a lot of shoreline. We have a lot of problems with lead pipes. We have a lot of problem with water that is contaminated. This is going to replace all those pipes. All the money's in there to make sure that you're going to able to replace all those pipes so you can be certain of the 400,000 schools out there where a kid turns on the faucet or goes to the water fountain, what he or she is drinking is pure water. They're not going to get sick. In addition to that, you have to, along your coastline, when you have the flooding that's occurred, you can't build back to what it was before if -- and so, let's say the flood comes in, and it is two feet above the road level and washes it out, you got to build three feet above because it's not going to get better. The environment's not going to get a lot better, but it can get a lot worse. So, you got to build back better. And then you have a lot of bridges that need repair in South Carolina. You have a whole lot of things that have to be done. And guess what? It's going to create millions of jobs nationwide, thousands of jobs in South Carolina. And these aren't jobs paying $7 an hour. These are jobs paying the prevailing wage, 40 bucks an hour or more, being -- with health care coverage. And it's to allow people to live a -- and my dad used to say, he is a high school graduate. And daddy said, ""Joey, all I'm looking for is a little bit of breathing room."" It's a little bit of breathing room. For example, you know, right now, if you're a mom or a dad, you have one of those hundreds of thousands of children who have type 1 diabetes, guess what? Your insulin for that child, not going into a coma or, God forbid, dying, costs somewhere around -- between $400 and $1,000 a month, depending on how much you need to take. Well, the proposal I have in the new legislation says nobody pays more than $35 for the monthly -- and by the way, it cost the drug companies $10 to make this. Nothing's changed since then. Why in God's name is costing all this money? And a lot of it has to do with allowing people to reclaim their dignity. I can't imagine being a dad or mom, knowing my kid needs this and have no -- I have no insurance and no way to afford it. It just -- not only is your child's health in jeopardy but you're stripped of your dignity. And we can do this without raising taxes on anybody making less than $400,000 a year. I don't know. It just frustrates me, as you can tell. I'm sorry. Go on, but -- Good. Look forward to meeting you. Well, look, I -- I'm in the -- I got involved in public life because of civil rights and civil liberties issues. And coming from a state that is a good state but has a lot of problems, I think that -- I'm not sure Joe Biden's visit is important, except to the extent that I think we got to come together. I don't think we can continue to be red and blue. I really mean it. I think, look, we're a purple nation. This is not about -- I mean, we're all Americans. And I think if we sort of -- and I know I got criticized heavily when I was running for the presidency and getting the nomination, even in South Carolina, which I did very well, and thanks to Jim and others. But the whole notion that I said I'm running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of the country, a sense of decency and honor, treat each other with respect. Don't talk to each other like we're talking to each other. Secondly, to build the backbone of this country back up, and that's the middle-class and working-class folks. You know, Wall Street -- I'm not anti-Wall Street, but Wall Street didn't build America. Hard-working middle-class people built America, and unions built the middle class. And thirdly, I said, which I really got clobbered by everybody for saying, but I still believe in, we have to unify the country. Democracies cannot function long unless you can reach a consensus. And compromise is not a dirty word. And so, we got to get back to that talking to one another, getting engaged like we did before. I just did -- Bob Dole in his deathbed asked me to do his eulogy. Bob Dole was our leading Republican. But guess what? We disagreed on a number of things, but we were friends. We didn't -- we treated each other with respect. We got to get back to that. Democracies are in jeopardy if we don't start working together. Thank you very much."
Joe Biden,"Good to be here, man. [Applause] I thought my wife came in. Well, she did. She just made the commencement speech at the Los Angeles Community College. By the way, I'm Jill Biden's husband. She's right there. [Applause] Good to be back, Jimmy. I mean, I thought maybe you want me to just stay on Fox all the time. Oh, everybody asks serious questions. [Inaudible] Not at all. Not at all. I never mind having a conversation with someone really smart. No, but I'm happy [Inaudible] Well, I think a lot of it's intimidation by the NRA. And look, this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a MAGA party. It's a very different -- a very different Republican Party. And -- and so, you find people who are worried, I believe, that if they vote for rational gun policy, they're going to be primaried, and they're going to -- they're going to lose in a hard-right Republican primary. Well, I think -- many of them do. You know, I get in trouble for saying this but I get on -- we have very different views on a lot of things, but I -- I've always had a straight relationship with -- with the majority -- with the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell. You know, he's a guy that when he says something, he means it. I disagree with a lot of what he says, but he means it. There are a number of -- That's right. Well, no. What he did -- I mean, look, he's a -- he's the leader of a party that's moved very hard right. And so, in order to get anything done, he has a different problem than he did early on before Trump became president. They haven't. They haven't. That's why they think -- Look, Jimmy, you may remember the last time we did something serious about guns was when I passed the assault weapons ban. I was the guy who sponsored that, got it passed, limiting the number of bullets that could be in the magazine, whole background checks, a whole range of things. And we passed. And violent crime and gun crime dropped off. But I can only get it passed for 10 years. It had to be reauthorized. And when the first Bush administration came along, they didn't reauthorize it. We didn't have the votes. And so, what happened was, all of a sudden, it came back on assault weapons again. And guess what? Crime went up significantly, three times. I mean -- so, there is a direct correlation between the kinds of weapons that can be had. Look, I -- I met with every single family member of all those kids who were killed and the teachers killed out in -- down in Uvalde, Texas. And they stayed with me for almost four hours, over 200 of them, meaning family and extended family. And the stories they told and the pain you could see on their faces, it just made you -- I mean, it just -- it leaves such a -- Well, the answer is -- [Applause] I think we should make the demand. Here's what has to happen. All of you folks -- and I hope -- and I'm not being facetious when I say this. Let's hope the Republicans are here as well. You got to make sure that this becomes a voting issue. It's got to be one of those issues where you decide your position on the issue, senator, or candidate for House or Senate, on what we're going to do on this with assault weapons and how -- have -- maybe they'll have 300 rounds in a magazine. And I mean, what you say on those is going to determine how I'm going to vote for you. It should be one of those issues. Well, we did last time, as I said, and -- and inspired in 2004. Sure. Well, I did. Well, I -- I -- I have issued the executive orders within the power of the presidency to be able to deal with these, everything having to do with guns, gun ownership, whether or not you have to have a waiting, but all the things are within my power. Well, I don't want to do, and I'm not being facetious, I don't want to emulate Trump's abuse of the Constitution and constitutional authority. [Applause] And -- and so -- and I -- I mean, as you said, that get -- often get asked, ""Look, the Republicans don't play it square. Why do you play square?"" Well -- well, guess what? If we do the same thing they do, our democracy would literally be in jeopardy. [Applause] I mean, I'm not a joke. Well, you got to send them to jail. [Applause] You know, there's that little box in there. Go directly to jail. And my granddaughter. And her fiance. Yes. It's my daughter's birthday. Happy birthday, baby. No, no, no. No, no, no. My dad used to have an expression, ""Families is the beginning, middle, and the end."" Well, on climate change, we've actually made some real moves. I mean, we have -- we have, you know, one in seven of all the changes that have taken place in terms of solar, wind, and -- and -- and wind pumps, I mean, pumps and like -- have occurred in the last 18 months. We've moved. And there's an opportunity with the process we have dealing with energy to be able to gradually move more rapidly than we have been to alternative. For example, electric vehicles. Jimmy, when I got elected, I'm, you know, I pushed electric vehicles for the last, I don't know, God knows how long. Well, I had -- I had a conversation with the chairman of the board of General Motors, Mary Barra, and -- and she -- she was suing California, remember? And for be -- the case, ""Your standard was too high,"" as she said. Well, guess what? We had a conversation. I got a call from her about three days, four days later, she dropped the suit and committed she's going to go all-electric in the entire General Motors line. And by 2035 -- by 2030 [Applause] going to [Inaudible] Well, it -- no, but it really is. And then Ford came along and did the same thing. So, we're on a path. And -- and what is the successor to Chrysler is doing the same thing. We're moving in directions that are being slow. Look, we won. I won by -- I got 81 million votes, more than anybody's ever gotten, and thank you for those who you helped. [Applause] But what's happened to me is, you know, we still only ended up with 50 senators, which means that we have 50 presidents. Well, here's the thing, it's interesting, you know, one of the things that's causing problems is that people think it's the Democratic Party that's so divided in their problem. The problem is we have 48 out of 50 senators vote with me 95 percent of the time, more than any president has gotten that kind of support from their -- from their constituency. But we only have 50, and you can't get even two, three, four Republicans to vote. Look what's happening now with regard to everything from the way they talk about this potential decision from the Supreme Court. I mean, it's going to be -- it's awful. Well, Well -- well, what I say to them is -- and by the way, they agree on a lot of these proposals relating to everything from -- from choice all the way to -- Well, yeah, I know. But it's not like they are -- they're 80 percent of the time. The pace that they're not there is Joe's not there on a lot of the things having to do with the climate and the environment because he comes from coal country and -- and he has a different view, and Krysten is not always there in terms of the tax policies. Look, here's where we are. We have the fastest-growing economy in the world, the world, the world. We have 8.6 million new jobs just since I got into office. Unemployment rate's down to 3.6 percent. We've reduced the deficit last year by $320 billion. This year, going to reduce it by $1.7 trillion, trillion dollars. And so, we're the strongest economy, and that's allowed us at least to stay on top of and a little bit ahead of what's happening around the world. Second thing is, look, inflation is the -- is the -- is the bane of our existence. Inflation is mostly in food and in gasoline -- At the pump. Well -- And you've -- you've got every -- Well, we -- we could. But here -- but -- but -- but here's the deal. You know, my dad used to say every -- every family needs a little bit of breathing room. If you take and look at all the costs that a family has on a monthly basis, it also includes health care, prescription drugs, child care, all those things. What I'm proposing, we get -- and I think we can get it done, I'm proposing that we, in fact, reduce the cost of those things. Why should -- anybody -- anybody in the audience know anybody who has to take insulin every month because they have -- Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes. Well, guess what? They're charging as high as a thousand bucks a month in some places, average $647 a month on average. Well, if I pass what I want to get done, which we can do, we can do it relatively easy, it's not going to cost more than $35 a month. It costs these companies -- [Applause] no, no, I'm not -- this is not, as our friends on Fox would say, socialism. This is very practical. They have it costs 10 bucks to make a vial. So, charging $35 gives them, you know, a significant profit. They don't need -- for example, our oil companies. Oil companies, instead, everybody says, ""Well, Biden won't let them drill."" They have -- they have 9,000 drilling sites that they've already owned that are there. They're not doing it. You know why? Because they make more money not drilling and buying back their own stock. No -- Well, it is screwed up -- But we are only a few votes away from being able to straighten it out. We have to get the message across in a way that is understandable to people like the folks in my family when we grew up. Tell people what the -- what -- just what the facts are. And the facts are that this isn't anything about -- so, this is about building the economy. When I ran, I said, I want to build a new economy. No more trickle down, from the bottom up and the middle out, because when the middle does well, everybody does well. The wealthy do very, very well. The idea, there are 54 major corporations in America, made $40 billion last year and don't pay a penny in taxes. Not a penny. How many you think the tax code is fair anywhere along the line here? No, I'm not being facetious now. I'm being deadly earnest. They don't pay a penny. I don't -- so, if we had a minimum tax of 15 percent just on this year demand [Ph] minimum 15, it doesn't hurt them at all. They make a lot of money still. And we could raise a lot of money to make sure that child care doesn't cost you 1,400 bucks a month. [Applause] Fox, right? Well, here's what I think. Look, think about this. Look what impact the pandemic has had on people. It has had enormous impact, negative impact. Think of just -- think of just your kids. How many got to go to a prom? How many had a graduation that got celebrated? How many of -- how much has changed in terms of relationships between people and how they interact with one another? I mean, so much has changed. And we need -- Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, talks about the need for significant mental health proposals relating to people who are feeling not knowing where they're going, not knowing how -- how to respond, not knowing how to act. And so, there's a lot we can do. But the bottom line is I think that we've seen such a radical shift in one party and ability of that party to -- the -- that minority of the -- the MAGA folks -- To control it. Yeah. And -- and so -- But I've never -- I've never been more optimistic in my life, so I'll tell you why. You know what -- No, it does. [Applause] Look at the kids. Look at the young people. Best educated, least prejudiced, most giving generation in American history. [Applause] Turn on the television there. [Applause] You turn it on -- no, I'm serious. No, but I'm serious. You turn on the TV, look at the ads. When was the last time you saw biracial couples on TV? When was the last time you saw the way -- I mean, people are selling products. They do ads to sell products, and they sell products when people -- they appeal to people. This generation is going to change everything. We just got to make sure we don't give up. There's an ability for us to do everything from -- increase the access to education, health care. Look at what we did in health care. All the talk about it. I was able to reduce people's bills, about 400 bucks a month. No -- So, there's a lot of major things we've done. But what we haven't done is we haven't been able to communicate it in a way that is -- let me say, another way. Well -- But look how the press has changed. Look how the press has changed. I know you get -- you overstand it. You don't just understand it. You overstand. But here's the deal. One of the things is that it's very difficult now to have a -- even -- with notable exceptions, even the really good reporters, they have to get the number clicks on the nightly news. So, instead of asking the question -- anyway, it just -- everything gets sensationalized in ways and -- but I'm convinced we can get through this. We have to get through it. And one of the things -- look -- I don't blame you. I -- I call Trump. [Applause] And -- I haven't, you know, he talks about, you know, sensitive documents and the like. I don't destroy anything. But one of the things that I spent more time with Xi Jinping than anybody, any other head of state, and I'd always be -- when I traveled with him 17,000 miles, spent 78 hours with him, they tell me, all told. And we'd have, either of us, a consecutive interpreter and he'd have one. And the difference between when I would do that and others would do it, I always handed in all my notes. Hand in my notes. Well -- No, it's a -- I think if there's -- if the court overrules Roe v. Wade and does what it's -- Drafted -- Well, if that occurs, I think we have to legislate it. We have to make sure we pass legislation making it a law that is the federal government says this is how it works. [Applause] And it's just going to be the beginning, by the way. You know, there used to be a case called Connecticut v. Griswold. Well -- You know -- no, but all kidding aside -- Yeah, it is. [Applause] But Connecticut v. Griswold said that you could not use contraception in the privacy of your own bedroom. Because in the Constitution, there was no right to privacy. And so, they could outlaw and if you use contraception, it was against the law. You couldn't purchase contraception. And, you know, there's a whole range of things that are at stake here when we talk about eliminating Roe v. Wade and all it's -- all of -- I mean, it's just ridiculous in my view. And I don't think the country will stand for it. But I think what we're going to have to do is there's some executive orders I could employ. I -- we believe we're looking at that right now. [Applause] But I want to keep -- Hey, look. It's clear that if, in fact, the decision comes down the way it does and these states impose the limitations they're talking about, it's going to cause a mini-revolution. They're going to hold a lot of these folks out of office. We got to keep it focused on if some -- if you -- if they overrule Roe v. Wade and the state of California won't do it, but other states say that you cannot do the following. It's a law, you can't cross the border, you can't -- all the things that some states have. And you got to make sure that you vote. You got to vote, and let people know exactly what the devil you think. [Applause] If you think -- But we have made some progress there. There was -- Five hundred sixty thousand, but it's moving. It's moving. My mother used to say out of every -- any bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it. So, the reduction on the use of oil also increases the need to find alternatives. And I'm -- that's why I'm going over to the -- called G-7, the seven largest economies in the world, and meeting in Germany in a couple of weeks. We can do this. This is the United States of America. [Applause] We can do it. I really mean it. I mean it."
Joe Biden,"Happy to be with you. Well, look, I'm not going to opine on what he should do, but I think the committee handled it very well. They've been straight forward and to the point, and it seems to me it would make sense, but I'm not going to get -- because if I get in that, then they're going to end this well am I influencing the committee and the rest. So I've been very, very circumspective on anything I've been saying. Well a portion of them they'd say that's great, and to a larger portion I think they'd say that was a mistake. Well I think we should be concerned. Look, there's nothing automatic about democracy. Remember, when you're in undergraduate school they talk about every generation has to protect democracy. Well, it really does. And I think we're at one of those inflection points in history where we've reached a point where there has been such a division that you have what I'd call the -- the ""mega MAGA"" Republicans who are -- think that it's all right to threaten violence, think it's -- that's an appropriate talk about how they are concerned about security, but yet you saw what happened on January 6th, the whole world saw it. And -- but I think there's reason for concern. But I'm optimistic about two things, Jonathan. Number one, we've been here before. And I -- I believe that the essence of who we are as a nation, the soul of country, is really about our commitment to the basic fundamental elements that make us Americans, which is the idea of fairness, decency, honesty. And I think it's baked in to a majority of the American people. And I think as long as we take seriously the threat, I don't think the threat can come to fruition. [Crosstalk] I think -- well, I think they do. I think under threat and a concern on other issues meld. In other words, you know, when you say it's under threat, they worry about basic rights being taken away. They worry about the idea that you can have a -- people in public life talk about one another in the way they do with such bitterness. Look, you know, the organizing -- we're unique in all of them -- all of history. We're the most unique nation in the world. And I'm not being -- I'm not trying to beat our chest about who we are as Americans. We're the only nation that is not built on ethnicity, geography, whatever. It's on a notion that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. And it's the core of all of this, I think, is that concern. It's a concern that -- that, you know, the soul is sort of the breath and the essence of who we are. And it ultimately gets down to not supporting violence, not supporting -- making sure that you have -- you count the votes when they're cast, not intimidating anyone who is at the polls, not intimidating anyone who wants to vote. And I still think that's a rock bottom core issue in America. Well, I think there are a number of things that happened. Number one, I think that we -- we began to -- we had a leader who concluded that -- that the truth didn't matter a whole lot, and used the modern version of the old racist kind of baiting that we used to -- that used to be the case, you know, 40, 50 years ago in parts of the country. And -- and I think it -- it just -- I don't think enough people took it seriously to begin with. And for me, what changed things for me was I hadn't planned on running again. And I think you know this. If I'm taking too much time, stop me. But and when I saw those folks down in Charlottesville coming onto the fields, carrying Nazi swastikas, torches, singing the same antisemitic bile that was sung at the time in -- in the '30s in Germany, and accompanied by the white supremacists, a young woman got killed. And they ask -- and I talked to her mom. And when she got killed and the president was asked, what did you think? He said there were fine people on both sides. No president has even said anything like that. And it's a reflection of this notion that whatever it takes to have power is appropriate, and I just -- I just find it disturbing, and I believe, though, that in 2020, for example, more people to showed up to vote than any time in American history. I think they're going to do it again. Many conservative Republicans. Well look, I think that if we allow the Republican Party to continue to metastasize into what it -- a minority of the party as a whole is, look, I think one of the reasons there's not more mainstream conservative Republicans running out there is because they're so concerned about not only their physical well-being but also the notion that how can they win when a minority of Republicans are showing up to vote and they're really hard edge. Look, I don't agree with anything that Liz Cheney believes about the substantive issues, but I admire the hell out of her. She means what she says. She doesn't support the notion of use of violence. She doesn't support the notion -- she insists that there are basic fundamental rules. And it used to be that way all through the Senate. I mean, hell, I served with Jim Eastland and Strom Thurmond. You know, I served with really conservative members in the United States Senate. But afterwards, after we'd argue like hell, we go down to the Senate Dining and everybody would eat together. There was still an understanding that the differences maybe profound, but they don't justify the kind of activities you're seeing today. Well look, I can understand somebody having that view who's uninformed and believe it because it cost so much money to help them. We're spending a lot of money helping the Ukrainians, but it's so much more than the Ukrainians. It's about NATO. It's about Western Europe. It's about making sure that -- that Putin is not able to succeed in the way that he is using the brutality of his activities. And I think that -- I just think it's about, again, this notion of power. And either lack of ignorant -- I mean, lack of knowledge or power. One of the two is the driving force, maybe both, but I don't know. Look, Jonathan, I think that this is not a referendum. This is a choice, a choice between what kind of country you want, between, for example, do you let -- do you make sure that we're able to afford prescription drugs for people that are elderly? Do we have a circumstance where we're able to negotiate -- Medicare's able to negotiate drug prices? Do we -- are we in a position where -- and you go down the list of all the issues that are out there, and we know that -- look, the Republicans have made it clear. First thing they want to do is they -- a lot of them -- most of them voted against the bill to reconstruct America through the infrastructure bill, highways, roads. They all voted against -- to a person, voted against the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides for environmental security and safety. And I mean, I just don't -- they don't have a platform other than tear down what I've been able to do -- we've been able to do. And I don't know what they're for. Well, first of all -- [Crosstalk] I'm not sure about the polls because, you know, the way people conduct polls today, it's hard -- 90 percent of it is you get on a telephone where you have to call seven times to get somebody to answer the phone, number one. Number two, a lot of what we've done and we've passed has not kicked in yet. For example, we have all this money to rebuild highways, bridges, Internet, et cetera, but it's going to take time. It's not all happening overnight. It's not like we passed the law and, all of the sudden, highways and bridges are all functioning. It's not like we're in a position where we're saying, no senior -- which we do -- is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year for their drug costs, even though some are paying 13, 14, 15 with help of their families because of cancer drugs and the like. It hasn't kicked in yet. It doesn't kick in until next year. So a lot of what we've done, people are -- are hurting, they're hurting because when you take away that margin for people sitting around the kitchen table and they're paying three times as much or two times or one-and-a-half times as much for their gasoline, it matters. I grew up in a family where when that occurred, it was a discussion at home. And so, I think this is a process of people making sure that what we say we're doing really is going to happen. And so that's why these last several weeks, all I'm doing is saying, here's what we're for, here's what they're for, and make a choice and vote. And I think people are going to show up and vote like they did last time. Yes. Veto anything they do. They have to get -- for them to make Dobbs -- for them to outlaw Roe, outlaw the right of a woman to make a choice with their doctor; to not make exceptions for rape, and invest, and et cetera; and pass it out of the Congress to make it the law of the land, the president has to sign it. I'll veto it. It's not so much he'd say to those people. What he'd say to me in my view. The only reason to be involved in public life is can you make life better for other people. And depending on who the opponent is, if they have a view that is so antithesis of what I believe democracy and I believe is good for average Americans, then his argument was, Dad, you have an obligation to do something. The reason I'm not making a judgment about formally running or not running, once I make that judgment, a whole series of regulations kick in and I have to be -- I treat myself as a candidate from that moment on. I have not made that formal decision, but it's my intention -- my intention to run again. And we have time to make that decision. Dr. Biden thinks that -- my wife thinks that I -- that we're -- that we're doing something very important, and I shouldn't walk away from it. Thank you, Jonathan. Yup. Yeah. She's doing great. She is -- first of all, she's smart as hell. She has she has a backbone like a ramrod, and she has enormous integrity. And -- but if you take a look out there, there isn't any public figure that is, you know, with 60% favorable ratings. I mean, you know, most of the -- and -- but she is doing a great job. And she is -- and she is really, really thoroughly informed and, particularly on areas of foreign policy and national security issues. And so I find her to be extremely, extremely well qualified and a great asset. We have lunch once a week and -- and she is and -- she -- there's nothing that she is cut off from. We engage her in everything. And, but it's I think she's doing a great job. Yeah. Yeah. I got over 60% of youth vote last time. I didn't do that. And, but -- but here, look, here's what it is. It's not what's going to work. It's what's fair. The idea that someone would sit in a federal prison for the possession and use -- not a sale, not the sale to minors, not the trafficking, not just possession -- to sit in a federal prison makes no sense to me. None. And -- and, it just -- anyway, so I've been thinking about this for a long time and done a fair amount of research on whether or not just the mere use of marijuana. I'm not trying to legalizing -- Just the use of it -- is so detrimental. And the idea of putting someone in prison and what happens is, Jonathan, what happens is everything about their background gets put on hold. They can't borrow money, they can't buy a house. They can't -- I mean, because they have a record, they've been in a federal prison. It's not just to let them out of prison. Wipe the record clean. Wipe it clean. It is there's no rationale, in my view, for someone and thousands of young people being in a situation where they are put behind the eight ball the rest of life because they use marijuana. Well, I think Aunt Gloria should take a look -- I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about anyone's age, including mine. I think it's totally legitimate. But I think the best way to make the judgment is to -- to, you know, watch me. You know, am I slowing up? Am I -- I don't have the same pace, you know? And that old joke, you know, everybody talks about the, you know, the new 70s, 50s and all that stuff. You know, I -- you know, it could be -- I'm a great respecter of fate. I could get to disease. I could, you know, drop dead tomorrow. But I, you know, in terms of my energy level, in terms of how much I'm able to do, I think people should look and say, is he -- is he still have the same passion for what he's doing? And if they think I do and I can do it, then that's fine. If they don't, then they should vote against me -- not against me. They should encourage me not to go. But that's not how I feel. I can't even say the age I'm going to be. I can't get it out of my mouth. [Laughter[ I can't. I mean, I swear to God, it's like, No, I mean, I know that can't be true. And you think I'm joking? You know I'm not joking. It's just -- it's just strange. But I think Aunt Gloria should just take a real hard look, and if she concludes that I -- I'm missing a beat, then she should, you know, support some other Democrat if they decide to run. But, Jonathan, right now, knock on wood, don't want to jinx myself. You know, I'm in good health, all of my -- everything physically about me is still functioning well. [Laughter] So, you know, and mentally, too. So, you know, I -- I just -- but I understand people want to ask that question. There's only one reason, I think, to be in public life. I really mean it: can you make life better for other people? And there's no place that you have a better opportunity to do that as President of the United States. The difference between being president, being a senator, even a, quote, important senator, chairmen of committees and all of that, is that nothing gets to the president that hasn't been able on -- that hadn't got to him because it's been unable to be solved in the meantime. And so it's one of the things that is the difficult part of this. And I mean, I literally I get up, work out at 8:00 in the morning and I go to bed at 11:00 at night. I mean, they send me -- tell my staff to not put those big briefing books together for me when I walk out the door. But all kidding aside, it's -- there's just a whole lot out there. But I'm going to say something I probably should consider not saying. Is that -- I have more substantive experience on the issues facing the country, both in foreign policy, domestic policy, than any president ever, just because I've been around so long doing this. And so the bad part is I feel like I'm in a good position and make the right decisions. But some of the decisions are really -- are almost toss ups. They're hard. And I'm not saying I get everything right, but I -- but it's not the facts that are missing. It's the judgment about the other players. For example, I read -- I know every major world leader I've known almost every major world leader for the last 20 years because of my role. And, you know, as vice president, I did an awful lot of foreign policy for the president. It's -- a lot of it is, just -- it's the same in the Senate -- knowing and accurately assessing what the other guy's, woman is thinking and how to get to go, because I still think there's enormous possibility to reach compromise on important things. On important things. So you can't always get it your own way, but you can get a move in a long way. And I just, you know, right now, you know, who knows what happens? Look, you know my history. I -- I got elected to the Senate when I was 29. I thought at the top of the world and six weeks later and my wife and daughter were killed. My two boys almost died because they got struck by a tractor trailer. I'm a great respecter for fate, of fate. And so -- but right now I feel completely capable of doing the job as well as anybody could do the job. And -- and -- and it's -- we'll see."
Joe Biden,"My mother's maiden name was Finnegan; I believe her family was from Mayo. She was one of five children. Her grandfather and grandmother on both sides of the family were 100 percent Irish. The Finnegans came over after the first famine, around 1845. The other members of the extended family all came in that period through to about 1880. There is an ongoing debate as to whether Biden is an Irish, English or German name. My grandfather and my mother were never crazy about it being English and used to say, ""Tell him it's Dutch."" My grandmother was half-French, half-Irish. Her mother's name was Hannafy. So, on my father's side there is a minimum of one quarter Irish, and his father would insist that Biden was Irish, but he could never sustain that. He could never know that for sure. It's not common anywhere. I have gotten letters from around the world about it. For example, one fellow wrote me from India saying he had been in the British Foreign Service, had retired, was in his 70s, and wanted to know if we were related. He traced his roots back to Joseph and Emily Biden, who were in Liverpool in 1668. He thinks they were Huguenots, who came from either Germany or France. Then there is another guy who wrote to me from Australia who said he believed Biden was Irish. I'm anxious to know if it's Irish. Maybe this article will help. My brother Jim and I keep saying that we are actually going to take the time and go back. My mom's grandmother and grandfather Finnegan were both deceased before she was born. But her mother, my grandmother, used to tell her how the newly arrived Irish immigrants in Scranton, Pennsylvania, used to go up to Oliphant where the Finnegans lived. My great grandmother Finnegan was the only one who could read Gaelic and she used to read letters in Gaelic for those who could not read the letters from home, and she'd write back in Gaelic for them. My grandmother used to say, ""Remember, Joey Biden, the best drop of blood in you is Irish. "" Her grandfather Blewitt, her mother's father, emigrated from Dublin, we believe. It's said that he was a graduate of Dublin college. He settled in Scranton. Yes, that was Edward F. Blewitt, my grandmother's father. He was the first Irish Catholic state senator, at least in that region. He was also the co-founder of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, around 1908, and the ""Friendly Sons"" in Scranton have a plaque showing that he was one of the founding members and vice-president of that organization. Yes. A matter of fact, the ambience is probably stronger than the lineage. In other words, I grew up in Scranton, in a predominantly Irish neighborhood and an overwhelmingly Irish parish. It was a city that had some typically eastern ethnic divisions. There was a clear identification with people being Irish; 90 percent of my classmates identified themselves as such. I have very fond memories of growing up, although I did not think of it until I moved away, to Delaware. My Delaware experience was totally different. The centerpiece of life in Scranton was the church, the nuns, the priests, and the monsignor. Everybody had a sister who was a nun; everybody had a brother who was a priest. Vocations were a big deal. My interest in Ireland was first of all a cultural one, not political. I always thought of myself as Irish. I never called myself anything else. I was Irish to the point that my dad used to get angry at times. He'd say, ""Your mother's a Robinette, you're part French."" I always used to say, ""No, I'm Irish."" Looking back, I remember when I used to go and stay in my grandpop's house, where we lived for a while. I'd go up to Aunt Gertie, who had the third floor. I'd lie on the bed and she'd scratch my back and say, ""Now you remember, Joey, about the Black and Tans, don't you?"" She had never seen the Black and Tans, for the Lord's sake. She had no notion of them, but she could recite chapter and verse about them. Obviously, there were immigrants coming in who were able to talk about it, and who had relatives back there. She was old enough to know about them. If she were alive now she'd be 100 years old. She was born in 1887. After she'd finish telling me the stories, I'd sit there or lie in bed and think at the slightest noise, ""They're coming up the steps."" I've found out that we are different from the Irish from Ireland. We have a much more romanticized view of our history. I guess, like any Irishman, there are things I love and loathe about us Irish Americans. There is a maudlin side to us. But there is another side. There is a genuine pride, and we are the world's poets. We have heart and passion. On the debit side there are such things as the wake. When I look back, I see it gave me sustenance but I hated it. You know, everybody sitting there drinking and the corpse in the next room. It's brutal when you think about it. That's the other side, the Irishness of it, such a direct juxtaposition of life and death. There is something about the Irish that knows that to live is to be hurt, but we're still not afraid to live. And there is still such a zest for living, even though we as a people go into maudlin periods. My grandfather Finnegan always used to say, ""Just remember, Joe, if one Irishman sticks his head above the crowd, another Irishman will lop it off."" Then in the next breath he'd say, ""Airways remember you're Irish."" It was as if he had just come from the old sod. And hell, he'd never been to Ireland. I'm the first one of my family who visited Ireland. That's correct. I don't pretend to be an expert but I have a real interest in Irish history. To be honest with you, I picked Wolfe Tone for a number of reasons. One, I did not want to get involved in the question of who among the presidents I liked the best. And, in fact, Wolfe Tone is the embodiment of some of the things that I think are the noblest of all. He was a Protestant who formed the United Irishmen, back in the time of the 1798 Uprising. He had nothing to gain on the face of it, but he sought to relieve the oppression of the Catholics caused by the Penal Laws. He gave his life for the principle of civil rights for all people. I view him as a somewhat noble figure. He was obviously passionate, which I admire. He had the ability to make his own comfort secondary to the greater good, and he had a genuine honesty and compassion and empathy for the oppressed. And my God, were the Irish oppressed! Yes. My avocation is history. The thing I would like to do most, assuming I ever left this job, would be to teach political history in a university. I enjoy it. I like it a lot. I really do think that you have to know where you come from to have some sense about where you're going. For instance, I believe there are a lot of lessons to be learned from what didn't happen at appropriate times in Ireland. So your strong opposition to the new extradition between Britain and the U.S. while on the Foreign Relations Committee is understandable in that context. I felt strongly about the treaty. It was the attitudinal thing that bothered me so much. There was an unwillingness to acknowledge the deprivation of the court system in the north, the Diplock courts, no jury trials, et cetera. Then there was the Administration's desire to go out and justify the treaty, saying the issue was terrorism. It really wasn't about terrorism. They never made a case, in my view. I think that, more than anything else, it was a reflection on how we have never -- I'm going to get myself in real trouble here -- come to grips with our relationship with Great Britain. There is an overwhelming admiration and awe for the British jurisprudential system, a phenomenal respect for British majesty and power. In the sense that many Irish are ambivalent about the IRA, we have been ambivalent about Britain. We have fought them and we have loved them. As they are in the twilight of their position as a world power, we are reluctant to take issue with them. And this treaty is something that Margaret Thatcher wanted. So rather than challenge it we shirked it. Oh, over half a dozen times actually, mostly for fun. I like Ireland. I have not made a big deal about it when I've gone. I've not met with government officials. I've just gone. The last time, I guess, was probably 1981. The time before that was before I was married. I went over with my brother Jim and we watched the All-Blacks play Ireland in rugby. I'm a rugby player -- well, I did play rugby. Subsequently, my sister went over, and one of my regrets is that I haven't taken my mother over yet. That Irish people must be amused, or bemused, about us Irish Americans. That was one of the things that struck me when I visited Ireland -- how out of sync Irish Americans were about what Ireland is. Even just culturally, I mean, beyond the political questions. Some historians believe that because most of the American Irish are descended from those forced out of the country by the Famine experience, which was in effect their Holocaust, their culture evolved from there, hating the English for good reason, and so on. Ireland on the other hand developed differently. I think that's a good point because the famine really is the jumping off point in a big way. Now the Irish in Delaware are very different, truly, very, very different from the Irish in South Philadelphia, in Fishtown, in Scranton, in Pinebrook, in Greenridge, Sandyhill, et cetera. That is because they came over differently. The DuPont Company in Delaware concluded that the most reliable workers were the Irish. As early as the 1820s, they were sending ships over to Ireland bringing back workers. So the first people who came did not do so as a consequence of the awful wrenching dislocation. When they came, they came into a very paternalistic society. For example, the DuPont family built the parish church where I live, for their Irish workers. Ironically, for a long time the family held that title to the church, and would not, as rumor goes, give it to the diocese. It was right on the outskirts of the DuPont family compound. So the Irish up there are very different. For example, we have a Friends of Ireland Dinner in Delaware. It's protestant and catholic and they're all Irish. Now in Scranton, ""Friendly Sons,"" means you don't have any orange on your body anywhere, do you? Check your underwear [Laughs]. You know, it's no foolin' around. It is presumptuous, in my opinion, to think that any outsider, particularly from across the Atlantic, can have a definitive impact, or even necessarily a positive impact on a situation that is consequences of 300 years of travail. But having said that, I would probably dare tread where angels fear to go, and say it is something that is not inappropriate to have on the agenda when the United States is dealing with what is a true, faithful and legitimate real ally, Great Britain. Indeed, if it is not inappropriate for us to suggest that efforts should be made in the ' Middle East and Latin America, it's not inappropriate that we should take what is a positive step in Ireland -- that is the commitment that the Anglo-Irish Accord be backed up. Some of us have pushed the dollar side of this Anglo-Irish Agreement with not as much success as we would like. But as President, that is one of the things that I would continue to do. Secondly, the notion of investment in the Republic is important, because I think the stronger the Republic is, the better the chance of an ultimate resolution. Even though it seems unrelated, I think there is a relationship. I think the demonstration of success in the south impacts upon the fear and trepidation the British may have about the north. Also, I think it's not inappropriate to suggest to my British friends that they acknowledge the difficulty of the problem. If I was going to be cynical, I would say they deserve it. But you don't want to make one generation pay for the sins of a past generation. For instance, the fact that back in history there was a Queen Elizabeth I, who started the plantations that have now come home to roost, is not the fault of some kid living in Liverpool. It's not his fault. I think that, irrespective of the sad history, the correct notion is there should be strong support for the Anglo-Irish Accord, which is a first step, coupled with steps for meaningful integration, if not coexistence, in the north, between the divided communities. Biden: One of the ways, it seems to me, to deal with that, is to integrate the schools and have Catholics and Protestants educated together. I am not suggesting that is easy. It's not easy; it's very, very difficult. We know from our own experience in this country, how difficult integrating schools can be. I also think the British Government needs to step forward, to speak out more affirmatively against the Paisleys of the North, and treat them with as much disdain as they treat the Provos. I think they're all bums in terms of all those senseless killings. My grandfather Finnegan used to talk about 1916 and there was a notion that to be part of the IRA then was a noble thing. If you read the current Provos' manifesto to me, an Irish American, or just an American, I cannot believe that the Irish Americans here would support it. If I stood up in Fishtown, which is an Irish section in Philadelphia or went into a bar and read the manifesto of the Provos, they'd say, ""You communist pig."" Forget it, they'd have me on the floor. The other thing that is important in the south and in the north, where unemployment is rampant, is jobs. I used to have a teacher, Sister Michael Mary, who used to say, ""An idle mind is the devil's workshop."" An idle man or woman is a discontented person. Idleness breeds on itself, enlarges the vicious circle. I think legislators over there have to take more risks. I have a sense of the frustration and confusion they feel, even those who wish to push more. I guess the best we could do from here is gently prod and strongly support when the prodding occurs. I believe it's important to recognize the inevitability of unity, but not with a timetable. To do that, I believe, would be much less troublesome if there was an integration of the communities based on mutual trust and respect. I think that one of the reasons that you have resistance, on both sides, to integration is that neither extreme wants that to occur. Such sentiments on the part of a contender for the job of President of the United States would probably be denounced as interference by groups in Britain, certainly, perhaps even in Ireland. If we have a moral obligation in other parts of the world, why in God's name don't we have a moral obligation to Ireland? It's part of our blood. It's the blood of my blood, bone of my bone. A nation should not deny its cultural ties and heritage. It's not that we don't have phenomenal cultural ties with Great Britain, of which I'm proud. Although I acknowledge it's dangerous; any thing that is done over there will take real courage. I want to support it. To what extent do you think the Irish themselves and their failure to rid themselves of the British or live in peaceful co-existence are part of the problem? You know, I'm not sure. When you look at it from the standpoint of Irish history, what choice did we have? It's not like we didn't try. If you subjugate a people for generations and take their land, their birthright, their right to read, their right to eat, it has to have a long-term debilitating effect. But to me, the fact that we have never lost the sense of nobility and the culture and learning is important. Don't forget the monks were hanging off the cliffs of Skellig Michael in the Dark Ages, protecting the outpost of not only Christianity but also learning. I am not one of these guys who is going to go back and tell you that all culture resides in Irish culture, but there is a great deal to be proud of. Not withstanding all of that, the surprise to me is that they continue to maintain a sense of dignity. Look, suppose you just landed on this planet and said, ""O.K. I'm going to press a button that will instantly allow me to see four hundred years of the history of this section of the world."" You'd say, ""My God, how is there anything left."" It took a hell of a long time to get there, and it's going to take a hell of a long time -- pray God, not four hundred years -- but a hell of a long time to get out. I was reading in your magazine about Michael Collins and the debate still raging about how and why he died. I thought about my grandfather engaging in fierce debates and talking about De Valera. Was he right? Was he wrong? You know, that was the culmination of 300 years of war, that civil war. What other nation has been as bled of its people for so long? No. I see myself as an Irish Catholic. I am not the heir to, but I feel a genuine kinship to the passion and the dreams of Camelot. The thing that always lifts men and women to great heights, to those heroic proportions, is not specific programmatic initiatives but insights as to who we are and what we are, the notion that we can be larger than ourselves for the moment. But I don't view myself in a tragic role. I've had my tragedy but so has everyone else. That's part of what I mean about what it means to be Irish. Not only Irish, what it is to be human. There are tens of thousands of women and men in this country who have suffered more than I have. I mean, they have suffered what I have suffered but they have not had the phenomenal network I had available to me, getting me through. In my family it's not a question of having to ask; if you have to ask, then it's already too late. After my difficulties I had a mother and sisters who moved in and raised my children, and a brother who stood by me. I was really lucky. Then God gave me another good Presbyterian girl who put my life back together again. It has always been important. To be honest with you, the tragedy shook it a little bit, for a moment. You kind of feel sorry for yourself, thinking, ""Is there a God?"" Does my religion mean anything? Why would this happen?"" I think everybody goes through that when difficulties occur in life. I am not suggesting to you that I am a deeply religious man, but I deeply believe in my religion. It's very important to me and I have to admit that sometimes I don't know whether it's cultural, theological or practical. I'm not sure why, but I believe that some real wisdom has accrued over 1,987 continuous years of Catholicism, as long as you take it in a way that understands that there are significant mistakes that my church has made, but that it has an amazing resilience which I admire and I think that it's an important part of my life. For example, I don't know why, truthfully, but I can't miss mass. I never miss mass. Even the last two weekends when I went skiing and I dragged myself off the slopes to be sure I got to five o'clock mass in Salt Lake City. We walked in and there was an Irish priest just walking down the aisle; and he looked at me and said, with an Irish grin, ""Boys, you' re a little late."" I looked down and said, ""Jeez, Father, I'm embarrassed."" So we stepped out and everybody was walking out. I said to my boys, ""Look, wait until Father goes back into the sacristy and we'll make a visit, light a candle and say a prayer at least."" So we walked in and saw Father in the back in the vestry. He turned around and started laughing. He was from Tipperary. He said, ""How about if I give you some communion?"" So we went up and he served communion, and I said, ""Father, how about coming out to dinner with us?"" So we sat and shot the breeze, we had a great time, for about two and a half hours. We talked a lot about Ireland and he asked, with typical Irish exaggeration, ""Have you ever visited the most beautiful spot in the world?"" I just took a stab at it, and said, ""I've been to the Ring of Kerry a number of times."" He said, ""How did you know?"" Then he started telling me about when he was a kid and went camping there. At any rate, I practice my religion. It's no big deal. It's said that one of John F. Kennedy's biggest legacies was that he showed that being an Irish Catholic was not a liability. Do you agree? I think that's correct. Being a Catholic more than an Irish Catholic. It didn't have as much to do with him being Irish as with his being Catholic. I really believe that President Kennedy did really settle the question about Catholicism in this country, in a major way. Editor's note: this interview was conducted before Cuomo dropped out of the 1988 Presidential race and at a time when his background was coming under increasing scrutiny. I think Cuomo is getting a bad rap on the Italian rather than the Catholic part. But I don't know. I think that Governor Cuomo is unjustly getting criticism in part because he has had the w ill and the knowledge to engage the Church and be engaged as a thinking Catholic. So he has conducted his debate with God in public. He has engaged in and spoken at length, I think to his credit, on the source and depth of his beliefs. It would be no different than if you were a Presbyterian saying, or writing in your diaries, ""Today I went back and re-thought again whether Calvin was correct and if predestination is something I should be bound by."" Then everybody would be saying, ""Hey, wait a minute, how about this Presbyterian Scotsman we have here."" The prospect of being President is a daunting one. Maybe it should frighten me. It doesn't frighten me, but it chastens me to realize that I'm not sure that there could ever be any woman or man who could be prepared, in a purely objective sense, to be President of the United States. I think that the President of the United States affects the fortunes of the free world, more than any other single person. If you look at it in those terms it's a chilling thought. But I think that the way to deal with problems is to look at the pieces you can handle. Look at it, not so much in terms of the enormity of the task, but in terms of the pieces of the task all of which you think you can handle. But if you look at it in total, you say, my goodness, I'm not, nobody is, capable of doing that. Well, that's the hardest thing. I think the most difficult question, at least for me, relates to what impact it will have upon the family. Not the impact on whether they can handle it or not handle it, but whether or not it will impact on my ability to be with them, to enjoy with them, to share with them, to be part of the family. These are the most important considerations to me. If I run, I'm not going to like the fact -- a trivial thing in most people's minds, they will probably read this and say, God, this guy must be crazy -- that I will miss most of my son's football games. I go home every day. I like very much getting up every morning with my five-year-old daughter, getting her dressed and fixing her breakfast. She doesn't need me to do that. As a matter of fact, she has got to the point now that she can do it herself but she is patronizing me. It's a two-hours each way for me, from this chair to my front door. As my dear mother used to say, if you hung by your thumb long enough you'd get used to it. I'm doing it long enough, and it's worth it. It's worth the effort, even though I leave here at nine O'clock, and don't get home until 11. People here, including my staff, say, ""What are you going home for."" But I feel good about it. I feel good about being able to walk in and go up when they're asleep and kiss my 18-year old goodnight and my 17-year old goodnight, and go in and lie down with my daughter for two minutes. Wake her up a little to let her know I'm there, scratch her back and tell her to wake me up in the morning. To me they are important things. Not just to me, but also to 99 percent of the people on earth, I think. Yes. If being President were the same as campaigning for President, then I would not try to be President. But as President, the train doesn't leave until you get there [Laughs]. Granted, there is phenomenal pressure, but I believe I can handle the pressure. My family can handle the pressure. The question is, ""Am I going to have any prospect of being with them, to handle it together with them?"" I am not one who, in my life, subscribes to the notion that it's not how much time, but the quality of the time. That's not my experience with children. My experience is that it's vital that Daddy be available. When they catch a fish, they want to show you the fish right then. They don't want to wait for four days for you to say; ""now we have three hours of quality time. It's you and me."" Most of the important conversations, the most meaningful things that have occurred in my relationship with my children have not been planned. They've been spontaneous discussions. These are the times that make you say, ""God, I'm glad I'm a father."" I don't mean to imply that quality time isn't better than no time, but the best time is the availability of time. We have a rule in my family. The kids call it ""wild card."" From the time that they were little kids -- it really came about when they were four and five -- after the accident, they have been able to say, ""Dad, I want to come with you today."" Regardless of where I'm going. It makes no difference. They come, period. I had almost forgotten it, because the boys of late have not exercised their 'wild card' very much. I was going to make a Westchester University commencement speech, for their fall commencement. As I'm walking out the door, my daughter said, ""Daddy, I decided I want to come."" A reporter for the Congressional Quarterly is covering me this day, and she looks at me like, ""you're late."" So I said, ""Oh, honey, you wouldn't like it."" She said, ""Daddy, don't say you talk too long. I like to hear you talk."" I said, ""Honey it's going to be boring."" She said, ""Daddy, I want to come."" I said, ""Oh Honey."" The she said, ""Daddy, wild card."" I ran upstairs, changed her clothes in three minutes, packed a little duffle-bag for her and we all went off to the commencement. So everybody tells me, ""You can't do that and run for President."" Well, I refuse to accept that. I am probably going to get beaten, but I'm not going to accept that. If I run [Laughs]. Sure I would -- try and stop me -- I'd love it. That's like asking Cuomo if he would go to Italy if he were elected. Senator Biden, thank you. "
Joe Biden,"Happy New Year. It has been. You know, we we weren't married yet, and Jill was at the house and my mom and dad came over and family, and, you know, my dad used to have an expression, he'd say family is the beginning, the middle and the end. Matter of fact, if you saw here in the studio, we have two of our grandchildren with us right now on New Year's Eve. Optimism. I'm never been more optimistic about America in my whole career. And, you know, the interesting thing is, we've been through so much, so much difficulty, the pandemic, the flu, a whole range of things. And look how the American people fought back and they got up, and -- and there's nothing that can hold them down. We're the most unique country in the world. We're a product of --  that's what we believe in. And so I just think I'm --- I'm really optimistic. Local law enforcement. You better listen to her. Happy New Year. And to all of America."
Joe Biden,"Happy to be here. From the folks who did it, I was. The vast majority of Republicans weren't that way. But, you know, there's still a significant element of what I call the MAGA Republicans, you know, the ""Make America Great Again"" Republicans. And it's you know, I didn't. I kind of anticipated but there are an awful lot of -- The speaker was gracious and so was you know, there were a lot of members. Well, you know, as you know, Judy, I spent most of my career with the Congress and members of the Congress. I know, I know the place well. I know the system well. And I always feel comfortable when I'm up on the Hill, for real. Did most of my life. Wasn't too bad at it either. There's a lot more than that. It's going to make a gigantic difference. Look, we've already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Just in two years. That's more jobs than anyone's created anyway. And and we paid for it all. We actually reduce the debt, the deficit, by $1.7 trillion over two years. And what it's about is about giving working folks a chance. And I don't mean just labor. I mean, look, you've probably heard me say before, I've never been a big fan of trickle down economics. Family I was raised in, a lot didn't trickle down to our table. But, you know, the middle class, when it does well, everybody does well. So my goal was when I got elected was to campaign on this bill from the bottom up in the middle out. When that happens, the poor have a chance up and the middle class does well and the wealthy always do well. So. Well it will have a profound effect. I mean, look, all just as I was told we were going to lose big the last election, the off-year election, I said we weren't. Just as we were told I wasn't going to be able to pass Inflation Reduction Act or the CHIP. We passed them all. And and what's happening now is people don't understandably, don't realize all of our past back in June, July, August to September, and is only coming to fruition now. For example, Judy, we pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world, yet people didn't know until January, even though we talked about it since last summer, that prescription drugs costs were going to go down and, for example, insulin. Insulin for seniors instead of being four or five hundred bucks a month is now $35 a month. And people are going, 'whoa'. And there's so much more to come. And look, I think we start off with the proposition -- I do anyway -- that the vast majority of Americans don't think the tax system is fair. I mean, the vast majority, including, you know, wealthy, well-off suburbanites. And the idea you got a thousand trillionaires and they pay less for the percentage of their income than a schoolteacher does. I mean, so there's a lot going on. We got a lot passed and its now just they're going to start to roll out. Because the polls don't matter anymore. You got to make, what, 40, 50 calls and on a cell phone to get someone to answer a poll? Even the pollsters, you talk to them. Ask them what they think about this. Look. Oh, I know the policy. By the way, if you ask the same things. Do they support the rebuilding infrastructure America? Overwhelmingly support. Ask anybody. Do they support the CHIPS and Science Act where we've attracted $300 billion in investments? We invented these chips. They're coming back to America. We're going to be the leaders again. When you ask them about whether or not they think they're paying too much, too much for drug prices. Overwhelmingly, yes. So it's all just like, look, people went through hell the last several years, the last five years in the pandemic. We lost a million people, dead. And so every time you turn on the news, are you reporting any positive news, I'm not I'm not meaning you personally, editorially. So you turn on the television and everything's down. And so people understandably are down. No. No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession? Well, I think it's a number of reasons. Number one, I think that we. There was a deliberate effort by the last guy to play on people's fears and to appeal to base instincts. I mean, and it's just it's not who we are, but people are -- you know, I also noticed a fair amount of Republicans standing up last night and clapping. You know, for example, when I pointed out that some Republicans are talking about eliminating Medicare. They said, ""no, no, no."""" I said oh, okay. That means all of you are for supporting Medicare? Everybody raise your hand. They all raised their hand. So guess what? We accomplished something. Unless they break their word. There are going to be no cuts in Medicare, Social Security. My point is, I think it's the way we talk to each other. And I think, you know, look, I think what happened was that the party started to take for granted ordinary blue collar workers. And they really got hurt. They got hurt the previous four or five years and everything went wrong in their lives. Look at all the factories that have closed and left you know, the United States. Look at all the things that have happened. But they're coming back now. And I've just gotta to make sure everybody knows what we've done. Watch how it unfolds and see what happens. I don't think it was better or worse. I think what happened was then we had a different set of problems, but we didn't have many people playing on the fears of the American people. There was just genuine debate about and discord about the war in Vietnam. The civil rights movement, which got me involved in politics in the first place, was just reaching a culmination point where we really began to pass the Civil Rights Act and a number of things. So I think it's a process. And I think that most Americans are of the view that we've got this. It's gotten too mean. It's gotten too, too personal and too divisive. And I think one of the things -- the message they sent this last election was 'come on, work together, get something done for us.' I think. I think the American public, I think when we vote on whether or not to extend the Medicare benefit, I mean, health care benefits to ordinary Americans, not just on Medicare and Medicaid. I think we will see that. We say that insulin should be available for 35 bucks for every American out there. I think you're going to see a lot of things done because people are becoming aware of what we can do, and we're starting to see those things happening. And one of the reasons I'm here at this facility, you know, the laborers now, most people think that, you know, we're going to be a laborer. Well, you just sign up, you show up. They have four years apprenticeships to become a laborer. It's like going to college again, not again. So going to college. We're the best trained workers in the world. And for example, when I asked the. I know I can. Yeah. By the way, we got them through the things I'm talking about. We've already gotten through. And I think it's a matter of just demonstrating what we've done. Public's not going to pay attention that. They want these guys to do something. If the only thing they can do is make up things about my family. It's not going to go very far. Sure. He's an impressive guy, isn't he? Look. I told, it's now public. I told the military I wanted to shoot it down when it was safe to do it. They said it was unsafe to do it over land. They said they can learn a lot in the meantime by watching it go across the country. As soon as they had a chance to shoot it down over water, they did and they recovered major pieces of it to determine if we can learn anything from what they garnered and what kind of equipment they had. You know, there were several of these balloons that during the last administration they didn't even know they were there. They didn't even do anything about them. So, look, I just think that the idea that it was a dereliction of duty, I think, is a bizarre notion. China knows exactly that, what the deal is with us. No. I know. I talked to him. Xi JinPing before. I in our team talks to their people. After, I haven't talked to him during this. But, look, I mean, the idea of shooting down a balloon that's gathering information over America and, that makes relations worse? Look, I made it real clear to Xi Jinping that we're going to compete fully with China, but we're not looking for conflict. And and that's been the case so far. China wants very, has… Let me put it another way as I said, you can think of any other, and you're very informed in foreign policy, can you think of any other world leader who would trade places with Xi Jinping? Not a joke. You think of any who would? I can't think of one. This man has enormous problems. Enormous. He has also great potential. But so far, he has an economy that's not functioning very well. He's in a situation where he is -- for example, you know, everybody assumed that China would be all in with Russia and Ukraine. But they're not all in it. As a matter of fact I called him this summer to say this is not a threat, just an observation: look what's happened to Russia. 600 American corporations have pulled out of Russia. From McDonald's to Exxon. And I said, You've told me all along that the reason why you need a relationship with the United States in Europe is so they invest in China. So who's going to invest in China if you engage in the same kind of deal? You notice there's not been much going on there. It's a firm commitment. Look, when is the last… If these guys, Jordan or whoever you mentioned. The idea that the Russian military, with over a hundred thousand forces would invade and try to maraud Ukraine, and us stand by and do nothing. Come on? And what I've done, and I think I'm very proud of it, I've been able to unite NATO completely. He was convinced NATO would collapse. NATO would not be engaged. I've been able to get our our Asian allies to join with the Europeans in terms of taking on Russia, whether or not. So I mean, we are, we have a better relationship and tighter control over our destiny now than we've ever had. And, you know, we have Germany increasing our budget by over 2%. You have Japan doing the same thing. I mean, I just don't -- I mean, if these guys don't want to help Ukraine, I get it. They don't want to do that. But what are they going to do when Ukraine rolls, when Russia rolls across Ukraine or into Belarus or anywhere else? Yeah, it is. Look, there's no way that Putin is going to be able to cope. He's already lost Ukraine. The idea that he's ever going to be able -- Well, here's what he thought. He thought that if he invaded Ukraine, first of all, he'd get a welcome by every Russian speaker, they'd say, ""come on in."" And secondly, he thought what would happen is that NATO would collapse. NATO would not do anything. They'd be afraid to act. Then he thought anyway, go down the line. None of that's happening. What they've informed me not to speak to this issue to anyway, try to prejudice the investigation that's going on. But what I was talking about was what was laid out. All these documents were a top secret, code word and all the rest. And I'm not at liberty and I'm not even sure, I made voluntarily -- no one's had to threaten to do anything -- voluntarily opened every single aperture I have in the house, offices, everything. For them to come and look and spend hours searching my home. Invited them. Nobody. And so, in the best of my knowledge, the kinds of things they picked up were things that from 1974 and stray papers. There may be something else, I don't know. But one of the things that happened is that what was not done well is as they packed up my offices to move them, they didn't do the kind of job that should have been done to go thoroughly through every single piece of literature that's there. But, I'll just let the investigation, you know, decide what's going on and we'll see what happens. Watch me. It's all I can say. I mean, you know, it goes from one extreme to the other. Last night I was -- I heard that people are saying, Well, just watch Biden, my God, age is not an issue anymore. Look, I'm a great respector of fate. I would be completely, thoroughly honest with the American people if I thought there was any health problem, anything that would keep me from being able to do the job. And and, so we'll see. But, you know, I just -- I think people have to just watch me. I haven't made that decision. That's my intention, I think. But I haven't made that decision firmly yet. Thank you, Judy. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"Hey, Jimmy, how are you man? I'm honored to be on. Thanks for inviting me. Well, you know, we used to be the number one to have the best infrastructure in the world, highways, bridges, the whole works. And now we ranked number 13th in the world. And we just -- and makes, it has a lot to do with quality of life. It has a lot to do with whether or not we're going to be competitive. And for example, one thing it does, we're going to replace all the lead pipes in America that are causing people to get sick, get cancer and kids being able to drink clean water. We're going to make sure that we have everywhere in the country, rural and urban and suburban. We have internet connections because the world is changing and we're so far behind the curve. But the big thing is going to do, is going to create millions of jobs. And it's going to change the quality of life for an awful lot of people around the country. Yes. Yeah, what's in it is the ability for working class and middle-class people to have their cost of living cut significantly. For example, there is money in there to make sure that there's the ability to care for childcare right now, if you're in New York, and you're a man or woman, having childcare for your children, your fund $21,000 and $25,000 a year to be able to do that. Well, most people can't do that. So, people leave the workforce. This will mean you don't have to pay more than 7% of your income saving tens of thousands of dollars over time. We also provided in a bill the Build Back Better initiative. We're going to make sure you're able to send your three and four and five-year-olds to school, which will increase exponentially their chances of succeeding. All the studies show, Jimmy, that 47% better chance of graduating from high school, no matter what the background you come from, no matter what home you come from, and be able to go on to get to school. What better can happen for America then have a better educated population. So, there's a whole range of things that are in there, that are going to really reduce essentially, the cost of living for people in a reasonable rational way. And by the way, every single bit of that bill is paid for. No one making less than 400,000 bucks you will pay and then an additional set in taxes, as well as it will not increase the deficit one penny. Well, I hope it will, though, you know, I don't have a single Republican vote right now to pass it. And so, it's going to be tough, but I think we can get it done. And if we don't get, we'll keep adding until we get it done. Jimmy, look, the truth is that before COVID hit the Trump arm of the Republican Party, which seems to be the Republican Party now, did not even show up at the Kennedy Center. They wouldn't go to the awards. So, all the people you have, as we saw at that event, which was a very fulsome event, or people who in fact, the Republicans, but they're the kind of like for example, a lot of Republicans and Democrats do so get really on well together. For example, one of the reasons that a little bit late coming on is because -- not coming on with to do the taping here, is because I did Bob Dole's eulogy today. He asked me on his deathbed, whether I would do his eulogy. We're friends, we disagree but we're friends. We used to have an awful lot of that relationship, and they're still exist, except that the AQnon and the extreme elements, the Republican Party and what Donald Trump keeps sort of seems to me feeding the, you know, the big lie. It makes it awful hard. There's -- and I think most Republicans, there's an awful lot of Republicans in Congress, I think would agree. Yeah, I thought it was great to see you there. And I thought -- I said, I was -- we gave you a standing ovation because I go, here he is. He's bringing class back. He's a classy guy. And you're brining class back to the office and I thought it was -- Very kind, Jimmy, thank you. Well, I think what I do is have more people listen to your song. I think that will get moved. Well, it is. It's really important, Jimmy. Look the death -- look, we're so far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the science and technology to produce the vaccines. And now we found out that, that the -- if you have your two shots from Moderna, or from Pfizer, or the one shot from J&J, what happens is this booster shot not only brings the levels back up of immunity, I mean to deal with the fighting off the virus, any of the viruses, but it brings it up exponentially. And so, if you want to be sure, you're going to be OK. And the other good news, Jimmy, is that we now have five, six and seven-year-olds are able to be vaccinated. As well as teenagers. And so, we're moving, we're moving. Now. I don't know, the politicization of this, making it become a political statement if you get the shot and somehow, I don't know what that, anyway. Here's the deal, Jimmy, it's -- the bottom line is that the way to avoid this virus is to get two shots, and then get the booster shot. It's available. We have the medicines available. It will make a gigantic difference. And even if you don't care so much about yourself, think about your kids, your brother, your sister, your co-worker that make -- and this stuff about, you know, Biden's mandating these things happening, and it's un-American. Look at this way, it's patriotic to get this done. Not a joke. It's patriotic to get it done. Well, not anymore. I'm joking. I'll pay attention in mid-60 Well, look, here's the deal. I think that it's -- we banana less than a year, a lot has happened. Look, people are afraid, people are worried, and people are getting so much inaccurate information to them. I don't mean about me, but about their situation. And so they're, you know, they're being told that, you know, Armageddon is on the way. But truth is the economy is growing more than it has any time and close to 60 years. The unemployment rates down to 4.2% is going to go lower in my view. We do have inflation on things that, in fact, matter to people's lives. You know, when you show up at a gas station and it's $3.50 at your pump, although now because I took 50 billion barrels -- million barrels, the other call the Oil Petroleum Reserve, the gasoline is down below $3 in many places. It's going to come down, it's going to move. But in the meantime, people are worried, and they're worried about whether or not, you know, they have a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, who has gotten COVID. And they don't know what to do about. I mean, so there's a lot of anxiety. And my job is to be straightforward shoot from the shoulder, but people know exactly what the truth is, and lay out how I'm going to try to make life better for them. Well, send him over. Look, I was Vice President for eight years. I knew what the job was. And I don't -- no one should feel sorry for me. It's a greatest honor anybody can have in their whole life in my view to be president of the United States. But what the difference is, the difference is that, when you're in -- when you're in the Congress, and I had important jobs in the Congress, as a senator, I was chairman of important committees. But being presidents like being chairman of every single committee, nothing gets to my desk, unless it hasn't been able to be solved before it got to my desk. So, by definition, it's more difficult. Harry Truman had a great line. He said about being friends. He said, ""The buck stops here."" I used to be -- I kid Barack -- President Obama, who was a good friend, and we served with eight years as friends together. And I used to say to him, instead of him thanking me for, I got to be the last guy in the room to give him advice. That was the deal we had. And I get to -- he thanked me, and I get to walk out and say, look, I give you the advice, you got to make the decision. You know, and what happens is going to be on you, but that's part of the deal. But look, I have enormous confidence. You're going to think I'm going to realize how -- what a naive guy I am. But I really have faith the end of the day, the American people are going to get it. They understand. They understand, given half a shot. They've never ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. You just got to give them a shot. What I did notice is that it is -- there is a sense that you realize it's not your house, it's the people's house. And that sounds corny -- it's the people's house. But you realize that that's the case. And one of the things that I find, Jimmy, and I think you really would associate with this, I -- Jill and I feel, we come from middle class backgrounds. We both are college graduates. We worked like how we have fathers who didn't go what -- anyway, the end result was that we're not used to people waiting on us. And so, in the White House, there -- you know, there's somebody to, you know, make your breakfast, or someone to pack your clothes, or someone to carry your bag. We now have a deal, and they're great, the guys who run the kitchen on the second floor is -- we don't have them come in for -- do breakfast for us, because there's no need for them to have to do breakfast for us. We can make our own eggs or, you know, pour a bowl of a -- -- cereal. Well, I don't. Jill does. [Laughter] I tell you what? I'll tell you a true story. When I was -- when Jill was going to graduate school, which was her life it seems -- -- when I was a senator, I get home really quickly and she -- we trade off, and I -- and my daughter will be there. And I'd -- and she'd take off for school, night school. Anyway, to make a long story short, my daughter was being interviewed when she was about, I don't know, 9, 10 years old, and said, can your daddy cook for you? And said, my daddy can't do much. He can boil water, make biscotti, but he can't do much else. [Laughter] And guess what? She's right. She's right. I hope we're going to be talking about how we've gotten COVID more under control. I hope we're going to be talking about how we have actually reduced the burden on middle class folks financially, that salaries continue to go up. I hope we're going to talk about unemployment still going down. I hope we're going to be talking about inflation being under control. And -- but the other thing, Jimmy, I really hope that we're going to be able to demonstrate that we made worldwide progress on the environment, because I think it's a critical thing, and I pray to God, pray God, we will have passed the John Lewis Act and the Voting Rights Act because what's going on now in about 30 states is literally un-American. It's about trying to prevent people from voting rather than allow them to vote. So, there's -- there's a full plate, but I think we can do it. I'm optimistic about the future. And I'm optimistic about this country. We are -- as I told everybody, including everyone from the leader to China, to Russia and everyone else, that I don't know anybody who wouldn't trade places -- world leader who wouldn't trade places with my job versus theirs, because we have more available to us, we have more capacity, we have more science and technology and decency I think than any country in the world. And so, I think -- I think the sky is the limit is what we can do in this -- in this second quarter of the 21st century. Well, Jimmy -- Jimmy, maybe you ought to come down and have dinner with me. [Laughter]"
Joe Biden,"We're here! [Laughs] We're fine. We're fine. Watching your parade. You're doing a good job. You're responsible for the good weather of the parade, too. That's the best part. Well, I want to say thanks to the firefighters, the police officers, first responders. They never take a break. And, by the way, we're going to be talking to some of our troops later today, both here and abroad. And I hope everybody remembers we end every single day with ""God bless our troops,"" for real. Well, we've been coming up to Nantucket for -- since we first got married, the whole family. And it's become a tradition. And we're going to go stop at the fire department. We're going to make sure that we spend some time on the island thanking the first responders here. And we're going to go see the Coast Guard, the military. You too. Hope you get a little time to enjoy it. We're going to give Al a call too and see how he's doing. All right."
Joe Biden,"Thank you, Senator. You've been incredible. You were incredible for me before the Nevada caucus, during and after. I think you're one of the great future leaders of this country. I really mean it. You've really done a heck of a job and you're so well respected. Look, folks, I want to say good evening and thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I want this to be a conversation where I get to hear your stories and you get to ask me questions that are on your mind. I'll just say a few things to the head start here. It's going to take me about 10 minutes to do it. Earlier today, my good friend, and he is a friend, Bernie Sanders announced he was suspending his campaign. Bernie's always been a passionate voice for progress and he put his heart and soul, not only in the running for president, but also the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life. He's inspired and energized millions of supporters, especially young voters, to join him in championing a progressive vision for our country. He didn't just run a political campaign. He created a movement and that's a good thing for the nation and for our future. While Bernie's campaign has ended, I know his leadership's going to continue, including working to address the incredible challenges we're now facing, the ones that are facing this nation under this president. My heart goes out to everyone out there suffering from COVID-19. We all know the greatest tragedy in all of this is how many lives are being lost, how many are infected and suffering alone. One friend, her mother was dying of another illness of cancer and she's in the hospital, but she couldn't go and see her. They had to put a phone up to her ear. It's so, so hard for so many people. This is going to continue to be a very hard week for our country. This disease is not only tearing through the nation, it's devastating families. It's wrecking the economy and we're starting to see it magnify some of our worst systemic inequities. Early data shows countries and counties in this country have major black populations and Hispanic populations, the coronavirus infection rates in the black communities are three times as high as they are in white majority residents' communities. Death rates, nearly six times higher. That's unconscionable and never should happen. We need more data. We also need more data on how the Latino and other communities of color are impacted, other minority communities, so we know exactly what has to be done. Black Americans are still less likely to be insured as are Latinos, less likely to have access to healthcare, less likely to have had treatment for underlying conditions like asthma and diabetes to make them more vulnerable to this virus today. They're more likely to face exposure to pollutants than anyone else associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Their death rates are higher. Black Americans are also less likely to have a job they can do just from home. Like many Latinos in America, they're more likely to have to choose between their health, and their healthcare, and their paycheck. This virus is shedding light on the structural racism that still exists and plagues our laws, our institutions, and our culture. These past few weeks have been devastating for our economy. We're going to have to do an awful lot of work to rebuild after this is over. As I said over and over in the past weeks, I believe that a top priority for us is using the money, the $2 trillion from the so called Cares Act that Congress passed, to keep as many workers on payroll as possible so they can hit the ground running, but so many people, including some of you, have already lost your jobs. 6.6 million new unemployment claims just reported last week. Who knows what it's going to be this coming week. 3.3 million the week before. We're getting more reporting tomorrow. That's already more than 10 million Americans who've lost their jobs through no fault of their own because of this pandemic. Hospitality workers, I need not tell you about that, Senator, and in Las Vegas. Service industry workers, highly skilled workers in construction, so many more, union members and nonunion members. I know people are worried, not just if you or your loved one are going to get sick. You're worried about how you're going to make the rent, worried about how to pay the bills, keep food on the table, worried about when the relief checks are going to come through that have been voted by the Congress. That's the key part of the 10 point, what I call, make work checklist that I put together last week and offered to the President of the United States, President Trump, so that he knows how to think about what it takes to administer a massive federal recovery program. One of the key pieces is making sure to get those unemployment checks out on time and in full. We have to make workers who have been laid off financially whole. States are already overwhelmed by the millions of claims with more to come. States need more staff, better technology, more robust systems to both accept claims and get those funds out the door. The White House should have had their back. We need to get those relief checks into the hands of folks as quickly as possible using direct deposits, prepaid debit cards, whenever we can, but here's what we know above all. The money and the plans that are in the Cares Act won't be enough in the first time around. We're going to have to do more. The unemployment insurance payments, they will have to keep people afloat. Right now, they're set to expire. These payments should be available as long as they are needed. The federal government should backstop the states on this to make sure that they continue to make those payments. We should have a rent freeze and a moratorium on evictions during this public health crisis because no one should have to worry about losing their home during a pandemic or where they live during a pandemic. The next package, this is already being discussed, should include student debt relief for at least $10,000 per person to help ease the burden on young people who were already struggling to get by before the coronavirus. We have to make sure everyone has access to maintain affordable health insurance coverage. We should be making it easier, not harder. Let me put it another way. It makes no sense. It makes no sense to be fighting in court right now to try to take away Obamacare from people who need it more than ever. It makes no sense not to open up a new enrollment period in the middle of this pandemic so that people who need insurance can get it now. As we look at the next steps that are needed, we should boost the subsidies for Obamacare, give them affordable coverage. The same goes for Cobra. You all know what Cobra subsidies are. When the president and I were in charge of pulling the country back from the great recession and rebuilding our economy in 2009, we made sure the subsidies were up to 65%. This crisis is going to be even bigger, so our support for the American people is going to need to be even more generous. By the way, Cobra kicks in when your insurance you have with your company no longer is available to you. The government should pick up the full cost of Cobra premiums right now. One additional tragedy of this crisis is how much pain could have been avoided with swift decision action and decisive action. This is a challenge that requires leadership. It requires transparency and it requires urgency. America's longterm recovery is going to require far more investment, but it needs to be smart and effective. We can't just return to an unfair, unequal economy that's stacked against American workers. We already know we're going to need more resources, a lot more. More people are going to need help. Let's start now so we don't waste valuable time. Let's get help to the people who need it the most. I know that we'll come through this challenge stronger than ever, just as we have every crisis we've ever faced in this nation. There's nothing Americans can't achieve when we do it together. I'm anxious to hear your questions, but I tell you what, I promise you we will get through this. You've heard me talk about the soul of America, Senator, and I talk about we need to restore it. We're seeing the soul of America and all the workers I'm going to be talking to today, all the people all across the country, they're not asking whether you're a Muslim or a Christian. They're not asking whether you're a Latino or you're not. Whenever you need, people reaching out. Look at all of first responders, how they're risking their lives without the equipment they need to help people. It makes me proud to be an American, proud. It really does. This is the soul of America. We're seeing it now. As a consequence, when we get through this, we're going to be able to do so much better than we've done in the past. Let me stop now and take any questions you all may have. I'll leave it to you, Senator, how we go from here. Hey, Lavette, how are you? How are things up in Beantown? Good. Good. IBW. Sure. Fire away. Well, look, first of all, you're going to get through this kiddo. I know it's scary. I really do. I have a clear sense of it. I've been talking to an awful lot of workers all across the country, and so many people are in your shoes, Lovette. Over 10 million Americans have filed for unemployment claims during the last two weeks in March. It's likely that millions more have filed a claim sensitive and millions of families worry how they're going to make the rent, how they're going to pay the bills, how they're going to keep food on the table. We've never seen anything like this before in all of our history, including during the Great Depression. The recent bill that's called the Cares Act, that the Congress passed was a good step. For the average American, their employees should be kept on the payroll. That's that's the whole point of the legislation. Tell businesses, ""Keep the workers on the payroll."" For those who are not kept on the payroll, there's extended unemployment benefits with an added $600 per week, which means that if you're making under $75,000 a year, up to $75,000, you'd be made whole with whatever your salary is. We have to get those payments out the door fast and I was confident that they weren't going to know how to do this once this got passed. We got to get it on time and in full to make every family whole and it's a massive undertaking. Just look at the unemployment claims. As I said, almost 10 million in two weeks. That's several times the prior record, which is an awful record to be breaking. States need immediate help with staffing, technology and training to handle this tidal wave. If you go to the unemployment office in Boston, they're way over burdened and some laid off workers are waiting over a month to collect their unemployment checks. Now, a lot more needs to be done, a lot. I've called off for the President to one, issue clear guidelines so that all Americans understand the benefits they're entitled to. It's hard even to go to one place and know what the benefits you're entitled to are. Create an unemployment delivery team to help States get assistance out as quickly as possible, including boosting funding for the State staffs to be able to handle and get the information out federally and the States to be able to create and follow through. There's a thing called the Defense Production Act. You heard a lot about it because you heard me starting to call for the President to employ it a while ago. Defense Production Act allows the President as if it were a war to declare that he can take over the production of certain things. For example, remember how he dilly dallied, as my mother used to say, insisting that General Motors stop making cars and start to make ventilators? He finally ordered them to make the ventilators. Well, we have to make sure that in fact that Defense Production Act applies not only to getting people what they need to protect themselves, but we should have a Bank Defense Production Act. Let me make sure that you understand what I'm saying about that. We've got to make sure the banks, the big banks, are willing to provide for and deliver, make sure that there's unemployment payments are prioritized first and foremost and require the use of electronic payments that are invalid or able to be paid for electronically, your unemployment, prepaid debt cards for people without a bank account and deliver direct cash relief fast as we can get it. Family shouldn't have to wait for President Trump to sign a check. We have to work with Congress to extend and boost unemployment benefits. That is the extra $600 however long this crisis lasts, not just for the month, for however long this crisis last, so your unemployment check will be there every month for the entire month for as long as this crisis lasts. Look, Congress has to start working on the fourth relief bill out there. We have to get more relief, including a freeze and a halt on foreclosures and evictions so people don't have to worry where they're going to be out in the street. We have to restart the economy. There's only one path forward, beat the virus, but let me hold for a second here and say one of the thing. There's a provision in the law that was passed that every person out there would get a direct payment through the IRS of a $1,200 payment beyond their health insurance, excuse me, beyond their unemployment insurance. If you have a child, you get an extra $500. The IRS should have already set up and get to you, for example, a check for $1,700, direct cash payment for every American out there so they can get through this very difficult period. For a while, Trump was talking as if we had to choose between our public health and our economy, but they're inextricably linked. This virus is why we have an economic crisis and no amount of economic relief will matter if we don't bend, you hear a lot about the inflection curve, how we got to bend that curve. Instead of going up and up and up has got to come down and flatten out. We have to do that as quickly as possible to stop the spread and save lives. That's priority number one. The two things that we have to make sure you have a place to go to is when you go to your employment office, they're able to pay you what you are entitled under the law and it's an added $600 bonus from whatever the state had was going to pay before, essentially rendering you whole up to $75,000 and I know that's not what you're making right now. I assume that's not what you're making now, but up to that amount of money and the direct cash payment that we sent to you in the mail to your address that the Congress voted for through the IRS. There are the things we have to do and we got to get them to now. in addition, this next time around, this next bill, they're going to have to pass, We're already talking about it as they also have to continue this As long as the crisis continues. the cash payments have to continue and the unemployment benefits and the offices need help in all the States getting up and running. Thank you. Hope that answers your question. I'm glad you got You're willing to speak with me and look, I know you're worried about taking care of your son. I Know you're worried about when the next meal is on the table and I know your work and a lot of people are all over the country. Thank you. By the way, you know what we're realizing with all this crisis? How valuable, how valuable unions are, how valuable it is that we have an IBW, that we have people who in fact are first responders. How valuable the people we didn't look to before and didn't say, ""Thank you,"" for. This is this is going to workout for the best at the end because people now realize how valuable it is. If every electrician in America went on strike, America shuts down. Okay. If every every janitor walks out, guess what? The disease in fact gets worse. We have to appreciate that people who are busting their neck, they're the ones that built this country. They're the ones that keep it going and I think there's a new appreciation for just what's being done by so many good people. Thank you. It's going to be very hard. Look, as I said, the President makes it sound like there's a false choice. We either deal with the virus or we deal with unemployment and the economy. If you don't deal with the virus first, you're never going to get back to be able to have the kind of robust economy we need and get people taken care of. The first thing we have to do is make sure people are financially taken care of because their circumstances they're in, whether they're small businesses, they're employees, whatever it is, is through no fault of their own. That's a Government responsibility to keep them whole, as whole as we can do it and that's got to come right out of the treasury and get paid for. Now on the issue of the virus, whoever asks, who has the question is this, it doesn't matter, but whoever asked the question, you got it right. Until we have a vaccine, we're not going to be totally out of the woods. In the meantime though, what we have to do is significantly increase, significantly increase the number of tests that are available, the testing kits that are available and all the protective gear that's available so doctors and nurses can deal with this pandemic in a way where we don't lose them, that they're able to take care of our health. That's why, again, going back to this Defense Production Act. I think the President should be taking over certain industries. We are going to do nothing but make another 30 million masks. You're going to do nothing but make sure that the docs and nurses have the masks they need, that they have the gloves they need. You have nurses going into an operating room and into an ICU wearing garbage bags over them to try to protect. They need the protective gear, the goggles, the whole works, and so that should be priority number one. There is some real experimentation going on in terms of whether or not you can identify those people who have had the virus, didn't know it and find out they're immune knew it and they have an immune system that in fact would allow them to go back to work, even when the virus is not completely contained because they have an antibody. Those tests are now trying to be developed and they're trying to develop tests where you can drive through and know in 5 to 15 minutes exactly whether you have the virus or not so we can trace people and determine who they've been in contact with or they had the virus. That has to be significantly, significantly, significantly increased and remember they were talking about they're going to be doing 4 million tests today, about two weeks ago. Well, we're not there yet because we have to indicate to whatever industry has the capacity to make this material, do these tests, put them together. They have to be done now as rapidly as possible and the prisoners should act. Hey, Judy. How are you? Well, first of all, Judy, what you're doing, speaking up now not really mean it. It makes a big difference. Your Governor's working like the devil to make sure that he's able to have a staffed up unemployment office and he's making sure that so many things is trying to get done. He shouldn't have to compete with other States and the Federal Government to find out that they can't get the material that they need to make themselves in the workplace, that they're in a position where your colleagues are carrying the weight of the world on their backs. You're the lifeline to people in moments of these kinds of moments when we're fighting like hell to protect health, safety, families and I want to thank you for that. Look, there's that's always been true, but now there's not a single person in this country who doesn't know the heroic efforts so many people are making every single day and it's past time we had your backs and here's the deal. We're in a position now where if in fact when you say, ""What can we do?"" We can make sure that the legislation that's already been passed has the capacity to be distributed and there is, now, so far what we need essentially is the administration to have a place where you can go to one person, one place. How do we get the benefit, this benefit or that benefit? We start by getting immediate help to do your job in this trying time. Look. First, we need to make sure that you're getting personal protective equipment, conditions that are needed for safety. I've called on President Trump, as I said, to employ that Defense Production Act, ensure every single front line worker has PPE and I'd also direct OSHA to deal with the state safety and health agencies to ensure that they have workplace policies. But what is it, what bothers you the most? What is the thing that concerns you the most about where you are right now and what your role working for the state is? Well, look, there's a couple things. The Federal Government passed a lot of money for small businesses to keep them alive and well, to keep them going. The problem is it's awful hard to figure how that small business gets that loan from the bank because the banks haven't wanted -- the big banks don't like lending to small businesses. For example, Bank of America, which the American taxpayers bailed out last time around in a crisis. Well, they're saying, unless you already have an account with us, unless you have a credit card with us, we're not going to process a loan even though the Federal Government's going to guarantee the loan that you have, guarantee you have it. So we should have an oversight on that to make sure the banks are held accountable, that they get out these small business loans. They are guaranteed by the Federal Government. We also should be doing things like making sure that the whole idea of the $500 billion for big companies wasn't for them to be able to have stock buy backs or be able to move in a direction where they were able to reward their shareholders or their CEOs. It was to keep people employed on the payroll. And so we need to get the resources to the enforcers to know exactly what's being done and what's not being done. I urge the Federal Government to create an unemployment insurance delivery team with funding for extra staffing and server capacity to help States manage the crush of these claims. And in the Senate, Democrats have also opposed hazard pay for essential workers, a boost in paychecks that reflect the risk on a frontline workers are taking, I support extending any hazard pay congress provides the public sector workers in essential jobs. In order to make sure that they're meaningful, we've got to get a lot more funding to the States. The States don't have enough funding and they're now pinched between plummeting tax revenues that they're not collecting and soaring emergency response costs and to avoid painful damaging cuts in public services. So we can't let the public sector workers risk losing pay. Instead, we have to encourage the privatization of the public sector as President Trump has done, that's not what we should be doing. We need to boost support for state and local governments who are always and make sure that we're going to have their backs and it means fighting, I would argue, for unions to make sure public sector employees have a voice in the workplace that they deserve. So there's so much that the President -- as President, I'll pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act and make it a Federal right for all public sector employees to be able to organize and collectively bargain so someone who serves our communities has a voice on the job. My point is we have to give the States significantly more help. We have to have essentially a person in command who is able to distribute all that's needed to these States, right, answering directly to the President of United States and I don't think that's being done now. He is. He's very limited and that's why he shouldn't have to compete with other States to figure out whether he can find protective gear for his first responders or his doctors or his nurses or the hospitals that are in trouble, et cetera. That's a Federal responsibility. Well, it's going to take a while to get it back on track and it's not going to get back on track until we get the virus under control. So social distancing is going to be required for some time, number one. Number two, that's why it's so urgent to do two things that could speed that up considerably. One, we should be working, as I think we are now, with the international community, not just our doctors and scientists, to find a vaccine. To find a vaccine. In the meantime, we also have the opportunity to do a great deal more in providing millions and millions of tests that you can get a result from those tests in five to seven minutes. So you know whether or not you've had the virus, but you're well, you don't have the virus, or you have the virus. That all sends you in different directions. If you've had the virus and you are well, it means you have an antibody in your system. They're trying to develop how you can develop those antibodies that can be applicable to other people to prevent them from getting the disease, or allowing you to go back to work because you don't have to social distance because you're not a carrier, you're immune, and as well as you're not likely to get the disease from someone else. We also have to work really hard, really hard to make sure in the meantime, in the meantime, everybody is held harmless. This is not anybody's fault. This is not anybody's fault. It's nothing they did for this to happen and so we have to do is provide for the ability for you to be able to stay in your home, get unemployment insurance, get a direct payment from the Federal Government so you can sustain yourself and your children in this period of real crisis. And it also means making sure that everybody understands in this next bill that gets passed that any costs relating to the coronavirus in terms of testing or healthcare is free. You don't have to pay anything for it. Period. Three things. First of all, I think for those who are not union members and don't have health insurance, that we should open up Obamacare and allow them to become part of Obamacare instead of being in court like the President is, trying to get rid of it. That's number one. Laid off workers, you have fought and bargained, and those of you who are with Unite Here, you bargain hard for quality health insurance and you shouldn't lose it, least of all now. And as I'm partially repeating myself, but the first thing I would do for all workers is make sure COVID-19 treatment is cost-free. Period. Whatever treatment is associated with it. No one should have to pay a dollar out of pocket for that. I called for that on March the 12th and it should be part of the next congressional package that hadn't passed yet. The next thing I would do is help laid off union members, ensure they keep their union health insurance through COBRA, the COBRA program. When we went through the last crisis, economic crisis, Barack and I made sure that 65% of all the COBRA payments were paid for by the Federal Government. It's a fancy way of saying COBRA allows you to keep your Unite Here insurance plan, even if your company can't continue to provide it. And you probably know, but for the folks at home who may not, COBRA is a program where if you lose your job, you can pay to stay on your same insurance plan you had when you were working for the company you were working with. The problem is it's really expensive. If you have to pay multiple times more for your existing premium for the same plan you had before you were laid off because your employer no longer is making contributions toward it, that premium is pretty high. So I believe the Federal Government should be the one offering the subsidies to you to cover most of all the CORBRA premium so that for example, in 2009, I'm repeating myself, our administration picked up 65% of the family cost to keep your existing insurance program under the COBRA program. Given the nature of this crisis, I'm calling on the Trump administration and Congress to pick up the full cost of the premiums right now. Congress should include this in this new phase four legislation. The bottom line means for all those union members who are worried about whether their employer will keep funding the health care plans, I would protect them. Union members have fought hard for their health insurance and I put forward back on March the 12th that I commit to ensuring that the Taft-Hartley benefit funds have the financial resources so that they can continue to keep those programs going in the company, the outfit you work for. And finally for all workers, in addition to the COBRA subsidies I'd provide enhanced subsidies to make sure that the Affordable Care Act priorities are more meaningful so that lower-income and middle class folks have less cost sharing and more affordable health care so that they don't have to increase their premiums. Meanwhile, I've been calling on the Trump administration to stop fighting in the courts to try to gut the law and get rid of Obamacare. Now I realize they're two different things. You're not talking about Obamacare. You're talking being able to keep your really well-funded, you've given up an awful lot and pay over the years to make sure you have a really good healthcare plan through your employer. Again, let's get straight. I know this is complicated. The COBRA program says that that's what it's for. It allows you to keep your existing plan and will be paid for, the one you have through Unite Here, and the Federal Government will pay the 100% of that premium. You wouldn't have to pay a thing. You continue to get the plan and it's cost-free to you. The one you have now, no additional premium to you as long as this crisis lasts. Does that answer the question? You sure? It's okay if it hadn't. I'll try -- it's complicated, but in one sense it shouldn't be complicated. You or the outfit you work for did nothing through their fault to cause that insurance to not be able to be funded. That's why we set up the COBRA plan years ago to begin with. It's 100%, but it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by the President this go round for the next tranche of money that's going in to make sure people are kept whole. Okay. Probably too thorough. I apologize, but I think, look, as you and I've talked about this, Senator, I'm always talked about as being a foreign policy expert. Health care's more complicated than foreign policy. Healthcare is complicated and it really is daunting for an awful lot of people, and so that's why maybe I over explained. I'm sure she understood, but I think it's really important that they not lose the insurance they have now, as long as this crisis is in fact underway, and -- they shouldn't have to pay to keep it Well, by the way, Nancy Pelosi feels strongly about this. An awful lot of Democrats in the Congress are pushing it. It's just going to be a little uphill fight with our Republican friends. Well, I'll be very brief. Look, I know I'm occasionally called a congenital optimist, but I think I'm a student of history. Out of every real serious crisis the country's faced, we've lost a lot, people have suffered a lot, but they've come through it, and we've ended up better for it. Out of the Great Depression, we ended up with everything from the Fair Labor Standards Act to Social Security, a whole range of things. We were better off for it. Ordinary people were better off. Now what people are seeing, they took for granted so many of the functions the people that you represent provide, so many things they do. They just took it for granted, and now they're realizing that person stocking the shelf in the grocery store every day in the middle of this crisis is risking themselves. Jill, my wife Jill, who you know well, Jill did an event earlier today with what used to be called the Janitors' Union. They're beyond that now. They're the people after everything that goes on in a crisis, everything that goes on that is being done, whether it's a warehouse or an operating room, they go in and sanitize it, and they're going in to sanitize it without all the equipment they need. They're putting themselves at risk for it. People are understanding that the reason this country is who they are is because of ordinary people, like the folks I come from, and you come from, and most Americans do. They're the ones that make it work, and they're beginning to realize we owe them. We owe them a much better circumstance. Let me conclude with one other thing. This millennial generation, of which you're a part, has gone through a hell of a circumstance over the last 15 years. They ended up in a situation where we had, because of the financial crisis and the previous administration before us, they ended up in a situation where they're behind the eight ball. They in fact had to borrow enormous amounts of money to go to school. They had to put themselves in a position where they started off in debt, where they weren't able to buy a home. They weren't able to go out and buy a car because of the debt they inherited, because of what happened with everything from the [Inaudible] anyway, because of viruses, because of the concern we had with the financial collapse. And a lot of them lost a lot in the meantime. In the meantime, now you have this so-called new generation, the Z generation, coming along, and they're missing out on so much. I don't think it has to be explained anymore. They're not having their graduation parties. They're not having their prom. They're not having commencement. They're having to give up an awful lot of things, an awful lot of things, and they're being put further behind the eight ball. They're going to start off at a slower pace in terms of jobs available to them. They're going to start off in ways that they're going to be behind the eight ball. That's why we have to look at them now. They're not whining. They're just out there saying, hey, look, I busted my neck. That's why the next bill should forgive a minimum of $10,000 of student debt for everybody with a debt when they pass this bill, just right off the bat, keep them in a position so when we come out of this, they're not further in the hole, that they're not so deep in the hole that they've been put into. The other thing is we have to take care of seniors better. We should be increasing Social Security payments now. They're struggling. They're having real problems now. We should be increasing Social Security payments across the board, $200 for everybody, besides reforming the system down the road to make it more applicable and more generous. There's things we should be doing now, so when we come out of this, people aren't in a deeper hole than they were to begin with. I have a lot more to say, but I've said too much. I get too passionate about it, but I promise you, Senator, we can get through this. As you've heard me say before, Wall Street didn't build this country. Ordinary, hard working people built this country. Given half a chance, they have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. Never once, never once. And that's how we build the middle class. You built the middle class. Unions like yours built the middle class. That's why we're where we are. I think people are realizing it now, so I think we're going to be in much better shape when we get through this to have the kind of structural change we need to make it better for everybody, because when the hard working person with a high school education, which is not you, you're beyond that, but with a high school education, breaking their neck, all of a sudden people are saying, ""I couldn't make it without that person."" We've got to treat them better. They deserve a better wage. They deserve to be treated with decency. They deserve to be thanked. They're the ones doing God's work here. Cops, firefighters, and nurses and doctors, first responders. I mean, ambulance drivers. I mean, we just owe them so much and they deserve not just our thanks. They deserve that they should be paid what they deserve and treated with dignity. Anyway, thank you very much, Senator. I appreciate it. I'm looking forward to seeing you soon, I hope. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"Well thanks for having me. I'm particularly, um, happy to be here, because this generation that's represented, uh, I am, make me incredibly optimistic. I know we're gonna talk about a lot of different issues, but the optimism that I have is borne out of a long experience of holding public office. You're the single most educated generation in American history, not a joke. You're the single most engaged generation in American history. You're the single most generous generation in American history. And you're also the single most... uh, how can I say it? Um... uh... open, and least prejudiced generation in American history. And to think of the subject we're gonna be talking about today, they, they couldn't even be talked about 30 years ago. I mean, literally, many of them would not even be discussed. And so I just want to thank you for letting me be here, and I'm anxious to... hear what's on your mind, and maybe get to ask you guys some questions too as we go along, so- But, thank you. Let me say, in full disclosure, I spent a lot of time in the school that this all happened. I met for with every single parent who lost someone, and I've become friends with their dad. So, full disclosure. And, I remember her when she was about as big as you saw in the film with her brother. And, um, it was a, a circumstance that, uh, was... I visited every mass shooting site that has occurred in all, a number of years, going all the way back to your school. And, one of the things that I saw was that, actually three things. One, you know, I did get the law changed, uh, uh, banning assault weapons back in the, in the, in '92 or 3, and, uh, but, I had, it can only do it for an X number of years. Had to come up for reconsideration, and when it came up for reconsideration in the Bush administration, they did not let it... They let it go. They wouldn't support it. And, uh, I've been trying to get it changed since then, but here's the deal. One of the things that occurs, there's two things, I think, what happened in your school. One was that, that was the mom who had all those weapons, his mother, and, uh, he had access to them. Right now, folks, if I left, if I, we were at a, this were not at the White House, we were at a, at a restaurant, and I left the keys in my automobile, and some underage kid came out, stole the automobile, was driving, and killed someone, I'd be liable. I'd be civilly liable, because I was irresponsible, leaving the kids in the car. I think anyone who owns weapons, any weapon, should have to lock them up, if they're legal weapons, lock them up. I have, I haven't shot them in a long time, but I have two shotguns. My deceased son had a shotgun. We used to have target practice. But, the fact of the matter is, they're locked in a case, so, no one should be able to access those, number one. No, I, I don't think that the AR, the, these assault weapons are just that. They're made for one reason, to kill people, as when I was trying to get it passed the first time and got it passed, hunters in Delaware would say, ""Well, I want ..."" I said, ""How many deer are wearing Kevlar vest? How many folk, how many folks out there are there? What purpose is it to have a gun that can, a bullet can travel five times the speed of an ordinary bullet?"" So, what we did was, this time around, we finally, and first time in 30 years, got gun legislation passed, and the House of Representatives, at my encouragement and of their own, passed the assault weapon ban, but the Republicans in the Senate blocked it. I, we only had 50 votes. We have to get every single Democrat, and we were not able to get it done. And, but, I promise you, I promise you that this next term, this next two years, I'm going to do everything in my power. The American people support doing away with those weapons. And honey, and I shouldn't say honey. I remember when you were little, but, you know, you know the tragedy that occurred, and what maybe you don't know is, folks, after what happened at her school, the state police has to meet with me, the state police who are doing the investigation. There are about 15 of them, and we went in a, in a room, and some of them started crying, and they said, ""We need help."" They were talking about, they needed mental help. What they saw, this carnage that this, this young man inflicted on that whole school, and on the teachers, as well. And so, it's just, I find no rational reason why assault weapons should be able to be sold, period. And, I promise, I'm going to do it. I'm going to go right at it again when we go back, when they go back in session. But, your voice matters, by the way. I, I genuinely mean it. And, I promise you, I made it a priority from the beginning, but you got to vote. Vote, vote, vote, vote. We need a couple more Democrats in the Senate. I'm not being facetious when I say this. People voting, showing up to vote. For example, the idea that you could sell, my, my, my legislation says there can be no more than eight bullets in a round, okay? What these guys do in these mass killings, they have, they have magazines, they call them, as I know you know, that can hold up to 100 bullets in it. 100 bullets. That's where these ma -- I mean, people just, it's like having a automatic weapon, which is, we're not allowed to have, by the way, supposedly. And, uh, and so, it limits the size of the magazines. It limits the ability of any, any weapon, any weapon, including pistols, and it limits the use of the sale of an assault weapon, period, across the board. So, it's, it does both, and, uh, there's just... And, by the way, for every mass shooting that you read about, like it happened at her school, for every single one of those, there's a mass shooting taking place every day in a neighborhood, in a neighborhood. You know, you got 4,000 of these things, but, I mean, and they never get mentioned. People walk into a school, but in tough neighborhoods, there's mass shootings every single day, every single day, and it's wrong. It's just simply wrong. I used to have a good friend I went to high school with, and I'd say, ""Bob, do you understand me?"" He'd say, ""Joe, I not only understand you, I overstand you."" I overstand. I got into a... private university when I was out of high school, and even with the financial aid I couldn't go there. And I had to work, which is not a problem, to go to the University of Delaware, which is much, much cheaper. Now, just in the last 40 years, the four year university has, the cost of a four year university has tripled. Tripled, in the last 40 years, to go to the school to begin with. And, uh, Pell Grants use to cover 80% of a college, uh, um, tuition. Now, it's down to about 30%. And thirdly, what's happened is, the states for state-run universities, like University of Delaware, the University of Michigan, state universities, in fact, they've cut back significantly on what the state contributes to... going... the cost of the education. And all three are a gigantic problem, and it leaves a lot of people like you and, uh, and my family, before I was elected to the United States senate, in considerable debt. If you go to a private university, um, it's, you know, I had a son who passed away who was a... an Attorney General of the state of Delaware. He was still on, still paying off his debt. You go to a private university like where my son went, and I went to a great university, Delaware, they went to Yale and they went to, uh, you know, Penn. I'm joking, obviously, but you know what it cost? It cost $85,000 a year to go. How do you do that? And so my point is that we have to do three things, in my view. Number one: point out that universities, in many cases, are raising tuitions without any good reason to raise that, raise, raise those tuitions. Secondly, we've got to encourage state legislative bodies to say, ""Contribute more to second, to, uh, college education as a profession to allow the state university to be run. So what I've done, I've provided a lot of money, particularly for HBCUs, Black universities and minority-serving industries, um, we're investing I think it's a total of roughly $40 billion dollars. Um... you know, overall, for education overall. And the other piece, what we're trying to do, is you're probably aware, I've just signed a law that's being challenged by my Republican colleagues, those same people that got PPP loans during the, for, up close to, in some cases up to five, six hundred thousand dollars, they have no problem with that. The individuals in Congress got those. But, um, what we've provided for is, if you went to school, if you qualify for a Pell Grant, you're qualified for two thou-, um, excuse me, you, you qualify for $20,000 in debt forgiveness. Secondly, if you don't have one of those loans, you just get 10,000 written off. It's passed, I got it passed by a vote or two, and it's in effect. And already a total of I think it's now 13 million people have applied for that service. And, uh... you know, what I think we should be doing as well is, right now there's a payment program that you never have to pay back more than ten percent of your disposable income for your colle-... I think that should be cut to five percent, and I think that should be kept. And I've proposed that, that's passed, and so on. So anyway, there's a lot of things, but the biggest thing we can do also is to help, uh, with Pell Grants, and I want to double the Pell Grants, the size of the Pell Grants, so we begin to bring this back into some kind of equilibrium again. There's a lot more to say but I probably already said too much. If you want to ask me anything else, please. Well hopefully there's not going to be a new administration that's going to change in the next, uh, six years. It's about... making it clear... look, they talk about the cost of this. Well, at the same time that people are criticizing the cost of this, the same people who voted for a two trillion dollar tax cut for the very wealthy in corporate America. We did a couple things to pay for this. One, I was able to cut the federal debt my first year by 350 billion dollars. This year, the federal debt is gonna be cut in the fiscal year by one trillion dollars. And when we passed the inflation reduction act, which allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices so they're fair, we pay the highest drug prices of any country in the world, any major country, that's gonna create a 30 billion dollar cut over the next ten years. And so... I mean, 300 billion. And so the point is, we can afford this. We can afford this. And one of the things we did in order to pay for a lot of these things is we thought it's about time that some of the super wealthy corporations begin to pay their fair share. For example, in the year 2020, the year I got elected, the fact is that of the... 54, I believe, maybe 53 of the Fortune 500 companies that made 40 billion dollars, paid zero. Zero. Zero in federal taxes. Now I got it passed by a single vote, they're gonna pay 15%. And that's raising the money to be able to pay for things that are needed. And think about it. What's the single most consequential thing we could do in America, dealing with America's progress in the future? Education. And does anybody think if we were sitting down like we did in the beginning of the last century, and deciding how we're gonna move America along to be the most progressive nation in the world, we were the only nation that had 12 years of free education. Well, does anybody think 12 years is enough in the second quarter of the 21st century? Not a joke. I don't think we'd ever think that was enough. So at a minimum, we should be making sure that we have access, and I think free and reduced access, to community college and early education at three years of age. I pushed it, I haven't gotten it passed yet. And so there's a lot of things that we can do to increase the prospects of, of, uh, being able to have a better educated public where you're not indebted and have sort of a... a weight around your neck for a long, long time. God love you. I don't think any state or anybody should have the right to do that. As a moral question and as a legal question, I just think it's wrong. You know, I think I was saying before we started that my son, my deceased son, used to be the Attorney General of the state of Delaware. He passed the f -- most -- the broadest piece of legislation that he as Attorney General can, uh, was able to convince the legislator and the Governor to sign that dealt with, uh, all gender affirming capab -- I mean, there's a lot of, you know, you -- sometimes they try to block you from being able to access certain medicines, being able to access certain procedures, and so on. None of that should be available. I mean, uh, you know, no -- no state should be able to do that in my view, so I feel very, very strongly that, uh, that you should have every single solitary right, including -- including use of -- th -- your gender identity bathrooms in public. More than any other group of people. I'm not being facetious when I say this, being seen with people like you. No, I mean it. I genuinely mean it. People fear what they don't know. They fear what they don't know. And when people realize, individuals realize, ""Oh, this is what they're telling me to be frightened of, this is the problem, this is...."" I mean, people change their minds. People are just don't know enough to know. L -- and it's not because of I -- I -- intellectual incapability, it's just lack of exposure. And, uh, I think that, uh, it's really important that we continue to speak out about the basic fundamental rights of all human beings, and the idea, the idea that what's going in, you know, in some states, I won't get into any politics of it, but in some states, it's just -- it's outrageous, and I think it's immoral. The trans parts not immoral, uh, what they're trying to do trans persons is immoral. Yeah, I do. Um, this is blood of your blood, bone of your bone. And, uh, um, it is, uh, a -- again speaking to my son, when he was -- he was -- spent a year in Iraq, and he was a decorated solider. He volunteered to go as a -- he had to give up the Attorney Generals job, then came back to it. And, uh, he started a -- a -- a -- foundation, I'm not allowed to talk about it now because I can't raise money for it any longer, but it was abused children. And one of the things he did is raise millions of dollars, this organization, to basically educate parents as to what they should not be afraid of, um, and to educate the community as to what is -- wh -- what is just pure hyperbole. And -- and, uh, so I just think it's a matter of leaders speaking out, and, uh, and saying, as I told you, I mentioned a young woman used to on the staff, used to be on my staff, um, who is now a state senator a -- a number -- and she's trans, and she's a -- a, you know, a state senator in the state of Delaware in a area that was historically very conservative, the part of the Delaware. And she, uh, she's running unopposed this time. Um, so things are changing. Things are changing, but it's a matter of us acknowledging that there's nothing to be... Just because it's different, there's nothing to be fearful about. Well, first of all, um, it's the first time the Supreme Court has in fact, uh, made a lot of decisions, but it's the first time they've not only not proclaimed a constitutional right, but one that they acknowledge existed taking away, and it goes beyond... It goes beyond potentially the right to choose. Um, what I have done is, by executive order, when I am able, I don't have the votes, but by executive order, what I've been able to do so far, and that is, for example, making sure that a woman seeking to choose getting healthcare across a state line that permits abortion, that, in fact, from one that doesn't, like Texas to another state, that they are able to do that. They can't be held accountable for crossing the line. Making sure that you cannot, uh, making sure that women who are being looked at as to whether they might seek an abortion, that they're, that they're not able to be followed on their, on their accounts, so that they can know where they're going, making sure that there's access to, um, uh, a number of items that accommodate availability, OB/GYN help for the health of the mother, in, um, the states that still permit choice, uh, under Roe. Um, and so, there's a lot of things that I can do by executive order, but when I said the, and when you heard me say that the first bill I will send, if you give me the votes I need, a couple more senators, and I need to maintain the House, the House will vote. The House of Representatives will vote to codify Roe v. Wade, because, you know, senators, uh, uh, have on the Republican side made it clear. The first thing they want to do, Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina wants to federally pass a law that, uh, they'd expect the president sign that would, in fact, outlaw the right to choose and f -- in most cases, no matter whether it's incest, the pregnancy consequence of incest, or rape, or, or a -- any criminal act. And, and he wants to codify that so that you can't have these choice in any state. Um, I think if I have a few more votes, I'm going to be able to do that, and get the Democratic Congress to pass this, and I will sign it. But, if they somehow, we don't do that, and the Republicans succeed in blocking abortion in every state by passing a federal ban on it, then I'm going to veto it. It's not going to happen as long as I'm president. It's being contested in the courts, but I've passed an executive order saying that you can't do that, where the health of the, of the mother is in question, whether, for example, you know, some pregnancies are not able to be terminated where the parent wants to keep the child, that it's too dangerous to go- ...and ends up with a miscarriage. And so, what we have to do is just make the case to the American people, and I don't think it's... Look, the Supreme Court ruling said, and I'm paraphrasing the line in the court, saying that because this is a state issue, not federally guaranteed, wo -- wo -- women can vote. Facetiously, women can vote. Let's see. Well, guess what? I'm counting on you voting in big, big numbers, like happened in Kansas. Kansas overwhelmingly turned out, a very conservative state, saying, ""No, no, no, no. We're not going along with that law that's bans abortion, and bans it under any circumstance."" The other thing that worries me, two things, one you said, and one you didn't say. How many universities around the country are like the University, did you go to West, is it West Texas, or did you go to U, what was the unive- Okay, I won't mention it then, but how many have that same rule, where they don't teach you, OB/GYN, about the he -- health and safety relative to pregnancy? I didn't realize that was the case. I'm going to check it out in most states, um, and, uh, because it's very worrisome, and it's an example of what the Dobbs decision is doing. The Dobbs decision is putting an incredible amount of pressure on doctors to not take and make judgments that really do affect the mother, unrelated to whether or not it's really related to abortion. For example, the case of a 14-year-old girl trying to get access to, uh, um, medicine relating to rheumatoid arthritis. Um, it's, and, and she goes, and for years been getting it, her mom buying it, go to the counter, drugstore said, ""I, I, I can't sell it to you. I'm,"" because they're worried they'll be sued. They're worried they'll be sued. There's a lot of unintended consequences, as well, to this Dobbs decision. And so, I, I admire the hell, heck out of you for being willing to get together with other students and teach yourself. I mean, ho -- ho -- how, I'm curious, how'd you do that? But, who was teaching the practice? Gotcha. God love you. Absolutely. That answer's absolutely, but guess what? We need the same votes we need to overrule Do -- to, uh, reinstate, uh, the, uh, the decision that was struck down by the court. I mean, I do support that, and I've urged, publicly urged companies to do that. I've urged them publicly, as President of the United States, saying, ""This is what you should be doing. I urge you to do it,"" because there's so mu -- And imagine the women who need that kind of assistance, but have no money at all to be able to do this. None. How, how do, wh -- what do they do? They don't, they don't have the option. Our, uh, our success relative to the rest of the world, in terms of the number of mothers who die in pregnancy, and our, is, is so high, especially among the poor in our country. I, I, anyway... Thank you. Well, first of all, on behalf of all society, I apologize for it. I mean, 23 years- -- my God. I got stopped when I was a young senator trying to see Nelson Mandela in South Africa. Afterwards, he heard I... when he got released, he heard, he came to see me in Washington, and he walked up to me. He said, ""Thank you."" And I said... I looked at him, I said, ""How can you not hate?"" He was then president of the country. How can he not hate? He said the most incredible thing to me, he said, ""The jailers were just doing their job, just doing what they were paid to do."" And as I left, they said, ""Good luck, Nelson."" I can imagine you not having such... Anyway, I just... I -- I admire the hell out of you. Number one. Number two, you know, I don't think... I know you can't set a standard for clemency. You can't write a law saying, under these circumstances, and the chief executive authority to clemency like the governor did for you, or that I've just done for everyone who's ever been convicted of the possession of marijuana and/or, and/or smoking marijuana, uh, from... I can only do it in the federal prisons, for example. So I've changed the lives of thousands of people because, you know as well as I do, unless you're able to achieve the status you've -- you've achieved, even after you're released, what -- what do you do? Who... You know, you still go around with this stigma. In many cases, you can't, you can't apply for housing, you can't get [inaudible 00:04:28], you can't... and so on. And so what I've done, and I've had the Justice Department and the Department of Labor do, is go in and take a look at... While someone's in prison, for example, did you have access to education in prison? Yeah. Every single prison... Many prisons don't have any access. Every single one should have access to teaching a trade, and/or educating, or ge -- getting a degree. And when you are released from prison after serving your time, even those people are totally guilty. Right now there... In the past, they've been given 25 bucks and a, and a, and a bus ticket. They end up under the same bridge that -- that caused them to be arrested in the first place. So anybody... This is what I'm, we're -- we're doing in federally. Anybody who has committed a crime should have access to education in prison, in prison. If they're in there for a drug offense, they should have drug treatment. And that should not be... If that's the only crime, it should be mandatory drug treatment, not prison. We should also be in a situation where anyone who is released from prison has access to Pell Grants, to education, to public housing, to all the things that are out there that are available to everybody else, because what's the thing we wanna do? Give people a second chance. And you're -- you're -- you're -- you're providing society with a second chance. It's not like because you didn't do anything in the first place. But the point is it should be written into the law, which we're doing in the Justice Department, as well as the, as the, uh, the, uh, the Department of Labor, that people have access to education, access to opportunity, and access to everything that's available for any other citizen, any other citizen if you've done your time. Otherwise... And I point out to people who come after me for saying that. Is I say, ""Look, what do you want? You want a safer community or do you wanna release someone who already was in there because they had a bad background and environment, and they probably didn't have this access? Or do you wanna condemn them for the rest of their lives and make sure that society is damaged as a consequence?"" So it not only makes sense for the individual being released from prison, it makes sense for society. Society. And lastly, I don't think for most non-violent crimes there should be lo -- long prison sentences. I don't think it -- it should be a circumstance where you're denied the opportunity to make up for... And so probation should be a much broader application for non-violent crimes in most cases. There's some non-violent crimes that are horrendous, but... So the whole idea is how do we reduce violence and crime in America, and at the same time, do it in a way that is also fair to giving people a second chance? Yeah, sure. Um, that's what I've done, but tell me what you think. I mean, what do you think we should be doing? I know. Absolutely. Everything you just said, I've already done federally, federally. Everything. And here's the deal. One of the things... One of the reasons I'm against capital punishment is, you know, we have confirmed there's at least 195 cases since 1972 that the person who was convicted and about to put to death was innocent. Flat innocent, never committed the crime. Like in your case, you never committed the crime. DNA's helping change some of that. There's some changes that are coming forward that make it easier. But everybody should in prison, in prison, should be able to have, graduate with a trade. Be able to come out with an associate degree. Be able to... When they come out, everyone in prison who's there for a major drug offense, they're addicted, they should be in mandatory drug treatment in prison. Mandatory in prison. And so what we're trying to do is change the dynamic of what makes society overall safer and what's more fair for the people who have been convicted rightly or wrongly. What's the, what's the wisest thing to do? And that's why the things you're talking to me about, and we have time, I can go through 'em, but we've done the vast majority of those by executive order in the federal prison system. I can't do it in the state prison system. What I'm doing in the state prison system is offering, excuse me, encouragement by providing federal assistance if they would do these things. But the idea that there is no access to anything other than to sit in a cell or walk the yard and not have anything to do and not, and better yourself- -- intellectually or mentally is a big mistake. Yeah. We'll talk afterwards Jon. Good to see you again, kiddo. I met you in Flint when you were eight years old. The message I sent was I was able to pass $360 billion, billion, to make sure that we start to deal with c -- climate crisis. And, in the infrastructure bill, it's confusing, in the, in the bill we passed for a $1,200 billion to fix our infrastructure. We're going to make sure that every single lead pipe in America is, which, is out. Too, we're gonna pay to have a new one put in, in all those hundreds of thousands of homes. And, what happened with you guys was, your city decided, in Flint, instead of going from a, taking the water from a Lake into the treatment plant, they took it from the Flint river, which was polluted. It was polluted. And, that, then, corroded the pipes and things, all, after they went to the devil from that point on. And, by the way, all those pipes are gone except you have 16% left in your state, and we're still, we're paying to make sure every single solitary lead pipe is done. No child should have to turn on the water in a fountain in the school and/or at home and worry about whether or not sh -- they're ingesting lead. And, there are even more chemicals that are more dangerous than that. Those forever chemicals. And they're in things like the foam used to clean runways and the like. And, what we're doing is changing that as well. You're not going to be able to use those chemicals. And, we're going to have to have different chemicals that are gonna be able to do the same job. And, so, the biggest thing is, though, that we have to change what we are, those things that are, affect the environment, because if we don't get it straight in the next, by 2050, if we go to, uh, 1.5 degrees, uh, uh, higher, in s -- I -- in temperature, we're going to be out of luck. There's nothing we can do to change what's going on. For example, Russia, just one example. They're in eight time zones, and all that permafrost around the arctic circle in that area. Guess what? The permafrost is melting. It will never freeze again. You know what's coming out? Methane, which is four times, four times as dangerous as CO2. Look what's happening, not only in Flint, but cities all across America, all across America in terms of clean water. In the sewer systems. The sewer systems are getting damaged, to fix them, I mean, the -- the -- the sew -- sewer treatment facilities that are being damaged have to be replaced. Their technology is 40, 50, 60 years old. Not much has been done. But, it cost billions of dollars to do it. So, that's why it was necessary to pass legislation, both, in both bills, that probably totaled at total of $500 billion to be spent now, now, to make sure your generation doesn't go through more Flints. And, so, that's, they're the things... There's much more to talk about. But, because of people like you, young people like you insisting this change take place, if you weren't out there hollering, I wouldn't be able to get any of this passed. Because, people are listening. And, by the way, I talked about the young vote, to begin with. It's not the... Now you're a very young vote and you're way ahead of your time. You're kind of a, uh, a progeny. You know? Uh, anyway. But, all kidding aside, the greatest concern and the greatest help that I get for my environmental stands are from young people, because you get it. You get what's happening. So, there's a lot we can do. And, by the way, we should be cleaning up the Great Lakes, overall. The Great Lakes are the single greatest source of water in the world, as one -- one source. Seriously, did you know that? More fresh water, drinking water in the Great Lakes than anywhere in the world. And, we rely heavily on it. But, we're everything from, for example, the fuel used in those -- those boats that transmit, that transfer material up and down the Great Lakes. Well, guess what? They're polluting the lakes; not all of them, but they're -- they're -- they're -- they're pollutants. The, for example, the cement that we make now, to lay down the cement. You can change it and reduce the, uh, the environ -- reduce harm to the environment, because making that cement causes a significant pollution of the, o -- o -- of the air. And, so, we're changing the way we make cement. The way we make steel. We can make steel better now, without having the negative impacts on the environmental impacts by the way we make the steel. So, and what we're trying to do is, once we get that done... I'm sorry, I feel... The way we get this done is, it's not sufficient that just the United States takes care of this. We have to help other countries take care of it as well, because it affects it's -- it's, you know, it's one atmosphere. It all goes into one atmosphere. So, what we're doing, as well, is we're rewarding farmers, for example, to plant crops that absorb carbon from the air, that absorb it, that suck it out of the air. For example, the Amazon, down in Brazil and other parts of South America, that absorbs, it's great, what they call a great carbon sink. It absorbs more carbon and pollution out of the atmosphere than is emitted by every single bit of negative thing we do in America on a daily basis. And, so, but guess what? We cut down all our forests, we did all these things to be economically viable. Now, they're coming along saying, ""How about us? How about us?"" So, we have to, the industrialized world, has to not only clean up our act, but we've got to help these countries do what they need to do, without further hurting the environment. And, we have to pay them, in my view, and to compensate them for what they're doing. And, so, there's a whole lot of things that we're doing. Last thing, I'll give you an example. You know all the electricity that's in here? It's transmitted over, there's a, there's a power station and that either burns coal or natural gas or oil in order to make, m -- m -- may generate the energy. And, it goes up on those big high tension wires and transmitted to wherever it needs to go. Well, guess what? Because of the research we did starting in the, in the administration, the last one I served in, the Obama Administration... The last one didn't do much. Didn't do anything, actually. Um, what happened was, that we made sure that we invested in how you can make solar cheaper and make sure that wind energy is a lot cheaper. And, so, but what happened was found out that people, even though we were able to do it much cheaper than a coal, than, you know, putting coal in a fire place to generate the energy to generate the electricity, it's a lot cheaper now to use wind and solar, than it is to use oil or -- or -- or coal. But, what happened was, you gotta be able to make sure you transmit it over those lines to get it places. But no one... ""Not in my neighborhood"". No one wants a new high tension stand going up in their neighborhood, or they don't want windmills that they can see. And President Trump was wrong. Windmills don't cause cancer, and they're, uh, and... But, here, I'll give you an example. I was in, in, uh, in, uh, Ohio. And, they have a experimental place that it's federal. You know, the blade of a windmill, you know, the -- the -- there's three blades in a windmill? They're now make them 104 yards long. Bigger than, longer than a football field. Longer than a football... And they generate enormous power, enormous power. So, what I've done is I've said you can't dig an oil well in certain parts off our shores in the Atlantic or in the Gulf, but you can put up these windmills. And, I was up in New England where the last major coal fired plant... They use coal to generate electricity. And, guess what? They want to go to wind or to solar energy and they want to do it, but, what they couldn't, now what we're doing is, ""Okay. We're gonna transfer what you're doing here and you're gonna use wind or solar. And we're gonna use the same high tension wires to transmit the energy."" And, so, we're gonna be able to clean the environment significantly, significantly. And, and one last thing. Battery technology. One of the things your g -- you're not gonna be driving a gas powered automobile. You're gonna be driving a -- a -- a -- a -- au -- au -- automobile that is an electric automobile. And, that's because we had in the back yard out here of the White House, we had all the three manufacturers come, the three major American manufacturers. And, they all committed. They're gonna go electric by 2035. That's gonna reduce expodentially, expodentially the impact on the environment. So, there's a lot of progress being made because folks like you hollered when you were eight years old, and now you're 29, I know. But, I'm joking. But, n -- n -- now you're getting up there. But, this is what we're gonna do. And, it's exciting. And the last thing I'll say, is it's gonna be, generate enormous economic growth. Remember, you may, you won't remember, kiddo. You may, you're so f -- f -- informed. But, when I was running, they said, ""Why isn't Biden talking about his -- his green plan now?"" This is in the beginning. Because, I wanted to make sure every labor union supported me, because they're all opposed to it until I sat down to talking with the IBEW, the electric u -- union, or br -- r -- br -- r -- the Brotherhood of Electric Workers. And I pointed out, their future lies in going electric. So, for example, we're gonna make sure that, tha -- you know, in gas stations on the interstates now? Well, guess what? There's gonna be electric re-charging stations. We're gonna have 500,000 of them. F -- I mean, fi -- fi -- fi -- fi -- 55,000 of them are gonna be put in. And, now, I'm sorry, I get too excited. Oh, let's hear your second question. Two things. One, if it's immediate, you mean I -- we find out tomorrow that there's this problem, we have to provide bottled water. That's a start. I mean, not, because you can't fix these pipes that go all the way back to the water station and go to toxic rivers, etc. Immediately. But, as I said, out in Flint. All, but 17% of all those, just as I've been in -- all those, all those lead pipes, they're out. They're out, they're gone now. But, you have 17% left. Now, granted, it's not 100%. But we're working diligently to get them all done; not only across America, we're providing billions of dollars to do this, directly to, not just the state, but to the locality. So, for example, Flint would get the money directly, to be able to get this done. They don't have to wait. They got a great governor who's pushing this really hard. Anyway, there are certain things that take time to change, and because that's the physical requirement of having to dig things up and put something new down. In the meantime, whatever is needed to assure that the water in your school, your, or your home is clean. If you can't make sure that it is clean, by getting the pipe changed immediately, you gotta provide the literal, the water. You gotta provide bottled water. Every issue you have raised here is of enormous consequence, enormous consequence. As I said, this is the United States of America. If we don't lead in every one of these areas, every one of them, we're not gonna be what the rest of the world expects of us. As much as it sounds sort of, uh, bragging about America, the rest of the world looks to us. We have the largest economy in the world. We have the most diverse population and a democracy in the world. And it's critical that we are able to do what we need to do, not only to make life better here. Everything from transgender, the prison system, to the environment, to education, to access to healthcare. It's not only critical that we do it for us, but the rest of the world's looking at us and saying, ""If we can do it, the United States as big as we are, and its consequences are, that we can make it happen around the world."" And that's, that's my goal. My goal is when I leave this job, people say, ""He kept his word."" To say, ""He did what he said he would do,"" in each of the areas you've all raised, prison reform, transgender, making sure we eliminate assault weapons, among other things, in terms of what, danger. Making sure the environment's clean, making sure education is affordable, and making sure that docs have the, all the training they need to deal with all the health issues relating to women. Vote, vote, vote. "
Joe Biden,"Sure. Well, first of all, for working people and middle-class people, it's a big hit. It is -- the inflation, at least for the time being, is real. I've done a couple of things. One, inflation is way up in terms of energy prices, particularly at the gas pump. And as -- what I did was, I was able to, under my authority, released 50 million barrels or five million barrels of oil from the petroleum reserve, which means putting more oil on the market, reducing the price of gasoline. Now, it's down -- in your city of Dayton, below $2 a gallon now to $2.99, be $3 a gallon, $2.99. And it was -- the national average is $3.32, but you're in a situation now where gasoline prices are coming down. And I think, they'll come down some more, as a matter of fact, because I've worked with other countries to also release some of their reserves to reduce the price, number one. Number two, with regard to the cost of food for every day -- now, that's another big area. People will walk in the grocery store, particularly meat, poultry, and the -- that's where the prices are up a lot, and there's a couple of things going on there. Number one, over -- as you well know, over the last several years, a lot of the big operators came in and bought out the small producers and bought out the small guys who were moving it from the farm onto your table. And so, for example, Tyson, this last quarter, made I think, a little over a billion more in profit than before because they're able to raise prices. There are so few people to compete with. I'm urging the Congress to hold hearings as to the concentration of power in a few hands, controlling the food-processing side of the equation. And in addition to that, my Build Back Better initiative is designed to really, in fact, look, what -- why is inflation hurt? Inflation hurts badly for the things you need, when the things you need if inflation and diamonds went up, it wasn't going to cost a lot of people in Miami Valley a whole lot of money. But inflation and food going up, inflation and gasoline going up, inflation and energy going up makes a big difference. And so, one of the things to do also, a way to help these folks is to reduce the cost of living for them and everything from child care to insulin, to the drugs they need, the prescriptions they need, to taking care of the elderly, to Pell Grants, to be able to get people in the school, and all those things in my Build Back Better plan reduce the cost of living for average Americans significantly. For example, there is a headline I'm told in your -- in one of the major papers in your city today saying that, this -- what people really cared about was the cost of child care and that 60 percent of the women who work part-time or didn't work at all will be back at work if they could afford child care. Well, for example, in this provision of my legislation says, you're not going to have to pay more than seven percent of your income in child care. That will save women or parents who have young children, and they can't go to work because of that, will save them literally thousands of dollars a year. And so, there's a lot of things we're doing that are going to bring down the cost of living for people and how they manage their everyday lives. The way I say to them, this is not going to cost a single, solitary penny. We're not going to increase the deficit by one cent in the Build Back Better plan at all. And what we did in the same thing in terms of the whole effort to rebuild our infrastructure, we're paying for it. And the reason we're paying for it, we're starting to ask people to pay their fair share. I'm a capitalist. I think we should be able to go out, make $1 million or $1 billion, but at least pay your fair share. You got 52 corporations in the Fortune 500 companies who didn't pay a single, solitary cent in tax the last two years. And guess what? They made $40 billion. It's not fair. Just pay your fair share. So, if we had people who were -- we have corporation paying a minimum tax of 15 percent and all the things we're talking about, it's all paid for and nobody making less than $400,000 a year will pay one single penny more for anything in taxes. I'm going to continue to fight those in court. Look, we have a -- when I came to office, there are only two million people who have been vaccinated. Since then, we have over 200 million people who have gotten at least one dose. And I believe the number is about 156,000 -- over 150 million, I should say, who in fact, have had -- or fully vaccinated. So, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, the unvaccinated, not the vaccinated, the unvaccinated, that's the problem. And so, everybody talks about freedom and not to have a shot or have a test. Well, guess what? And so, how about patriotism? How about making sure that you're vaccinated, so you do not spread the disease to anybody else? What about that? What's the big deal? What's the big deal of having to take a test once a week to know you can show up to work and you're not causing other people to get sick or your children at home? And what we've done now, is we've now provided for vaccines available for people five years and up, five years and up. And in addition to that, we now have -- Pfizer has a new -- it's not been approved yet, but it looks very promising, a new pill which should be taken in three days of contracting COVID you reduce by, I think it's so far, 89 percent likelihood to be hospitalized and die. And so, there's a lot of progress being made, a lot of progress. Like I said, when I came in, there were only two million people who have been vaccinated. I got enough vaccine for the entire country and part of the rest of the world. And it's not that we don't -- and it's free. You can show -- you can just go -- right now, you can go to your local drugstore, walk in, and get a shot. And by the way, if you haven't gotten your booster yet, get the booster. There's overwhelming evidence that it protects you and protects you in an extreme way. Not only sign it, I wrote it. This is submitted by me and the Defense Department, so I not only -- I hope they pass it. And by the way, we have to begin to focus on the change in defense needs. We have to invest in research and development and supercomputers. The ability to deal with things that we haven't dealt with before because we are -- the world's changing. It's changing in a significant way. We're the finest military in the history of the world, we have to keep it that way. No. No, John. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"Well, that depends on what the Ukrainians decide. But here's what we have to do in the meantime. We have to put the Ukrainians in a position where they can make advances this spring and summer and move to a place where negotiation, they can negotiate from a position of strength. And, but, you know, that expression event heard me use before and others, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. We're not going to dictate to them what the end result is. That means they decide that. They, the Ukrainians, decide that. But I could picture a circumstance where there's a transition to that. It's not all one time. Look, a year ago today, they were only 70 kilometers from the border where Russians expected to come rolling down into Kyiv and own it all. They got pushed back. It didn't happen. And I think they underestimated a great deal, the Russians did. Well, first of all, I'm not sure how many are asking that. I know the MAGA crowd is. The right-wing Republicans are, you know, talking about, we can't do this. We find ourselves in a situation where the cost of doing, walking away could be considerably higher than the cost of helping Ukraine maintain its independence. Look, we're sending him what our seasoned military thinks he needs now. He needs tanks, he needs artillery, he needs air defense, including another HIMAR. But there are things he needs now that we're sending him to put him in a position to be able to make gains this spring and this summer going into the fall. No, he doesn't need F-16s now. Look, first of all, the idea that we know exactly what's going to be needed a year or two, three from now, but there is no basis upon which there is a rationale according to our military now to provide F-16s. I am ruling it out for now. Look, it's not on China's, I had a very frank conversation with President Xi this past summer on this issue. And I pointed out to him, the conversation went like this. I said, Mr. President this is not a threat, it's an assertion, a statement what I think the reality is. You saw what happened when the rest of the world, Europe in particular, saw the brutality of what Putin was doing in Ukraine, to the Ukrainians from Russia. And I said, without any government prodding, 600 American corporations left Russia, from McDonald's to Exxon, to across the board. And I said, and if you are engaged in the same kind of brutality by supporting the brutality that's going on, I said, you may face the same consequence. I don't anticipate, we haven't seen it yet, but I don't anticipate a major initiative on the part of China providing weaponry to, to Russia. It would be the same line everyone else would have crossed. In other words, we'd impose severe sanctions on anyone who has done that. I'll let you characterize what they would be. We would respond. US intelligence is aware of everything that's going on in this area, but I'm not going to confirm specifically what US intelligence has found out or not found out. I think you answered the question. Putin is applauding it, so how could it be any good? I'm not being facetious. I'm being deadly earnest. I've seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia if the Chinese plan were followed. The idea that China is going to be negotiating the outcome of a war that's a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational. It is almost not relevant once it was over the United States. There is a possibility of that. That's what that balloon does, surveillance. Yes. There should be a direct open line of communications, particularly from two most powerful nations in the world to be able to resolve anything quickly so there's not a mistake made. We make it clear that it's necessary for that to occur. We can't fix it. Let's put this in perspective. Within two hours of that derailment, the EPA was in there, within two hours. Every major agency in the United States government that had anything to do with rail and/or cleanup was there and is there. In addition to that, I've spoken at length to the congresspersons, the governors, the senators from both states of Pennsylvania and, and in Ohio, and I've made it clear to them anything they need is available or will make it available. Whatever happens, you've got to understand, it's the responsibility of the railroad company who's made, by the way, tens of billions of dollars in profits. Tens of billions of dollars in profits lately. I can't recall. I don't think aye I've talked to the mayor there. I've talked to both the senators, both governors, everyone there is to talk to, and we made it clear that everything is available. Well, apparently, someone interviewed my wife today I heard. I got to call her and find out. No, all kidding aside. My intention from the beginning has been from the beginning to run, but there's too many other things I have to finish in the near term before I started campaigning. I say, God love her. Yeah. Look, I meant what I said. I've got other things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign. No. But it's legitimate for people to raise questions about my age. It's totally legitimate to do that. And the only thing I can say is, watch me. I've been advised by the counsel, let the Justice Department make that decision, to not try to alter the case in any way. There have been very few documents that have been confiscated, found in my possession that were in other than in my possession, meaning in my home. All the stuff that was moved out of my Senate office over the years, I'm told there were a couple of things from 1973 or '74 documents were marked classified. I don't know of anything maybe, I don't know of anything that is marked like it was, top secret, highly et cetera. But I'm told not to comment on that, because I don't even know what they were able to, what they confiscated. Because they were showing, you guys were showing on television things lying on the ground that said top secret, national, you know, code word. And the difference is, every single solitary thing I have been asked to do, I've done voluntarily. I've invited the Justice Department to come into every aspect of any place that I had any control off. There was no need for search warrants, no need, what do you need? Just come. Whatever you want. Whatever you want, wherever you want to go, you can go. That was totally different. You know, you're a good lawyer, but you're trying to make a comparison. What, there's degrees of irresponsibility. They can be significant degrees of irresponsibility. What, the way in which the boxes were packed up from my office, apparently not everything was gone through as meticulously as it should have, but there was no intention. I opened up my home, all my homes the home at the beach and the home that I, my permanent home. And they spent hours and hours going through everything, personal everything I had. And that's a fundamentally different thing. There's nothing for me to hide. No, but it's legitimate for people to raise issues about my age. It's totally legitimate to do that. And the only thing I can say is, watch me. Well, look, I think it goes well beyond the economy. Think about it. You make the – I mean you interview for the news. Can you think of anything you turn on the television and go, God, that makes me feel good? Almost anything? Everything is in the negative. We're also finding out now that one of the outlets has decided that they even put things on they know to be false in order to increase their ratings. So, I think things are a little out of whack. And I don't blame people for being down. You know, when you had a year, two years of the pandemic, kids out of school, the mental health problems in the country are seriously increased, especially among young people. Some things are, for example, even feeling down about unemployment. They've got better jobs, are making more money. Inflation is still higher than it should be, and, you know, everything from gasoline prices, to a war going on in Ukraine. I mean, so I can't think of a time when there's been a greater uncertainty, notwithstanding the fact we're created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We're better off than virtually any other major nation in the world, economically. But it's understandable why people are just down.  It's a big mistake to do that. Not very responsible. And, but I don't read into that that he's thinking of using nuclear weapons or anything like that. I think it's a, I'm not sure what else he was able to say in a speech at the moment. But I think it's a mistake. And I'm confident we'll be able to work it out. Well, look. I think we're less safe when we walk away from arms control agreements that are very much in both parties' interest, and the world's interest. But I've not seen anything, we've not seen anything, where there's a change in his posture and what they're doing. The idea that somehow this means they're thinking of using nuclear weapons, international continental ballistic missiles, there's no evidence of that. I didn't think it was that risky. Not 20 hours' worth, though. Well, look, I think that's for, I'm not being facetious, folks like you decide how important that is. It was important to me to stand with Zelenskyy and let the world know, on the year anniversary, we're not walking away from Ukraine."
Joe Biden,"Good afternoon. Thanks for having me on the show. I would have been even greater had the Phillies won, but yes. And, by the way, my wife's a Philly girl. She's a massive fan, and it's been an unhappy household for a couple of days. I know. don't rub it in, man. Don't rub it in. Still, so far, so good, man. They're flying high. Those eagles. There's a song Fly, Eagles, Fly. I think that's what they're doing. Well, you know, I'm always rooting for the U.S. national team. I -- and I took my family to the World Cup several years ago, and it was quite an event. We went down and we were in -- in South Africa for the finals. And, you know, it was -- we just had -- it was South Africa, and we're in Brazil in 2014. 2010, South Africa; '14 in Brazil. There's a lot of fun, but we've got some good teams. Argentina's got a good team. Spain has a good team. So, there's -- there's a lot of good teams, but I'm rooting for the United States. I'm hoping for them for a minor miracle. Is that you eat only for now because of your weight or because of the economy? Hey, look, we've done a great deal. First of all, under my administration, now, unemployment rate for Latinos is a -- is nearly a record low, near record low, was -- it's 4.2%. It was 8.6% when I took office. And Latinos are creating business -- new businesses faster than any other demographic in the country. We made health care affordable. Latinos saw a 53% jump in enrollment rates after we lowered the health care insurance premiums, provided -- [audio gap] billion dollars for Hispanic-serving institutions. We launched a whole government effort to increase by 50% the share of federal contracts going to minority-owned small businesses, which I promised. And, you know, we also did a lot -- we've done a lot. Look, when you have roughly 25% to 26% of all the kids in grades -- kindergarten through 12 speak in Spanish, we better damn well pay attention. The community is critically, critically important. And, you know, Latino families are -- you know, we've created 10 million jobs, and it's a record low unemployment. As I said, it's 8.6% when I took office. Now, it's 4.2%. It created a whole lot of real jobs. With a Made with -- a Made in America slogan. We're -- look, we're driving down inflation and by making sure we take care of your prescription drugs for your moms and your dads and for -- for example, I don't know if you know anybody who has who -- Who has diabetes and needs insulin. Well, guess what? Instead of them paying an average of 400 bucks a month a piece for their diabetes because of the law got passed, they're only going to have to pay a total of $35 a month. Thirty-five dollars because it only costs 10 bucks to make this and 15 bucks total to make it and package it. And they're charging between $400 or $600 for it, and it's just wrong. We finally took on Big Pharma and we beat them, we beat them. Big Pharma is going to be able -- Medicare is going to have to -- are going to be able to negotiate drug prices, just like the Veterans Administration does. And they cut prescription drug prices in half for veterans. And, you know, look, there's an awful lot going on. Because, you know, think of the -- take -- take a look at my administration. I want to make sure it looks like America. There's a significant number of Latinos that are in my administration for the first time. And, you know, health insurance is up now. Health insurance is up now. We got a whole lot of things. I think the future rests, in no small part, on how well the Latino community does. And it's about time we step up. And that's what I've been trying to do. And, by the way, one of the biggest things we've done is -- and our Republican friends keep trying to block it -- is that I've reduced cost of education -- student loans by $20,000 if you received a Pell Grant. You're going to have over -- over 50% of the Latino student loan debt is going to be eliminated, eliminated by what I've done. And so, it means that 16 million Americans could be getting 10 grand or 20 grand in student loan debt wiped out. But as I said -- Republicans, if they take control of the Congress, are going to try to do away with it. We're going to get it done. We've got to pass. We have one more court challenge to take on. And when we eliminate the debt, people get breathing room. They need to pay their bills, make life a little easier, put a down payment on a home or a business. So, there's a lot -- there's a lot we're doing. No, I do. Look, everything that I just said that my administration has done to benefit the Latino population is at stake because the Republicans running this time want to do away with all of it. They want to do away with the prescription drug benefit. They want to do away with the health care benefit. They want to do away with all the things I mentioned, including student debt and life. And so, look, you know, you know well, in the United States, the future is in our hands. There's a large Latino population, and it should vote, vote, vote is interest. And if you have to wonder about where to vote tomorrow, go to, you know, iwillvote.com and find out where you can vote because there's no excuse when we don't vote. And, by the way, these guys, these Republicans, want to take away Social Security as well. They've actually announced that's what they are going to do. They want to fundamentally cut Social Security and Medicare. And so, the point is that it makes a big, big difference whether you vote or not. It really does. And, you know, as I said, look, the reason we're a strong country is we're all immigrants. That's the reason why we're a strong company -- country. And, you know, you got guys like the senator from Florida, Rick Scott, who heads up the reelect Republican senators. He -- they put out their platform. Let me read a portion of it, ""All federal legislation --"" All federal legislation sunsets in five years. If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again, meaning if you don't pass it again, Medicare goes out of existence, Social Security goes out of existence. And there's never been such an onslaught on that. So, these mega Republicans, these -- these guys, this is not your father's Republican Party. It's a different deal. And I really think that everybody, you know, in America, you have an obligation to -- and so many -- so many of my Latino friends have come from states -- Where democracy -- where there's no democracy, where it's failed. And democracy is at risk here. We have to -- we have to get engaged. Where democracy -- where there's no democracy, where it's failed. Failed. Failed. And democracy is at risk here. We have to -- we have to get engaged. We have to vote. We have to be involved. And, you know, I think that there's a lot more to do. But it's -- why it's important to vote is there's a lot of stake: Medicare, Social Security, lowering health care costs, protecting democracy. And, you know, American prosperity is tied to the success of Latino families and communities. And all these accomplishments we've made thus far for Latinos in the last three years around the ballot. And the Latino community is decisive to ensure we can build on that progress. So, please vote. Please vote. Me too. I hope so, too. And thanks for having me on your show. I enjoyed. I hope you'll invite me again. Thank you. All right. I'll be looking for it. I'll be looking for it, man. Thank you. Bye."
Joe Biden,"No problems. It's all done. [Laughter] No, look, Anderson, we've been -- I've probably spent, well, well over 100 hours. This is a -- this is a big deal. We're both have -- we have two plans: one is the infrastructure plan -- roads, highways, bridges, buses, trains, et cetera -- and the other one is what I call the ""care economy"". It has a lot of money in there for environmental remediation as well as care economy. For example, you know, we want to get the economy moving, but millions of women can't go to work because they don't have any childcare. That kind of thing. So, there's a lot of pieces in there. There's a lot that people don't understand. And, by the way, all of it's paid for -- every single penny. It's not going to raise one single cent [inaudible]. I think so. You know, look, I've been -- I was a senator for 370 years. [Laughter] And I was never -- I was relatively good at putting together deals. No. No. I think banning assault weapons was the toughest deal I worked on -- and succeeded. [Applause] Yes. Well, look, you know, it's like my asking you, ""Are you sure your next show is going to be a success?"" Right? You know. Well, you're more confident than I am. Look -- hey, look, it's all about compromise. You know, ""compromise"" has become a dirty word, but it's -- bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible. When I ran for the presidency, I said I'm running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul and decency in the country; two, to build the middle class and the working class so they were -- we build from the middle out; and three, to actually unite the country. And everybody has been saying, ""Well, that's crazy. You can't do it."" If we can't eventually unite this country, we're in deep trouble. I do think I'll get a deal. Morgan State. All right, man. [Applause] I've spoken there. Well, let me ask you: Do you have -- how old are your kids? God love you. [Laughter] Well, look, there's two pieces. There's the childcare -- having someone take care of your child while you are working, while you and your wife are working. Under this proposal I have, no one will have to pay -- unless you're making more than -- individually, you're each making -- making over 300 grand --$150,000 apiece. Oh, God. [Laughter] And, by the way, I'm married to one: Dr. Biden -- right here. [Applause] So -- so you will not have to pay more than 7 percent of your income for childcare -- 7 percent. And the way we do that is we provide for the ability to have childcare centers funded. The money won't even go -- you don't -- the -- figure your income; you get 7 percent with the total cost. But there's another piece here: You now are qualified to be able to have a Child Tax Credit. It used to be that when you -- you know, when you -- if you were -- had enough money to pay significant taxes, you could write off 2,000 bucks for every child you had and reduce it from your taxes. But if you were making 60,000 bucks a year and you didn't have that much to write off, you didn't get anything. Well, I call this a tax break for middle-class people. If you're making in the $150,000 range right now, you're in a situation where you can get, if you have a child under 7, $350; if you have a child over 7, between 7 and 17, you can get $300. And you get a direct payment. You -- the IRS sends you money. No. Here's the deal: All these people are working anyway. [Applause] And, by the way, you know, why should somebody who is not working and has -- you know, makes -- has a million-dollar trust fund, why should they get the benefit, and someone making 60 grand and not working, but staying home, why should they not get anything? I don't get that. Yes. That's a different issue. Yeah. Yeah, it is down to four weeks. And the reason it's down to 4 weeks is I can't get 12 weeks. [Laughter] And -- but, look, here's the deal, guys: How many people do you know -- not a joke -- or maybe yourself -- have had a circumstance where you are working like the devil, you're making 7 bucks an hour, 15 bucks an hour, or 20 bucks an hour, and you have a child that's sick at home -- or you have a mother or a father, husband and wife, son or daughter, and you need to stay home to help them? We're one of the few industrial countries in the world that doesn't have paid leave -- so that when you stay home to help that person, to take care of that person, you're still getting your pay. And it does not hurt the business at all. The business isn't paying for it; the federal government is paying for it. It's a little bit like, as I said, a tax cut for people who are not able to otherwise take care of their families. And, look, I'm looking out here, and a lot of you are part of that sandwich generation: You have young kids, and you have aging parents. And one of the things all the polling data shows, Anderson, is people are more concerned about taking care of the elderly, because they don't know what to do, than they are even their children. God love you. Bingo. Well, first of all -- [Applause] -- if my mom were here, she'd say you're a good daughter, number one. Number two, I was in a situation like you, where I was making more money -- I was making $42,000 a year as a senator at the time, although I was listed the poorest man in the Senate for 36 years, but -- [laughter] -- I still made more money than most people because Senate salaries kept going up. What happened was my -- my dad got sick, and he was in hospice, so Jill and I took my dad home and we took care of him in our house. But we were lucky because we had the ability to have -- I have a sister who is an angel and a brother who's a wonderful guy, and we all took turns in our house taking care of them. But here's the deal: Right now, under Medicaid, there are 860,000 -- I think it's 860- -- don't hold me to the exact number, but it's over 800,000 -- who qualify for home healthcare aid for their parents, but there's no money there. There's no money there. So what we do is we provide the funding for Medicaid to allow you to be able to keep -- if your parents had their home -- keeping them in their home if you wanted, or get help in your home with homecare from professionals providing -- helping you take care of them -- helping you take care of them. And in many cases where you're not taking care of them in your own home and they're staying -- and they're staying in their home, you're going to be able to have the ability to have someone come in and make their meals for them. They don't have to be there 24/7. So, there's a lot of things we're doing. In addition to the process, we're going to be able to train up those homecare workers who are usually minority women, women of color, as well as immigrants. And they have the capacity to learn more as they go along, to move to the point where they can become practical nurses and things like that. So, it makes a lot of sense, and it's cheaper -- cheaper than it is to not do it. That's a reach. And the reason why it's a reach -- it's not -- I think it's a good idea, and it's not that costly in relative terms, especially if we allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. But here's the thing: Mr. Manchin is -- is opposed to that, as is -- I think Senator Sinema is as well. Opposed to all three. Because they don't want -- he says he doesn't want to further burden Medicare so that -- because it will run out of its ability to maintain itself in X number of years. There's ways to fix that, but he's not interested in that part either. [Laughter] But, look, Joe -- Joe is not a bad guy. He's a friend. And he's always, at the end of the day, come around and voted for it. But -- but here's the point: We're in a situation now where if you are in a circumstance that you're not able to provide -- let me cut to the chase; I'm taking too long. [Laughter] One of the things we were able to do in the meantime is -- the most expensive of these things would be dental. Okay? Now, we're talking about -- and I don't have a deal on it yet -- maybe getting an $800 voucher from Medicare for dental work that you may need. And the hearing is a very important thing because -- as Kyrsten Sinema, who supports this, points out -- hearing is directly related to dementia. When you can't hear, you have a problem, and it impacts on dementia. So, we're able to, I -- and it's cheaper to be able to take care of hearing. But I think I've been able to take care of that without changing Medicare, because what's happening is now you have these hearing aid companies; you no longer are going to have to go to the doctor and spend five grand and get an app- -- you can go buy at Walgreens, and buy over-the-counter hearing aids. [Applause] So -- the harder one, though, is we -- we haven't gotten a consensus yet on how to deal with seeing, glasses. And -- but that's -- so ""it's not done yet"" is the answer. By the way, Ben, the Bidens all hail from Baltimore, beginning in 1850. [Laughter] I don't know how the hell they kicked me out, but I'm -- [laughter]. Well, I think what's fair is that -- this present tax code, the highest tax rate is 35 percent, number one. Okay? Number two, you're in a circumstance where corporate America is not paying their fair share. And I come from the corporate state of the world: Delaware. More corporations in Delaware than every other state in the union combined. Okay? Now, here's the deal though: You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America making over $40 billion, who don't pay a cent. Not a single little red cent. Now, I don't care -- I'm a capitalist. I hope you can be a millionaire or a billionaire. I -- not a problem. But at least pay your fair share. Chip in a little bit. And so -- Because you don't have -- look, here's the deal: The tax rate -- the corporate tax rate was 35 points-some -- 37 percent. Barack and I thought it should come down. We thought it should come down to 28 percent. In the process, it came down to 21 percent under Trump, which even the corporate leaders -- and you know if you're in real estate -- major real estate. Ask them. They know they should be paying a little more than 21 percent. Because the idea that if you're a schoolteacher and a firefighter, you're paying at a higher tax rate than they are, as a percentage of your taxes. But here's the deal: I believe that we can do the -- we can pay for this whole thing -- I have it written on a card here, but I won't bore you with the detail. But, for example, if you in fact made sure that you paid a minimum 15 percent -- minimum 15 percent -- if you're paying nothing -- minimum 15 -- that's almost -- that's over almost $400 billion over 10 years. Here's what I'm willing to do: I'm willing to make sure that we pay for everything without anyone making less than $400,000 paying a single cent more in taxes. That's my objective. And so, there's ways to do that. For example -- you covered it on your show -- the minimum international tax at 15 percent. No. No. I don't think we're going to be able to get to vote. Look -- [laughs] -- when you're in the United States Senate and you're President of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, every one is a President. [Laughter] Every single one. So, you got to work things out. But where I am is, I'm hearing now -- I'll turn on the news and I'll hear that ""Biden's caved on such and... "" Look, Biden has a simple proposition. Biden is going to get -- all the elements of these two bills have profound impact on economic growth; reduce, not increase, inflation; don't add a penny to the debt; as well as grow the economy. According -- I had 17 Nobel laureates in economics sent me a letter recently saying that my proposals would actually reduce inflation, diminish [inaudible]. But here's the point. The point of it all is that I'm prepared -- I can't think of anything that was consequential and changing the circumstance for the middle class and working class in America that came as a consequence of a single piece of legislation. I got a portrait of Roosevelt in my office. Okay? Social Security is not anything like it is today when he passed it. It evolved. It moved. It grew. So I'm prepared to do the things that can get done now that can begin to change the lives of ordinary Americans to give them a fighting chance and come back and try to get others later. And, by the way, you got another English professor who teaches writing here. [Laughter] Well, first of all, Professor, you made a very profound point, and I'm not -- I'm not being sarcastic -- and that is -- and Jill uses a slightly different phrase: ""Any country that out-educates us will out-compete us."" Any country that out educates will out- -- out-educates will out-compete us. You have the vast majority -- of the 37 major cor- -- countries in the world -- economies -- we rank 35 in our investment in education. We're in a situation where if you -- if you think about it, when we -- what caused us to move ahead and dominate the 20th century: In the late 1900s -- in the early 1900s, late 1890s, we came up -- we said, 12 years of free education. That was revolutionary at the time. I mean, seriously. Now, if we were sitting down today and saying, ""Oh, we got to put together an education system,"" raise your hand if anybody thinks 12 years is enough to compete in the 21st century? So, that's why what I propose is: free child -- free school -- free school for every three- and four-year-old in America, no matter what their background. All the data shows that no matter what home they come from, they increase exponentially their prospects of succeeding all the way through 12 years of school. You know -- you know all the statistics. The statistics go that if you come from a home where there's no books in the home and a single mom or a single dad, they don't -- they're not well educated, they don't talk a lot, the kid from the middle class -- average middle-class home versus that home will go to school having heard 1 million more words spoken than the child who didn't. A gigantic disadvantage. No, I know. I -- Oh, I -- Yeah, and I'm going to get it done. [Applause] And if I don't, I'll be sleeping alone for a long time. [Laughter] But here's the deal: So far, Mr. Manchin and one other person has indicated they will not support free community college. So, what I've -- what I think we can get done is we can significantly increase the amount of money by 500 bucks a payment for Pell Grants. And Pell Grants are available, and they can apply for up to 30 percent of the cost of community college and/or -- and/or college help tuition. So, it's not going to get us there. It's not going to get us the whole thing, but it is a start. I'm convinced -- absolutely, positively convinced that we're going to be able to -- and, by the way, we have in the law -- in the legislation, money for community colleges that deal with -- dealing with apprenticeships, dealing with teaching people particular skills that are not getting -- will not get you a two-year degree but will teach you the skill. So, I think we can get all of that done this time out. But I promise you -- I guarantee you, we're going to get free community college in the next several years and across the board. [Applause] Well, the White House has a lot of bedrooms. [Laughter] And she went like this. [Points] [Laughter] ""Down the hall."" No, look, it really makes a gigantic difference. And think of this: You have more countries in the world with -- having -- providing college -- I mean, providing professional education beyond 12 years. We rank like, I think it's -- don't hold me to the number -- I think it's 16 or 17 in the world -- the United States of America, for God's sake. This is about putting us in the game. Where -- where are you? I know all these Morgan men, man. [Applause] I've spoken there a couple times. And, by the way, the guy who runs my operation is a -- anyway -- [laughter] -- I -- I keep talking about Delaware State, but they keep saying about Morgan State, you know? Well, two reasons. If you notice, the Republicans haven't passed a single, solitary thing. Zero. So, ushering through their agenda -- their agenda right now is just ""stop Biden."" Although, I shouldn't make it so personal. ""Stop my administration"" -- that's what the agenda is. It's much easier to stop something than to start something. And look, what we did is, when I wrote -- I'm going to back up just a second. I apologize. I wrote -- I personally -- during the campaign, before I got elected, I wrote the infrastructure bill relating to what we do to highways and all that kind of thing. Hard -- hard data. And I wrote the -- what they call -- what's now called the ""care economy"" piece and has a gigantic piece of environmental pieces in it too. And I went before the joint session of Congress, and I laid out exactly what I was for. And so, I made it clear what I was for. Initially what happened was, I got no support for anything from our Republican friends. And then they said, ""Maybe we can work out a bipartisan deal on infrastructure."" And we did. We worked on it. It didn't give me everything I wanted. It didn't have as much money in there for the environment, although it has tens of billions of dollars in there, but didn't have what I wanted in it. But we made a bipartisan deal. Now, what's coming along is this reconciliation -- they call it a fancy word -- for the other pieces that have the childcare pieces, have the economy that relates to allowing people to -- women to go back to work. It has about $450 billion for environmental remediation, and so on. And that's the one that is the issue. No -- First of all, she's smart as the devil, number one. Number two, she's very supportive of the environmental agenda in my legislation -- very supportive. She's supportive of all -- almost all the things I mentioned, relating to everything from family care to all -- to all those issues. Where she's not supportive is she says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and/or on wealthy people. Period. And so, that's where it sort of breaks down, and there's a few other issues it breaks down on. But what we're trying to do is reach a point here where I'm able to present to the Senate -- they're able to vote on -- and the House -- a serious, serious piece of legislation that changes the dynamic for working-class folks in America and middle-class folks, and begins to have the very wealthy and corporations just begin to pay their fair share -- not a lot. How we get there -- we're down to four or five issues, which I'm not going to negotiate on national television, as you might guess. No, no, no. No, no, no. I know. But, all kidding aside, I think we can get there. Mr. President. Well, that's -- [Applause]. Mr. President, you got it right. The existential threat to humanity is climate change. And when President Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord -- which, when I was with the Obama administration, we helped negotiate -- the agreement was that we could not -- if we reached beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in temperature, we're gone. Not a joke. Not a joke. And so, we decided that -- he pulled out. First thing I committed to do is rejoin that accord, number one. [Applause] But number two -- number two: What you have to do is you look at -- there's multiple ways in which we can deal with climate. I'm going off to COP26 in Scotland, and -- in, I don't know, I guess it's two weeks or a week. I -- I'm losing track of time. And -- and I'm presenting a commitment to the world that we will, in fact, get to net-zero emissions on electric power by 2035 and net-zero emissions across the board by 2050 or before. But we have to do so much between now and 2030 to demonstrate what we're going to -- that we're going to do. So, let me give you a couple examples. No, it hasn't. No, it ha- -- look -- He's opposed to it. But here's the deal: That is only one of well over -- well over a trillion dollars' worth of expenditures for climate change. It's $150 billion. It's important. And what it says is that if, in fact, the utility doesn't pull back and continue to reduce the amount of carbon that they admit, that what will happen is they will end up paying a penalty. And so, there's a penalty incurred. Joe Manchin's argument is: Look, we still have coal in my state. You're going to eliminate it eventually. We know it's going away. We know it's going to be gone. But don't rush it so fast that my people don't have anything to do. I think that's not what we should be doing, but the fact of the matter is we can take that $150 billion, add it to the $320 billion that's in the -- in the law now that he's prepared to support for tax incentives -- tax incentives to have people act in a way that they're going to be able to do the things that need to be do from -- For example, if you're -- if you -- if you got windows that are the, you know, the wind is blowing through, you get an incentive to put new windows in your home. You get -- you -- help get it paid. We're going to significantly reduce the amount -- the cost of solar panels on your roof. We're going to continually -- and, for example, there's new battery technologies that are being -- I went out in Silicon Valley; there's a battery that's about that wide and about that thick. If you have solar power, you put that in your basement and the sun doesn't shine for seven days, you still have all the power you need. No, no, no. No, no -- Nothing has been formally agreed to. The concession has been -- the negotiation is: I've been saying to Joe, ""Look, I'll take -- if we don't do it in terms of the -- the electric grid piece, what we'll do is -- give me that $150 billion. I'm going to add it to be able to do other things that allow me to do things that don't directly affect the electric grid in the way that there's a penalty, but allow me to spend the money to set new technologies in place."" For example, we can save significant amounts of money and, as a consequence of that, significant amounts of energy, if, in fact, we are able to put the high-tension wires underground. It costs a hell of a lot more to do it. It creates real good jobs; it creates a hell of a lot more to do it. But, in fact, it would do a lot to keep things from happening that are dangerous. Half the forest fires out West are those towers coming down, setting fires, et cetera. So, there's a lot of things Joe is open to my convincing him that I can use it to increase environmental progress without it being that particular deal. Yeah, so, first -- First of all, we've created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any President in American history -- total number of jobs created. But the problem for the people not going back to work is twofold. Number one, they're reluctant to go back to work because they're afraid of COVID -- many of them. So they don't want to go back and they don't want to be exposed to either the customers because they're not required to wear masks or not required to have shots, or they don't want to go back because they're not sure of the people waiting on them and they -- at the table, or the people coming up in the food market. So, a lot of it has to do with COVID. Number one. Number two -- and that's why, you know, we were able to go from -- when I first got elected -- when I first was elected, there were only 2 million people who had COVID shots in the United States of America -- had the vaccine. Now we got 190 million, because I went out and bought everything I could do -- and buy in sight, and it worked. [Applause] But here's the deal: The second thing -- the second thing that has happened, Anderson, is that people are now using this as an opportunity to say, ""Wait a minute, do I want to go back to that $7-an-hour job?"" I won't name the particular restaurant chain, but they found out when they -- they couldn't hire anybody. When they found out, they started to pay 20 bucks an hour, everybody wanted to go back to work. Not a joke. So what you see is wages are actually up for those who are working, because for the first time in a long time, employees are able to bargain. ""You're the boss? You want me to work for you? What are you going to pay me? How are you going to do it?"" I'm not being facetious. The third thing that's out there is there's a circumstance that exists where people are really worried about what they're going to do -- I mean, how -- how can I say this? How many people do you know -- and maybe some in this audience -- who, because of what you've been through -- a loss of a husband, wife, brother, mother, father, son, whatever -- or you've had something that's really impacted you with COVID that you really find yourself just down? I mean just down. And so, there's a lot of people who are just down. They're not sure how to get back in the game. They're not sure whether they want to get back in the game. Think of this: If you're graduating from Morgan State, okay? [Applause] Right? Well, guess what? You didn't have those great dances the last four years that you'd had before you went out at Morgan. No, I'm not joking. Graduated from high school, you don't have your prom, you don't have your graduation, you don't have the thing -- all the things that matter to people that go into things they look forward to. So, a lot of it has to do with us getting back on our feet and getting back on our feet in terms of our attitudes about what the future looks like for us. What I say -- Well, there are. And I tell you what: There's plenty of help. Look, being down, having some problem in terms of needing some -- some advice -- if you have a broken spirit, it's no different than a broken arm. You shouldn't be ashamed of it. You should seek the help. There's a lot of people who can help. [Applause] And -- but I really mean it. I -- I don't -- I'm not saying that's the whole problem, but I'm saying it is an element in terms of attitude about people -- what they want. Look, how often I get asked the question, ""What's Christmas going to be like? How about Thanksgiving? Is it going to be okay? I mean, what's going to happen? I mean, how will I be able to buy gifts for my kids?"" How -- there's a lot of anxiety people have. Hello, Anna. They are. Yes on both. [Applause] Here -- but you -- but you have it exactly right. We have a significant supply chain problem. In the Obama-Biden administration, all of American business -- and it made sense -- it was just on time. You wanted to make sure that you didn't waste any money and/or time between producing whatever you're producing and having it done. You didn't -- so that's how you saved money. You didn't buy the material six months ahead of time and then keep it in your inventory and then move it. It was on time. Now, that's a big problem. You can't -- people can't do it. They want to get out ahead. What I've recently done -- and people said -- doubted we could get it done. I was able to go to the private por- -- 40 percent of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through Los Angeles and -- and -- oh, what am I doing here? Long Beach. Thank you. And I know both the mayors. So I went to them and I said, ""What can we do?"" So I met with -- and they're privately owned, these ports -- these two. So I met with the business people. I met with all their major customers -- the Walmarts of the world and all the rest. There are like 70 ships waiting out there unable to get unloaded. So, I -- and because -- not always -- the longshoremen don't always get along with the business folks in there. I got -- I have a relationship with them. And I brought them together, and I said, ""You got to be open 24/7."" No port there was open tw- -- open five days a week, 40 hours a week. 24/7 -- they've all agreed to it. They've agreed to it. Yes, absolutely, positively, I would do that. But in addition to that, what you got to do is you got to get these ships in and unloaded. And one of the things in my -- my infrastructure plan: There's $16 billion for port expansion. We have to be able to move things along. Because what's happening is, when we -- a product your mother may need for interior design, in terms of drapery or colors or something, that is imported from somewhere else. Well, guess what? A lot of these places, particularly in South Asia, are closing down because of COVID. The businesses are just flat closing. They're -- Yes. Yes. But here's -- and that's why what we're doing now -- Well, I had a timetable to -- first of all, I want to get the ports up and running, and get the railroads and the rail heads and the trucks in port ready to move. Because I've gotten Walmart and others that say, ""We're going to move stuff off of the port, into our warehouses."" Which [inaudible]. The answer is -- The answer is: Yes, if we can't move the -- increase the number of truckers, which we're in the process of doing. If we did at this moment, we're not -- but the whole point is: We've got to get the small business as well, because the big guys are in trouble. And a lot of the product that your mother makes, the product she -- the things she does in her interior design building, the material she buys from the larger outfits. I assume; I don't know that. I -- I -- but my whole point is: Small businesses need the help badly. Small businesses make up 60 percent of all the revenue coming from business out there. Hey. Well, there's a number of things that have already been done. And it's hard -- and people don't think about -- the American Rescue Plan has provided for an awful lot -- the $1.9 billion we passed right at -- right after I got elected. So, what you got is you got that -- that $1,400 check in the mail, and you got a lot of things that help ameliorate some of the concerns and costs, because we knew what we were coming into. We knew we had inherited the wind, and things were going to get worse before they got better. But in terms of being able to have what my dad used to say, ""a little breathing room,"" just a lit- -- my -- my dad busted his neck. He didn't have a good-paying job. My dad was a well-read high-school-educated guy who thought his greatest sin in the world was he didn't get to go to college. And -- but my dad was one of those guys that worked like hell, would come home for dinner, and then he'd go back and finish up work and close the shop. He -- and -- and the whole point of it was that all we want to give -- all he'd talk about is ""Joey, all I need is just a little breathing room, a little space -- a little space."" I -- I don't think so. I don't think it will last if -- depending what we do. If we stay exactly where we are, yes. If we don't make these investments, yes. Gas pri- -- Gas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative that is about something that goes beyond the cost of gas. And we're about $3.30 a gallon most places now, when it's up from -- when it was down in the single digits. I mean -- single di- -- a dollar-plus. And -- and that's because of the supply being withheld by OPEC. And so, there's a lot of negotiation that is -- there -- there's a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me. I'm not sure I'm going to talk to them. But the point is, it's about gas production. There is things we can do, in the meantime, though. My guess is you'll start to see gas prices come down as we get by -- going into the winter -- I mean, excuse me, into next year, in 2022. I don't see anything that's going to happen in the meantime that's going to significantly reduce gas prices. But, for example, for natural gas to heat your homes as winter is coming, there's a lot -- what people don't realize: We put in billions of dollars in what they call ""LIHEAP."" LIHEAP is the provision whereby you're able to get funding from the federal government based upon your need to heat your home, and it is subsidized in a significant way. And there's billions of dollars we have passed in the legislation I got passed in -- in March of this year, because we anticipated that would be a problem, as well. But the answer ultimately is -- ""ultimately"" meaning the next three or four years -- is investing in renewable energy. What I was able to do -- [Applause] -- no, I -- and, by the way, I really -- I'm not -- I'm not being -- I mean, I'm being literal when I say this: What I was able to do when I ran -- and you remember, Anderson, because I was on your show a couple times, and the issue was whether or not I could ever get the labor unions to support my environmental programs. And I went out and I went to the IBEW and, as well, to the autoworkers, and I laid out my plan. They fully embraced it. Why? Because -- and I spent time at General Motors and other companies, and I got General Mo- -- I didn't get them -- General Motors decided, after a long time spent talking to me -- they were suing California because they had a higher standard -- mileage standard. They dropped the suit and agreed that they would be 50 percent electric vehicles by 2030 -- by 2030. [Applause] And now you have all three -- all three major manufacturers saying the same thing. So, what will ha- -- what will happen is: You're going to see a dramatic drop -- a dramatic drop in what's going to happen in terms of gas prices as we go into the next two or three years. Even if we're not able to break the monopoly price -- they're keeping it up because -- anyway. So there's -- there -- but I don't -- I must tell you, I don't have a near-term answer. There's two things I could do: I could go in the petroleum reserve and take out and probably reluce [sic] -- reduce the price of gas maybe 18 cents or so a gallon. It's still going to be above three bucks. And one of the things that I refuse to have happen, because I didn't want anybody -- I made a commitment: If you pass the stuff I'm talking about, not -- not one single penny in tax would go against anybody making less than 400 grand. And so, if you notice, this is -- these highway bills are not paid for by gas tax. They're paid for by direct expenditures in other areas. So, the average person doesn't have to pay more. But it's going to be hard. It's going to be hard. There's a possibility to be able to bring it down. Depends on -- little bit on Saudi Arabia and a few other things that are in the offing. I believe -- and I want to make it clear: Unlike past administrations, science will dictate this. I'm not telling anyone at -- [Applause] -- no, I really mean it. [Applause] But I do ask my COVID team what the expectations are. The expectations are it'll be ready in the near term -- meaning weeks, not -- not months and months. Okay? That's number one. Number two, there are over 800,000 sites right now that exist in America where you can go get a vaccine. And you're going to be able to do that with your children, particularly -- we're going to try to work it out to deal with childcare centers -- make it available there -- as well as your pediatricians and the -- you know, and the docs -- and finding places where you can do it. Some places are talking about doing at -- you know, in churches on the weekend and that kind of thing. So there'll be plenty of places to -- to be able to get the vaccine when -- if and when it is approved. And it's likely to be approved. I spent a lot of time with the team on these things. And it's likely to be approved and what -- whether it's Moderna or whether it's Pfizer or whether it's J&J, it's going to be approved. And it will be a much smaller dose -- basically the same dose, but a smaller dose. And they're doing a lot of tests on it right now. And -- and those of you who have children or brothers or sisters who are between -- you know, who are in that age category above 12, get -- get the vaccine for them. Get the vaccine. [Applause] Get it now. By the way, there's two famous guys in this audience here. I just noticed. [Laughter] Ben Cardin -- [Applause] -- and Chris Van Hollen. [Applause] And the mayor! Holy mackerel. This is a busman's holiday for you guys, having to come here. [Laughter] But thank you. Yes and yes. [Applause] And, by the way -- by the way, I waited until July to talk about mandating, because I tried everything else possible. The mandates are working. All the stuff about people leaving and people getting -- you have -- you have everyone from United Airlines to Spirit -- all these airlines. They're -- we're not going to get all -- 96, 97 percent of the people have gotten the vaccine. All the talk about all these folks who are going to leave the military if they were mandated -- not true. You got about a 90-something percent vaccination rate. I mean, so there's a -- the idea is that -- look, the two things that concern me -- one, are those who just tried to make this a political issue. ""Freedom. I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID."" [Laughter] No, I mean, come on. ""Freedom."" [Laughter] Number one. Number two -- the second one is that, you know, the gross misinformation that's out there. Like what they're saying about my buddy Colin Powell -- [Applause] -- and he was my friend -- who passed away. ""Colin Powell was vaccinated, and he still died."" Well, he knew he had serious underlying conditions. And it would be difficult -- he clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine, had he not gotten the -- the shots. But my generic point is: There's so much misinformation. And you know what I find fascinating? I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am. [Laughter] Well, I -- I'm doing very well. [Laughter] I think I'm at 3 percent favorable. But -- [laughter] -- But all kidding aside, one of the things I find: Do you realize they mandate vaccinations? Yeah. [Applause] I find that mildly fascinating. Mildly fascinating. Yep. First of all, you've stated the proposition accurately, in my view. I did get overwhelming support from the African American community. Only folks in Maryland understand Delaware is the eighth-largest Black population in America, as a percent of population. It's been the source of my support. The only folks that helped me more than Black men are Black women. [Applause] And -- and I tell you what my greatest regret is: My greatest regret is I have these -- had these three major pieces of legislation that are going to change the circumstances for working-class folks and African Americans, as well, that I've been busting my neck trying to pass. But what it's done is prevented me from getting deeply up to my ears -- which I'm going to do once this is done -- in dealing with police brutality, dealing with the whole notion of: What are we going to do about voting rights? It's the greatest assault on voting rights in the history of the United States -- for real -- since the Civil War. And, you know, for example: When I was in the Chair- -- when I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I thought I had done something really important. And I was able to get passed and extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years and get everyone on that committee, including the southern -- the senator from South Carolina and others, to vote for it. I thought we had moved. The point I'm making is this: We're at a terrible place right now. And so, when this gets done -- and in the meantime, here's what I've done: I have the authority to deal with federal law enforcement. So federal law enforcement, I've -- we've issued mandates: no chokeholds, number one; make sure that we're going to be able to do -- have no no-knock warrants; in a position where we're going to be able to see to it that we are able to go look at -- and we're doing it in four cities right now -- patterns of abuse and patterns of misconduct of police departments; making sure that we have access to police records, in terms of what's happening in -- So there's a lot I've been able to do by executive order, in essence. By the way, I think they make a very good point. Here's the deal: If, in fact, I get myself into, at this moment, the debate on the filibuster, I lose three -- at least three votes right now to get what I have to get done on the economic side of the equation -- the foreign policy side of the equation. So, what I have said -- you're shaking your head no, but let me tell you something, Jack: It's the truth. [Laughter] Number one. Number two. Number two, what I have proposed in the meantime is -- it used to be the filibuster. The way it worked -- and we have 10 times as many -- more than that -- times the filibuster has been used since 1978. It used to be you had to stand on the floor and exhaust everything you had, and you -- when -- and when you gave up the floor and someone else sought the floor, they had to talk until they finished. You're only allowed to do it a second time. After that, it's over; you vote -- somebody moves for the vote. I propose we bring that back now, immediately. [Applause] But I also think we're going to have to move to the point where we fundamentally alter the filibuster. The idea that, for example, my Republican friends say that we're going to default on the national debt because they're going to filibuster that and we need 10 Republicans to support us is the most bizarre thing I ever heard. I think you're going to see an aw- -- if they -- gets pulled again, I think you'll see an awful lot of Democrats being ready to say, ""Not me. I'm not doing that again. We're going to end the filibuster."" But it still is difficult to end the filibuster, beyond that. That's another issue. But -- I am open to -- -- fundamentally altering -- Well, that remains to be seen, exactly what that means, in terms of ""fundamentally altering"" it, whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up. There are certain things that are just sacred rights. One's a sacred obligation that we never are going to renege on a debt. We're the only nation in the world -- we have never, ever reneged on a single debt. Voting rights is equally as consequential. And maybe more. No, the way I said it was not appropriate. I said -- they asked me would I -- do I think that he -- they should be prosecuted for denying the -- for not showing up at the committee. And I said, ""Yes."" Now that -- when I've made a commitment -- the plu- -- the -- one of the things I was committed to do when I ran was re-establish the reputation and integrity of the Justice Department. It has become the most -- it was corrupted under the last administration. I should have chosen my words more wisely. I did not, have not, and will not pick up the phone and call the Attorney General and tell him what he should or should not do in terms of who he should prosecute. [Applause] But, I answered the question honestly. And I think that a -- anyone who does not respond to that kind of en- -- question from the -- from the -- a legitimate committee in the House of Representatives or the United States Senate should be held accountable. So that's as much as I can say without coming and looking like I'm telling the -- I have yet to talk to the Attorney General about anything [inaudible] -- And they will. I guarantee that. Well, again, I'm leaving that to them to tell me what -- and I didn't -- it's not a blanket ""I will not release the information."" It's, I'm asking them to take a look at what is legitimate -- what would legitimately fall in the position that future Presidents' authority would be compromised by that, and what is. I don't think there's much legitimacy in the claim. So that's being looked at right now. Well -- [Applause] -- they're legitimate questions. Number one, the Remain in Mexico policy, which I oppose, the Court said I had to maintain it. So, we're repealing it. That's one of the reasons why we haven't changed it. We have made a gigantic change -- there were over 5,000 children -- children -- in the -- in the custody of the Border Patrol. There are now 504. We are making more progress than you think. And we have a circumstance where one of the things that is going to bear fruit, I believe, is: I put together a program when I was a senator, and the Vice President is helping -- helping initiate it now, where we provide for funding to change the circumstances on the ground in the countries in Central America. For example, you're in a circumstance where, you know, people don't just sit around their -- their hand-hewn table and say, ""I got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give it to coyote, let them take us across the border, drop us in a desert -- a place they don't want us. Won't that be fun?"" People do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do -- and I'm trying to do in this legislation, as well -- is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them. We don't have that. Yes. Yes. And that is -- we've maintained that because of the extent of the -- of the -- continued extent of COVID in those countries from which people are coming. It's very, very high. And so, we've maintained the policy. We are -- we are not sending back children. We send back adults, and we send back fa- -- large families. But we don't send back children in that circumstance. And so that's why I have a proposal to provide for over a billion doses of COVID vaccine to the rest of the world, including a significant portion to Latin and Central America. I've been there before, and I haven't -- I mean, I know it well. I guess I should go down. But the -- but the whole point of it is: I haven't had a whole hell of lot of time to get down. I've been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion worth of damage done by -- by hurricanes and floods and -- and weather, and traveling around the world. But I plan on -- now, my wife, Jill, has been down. She's been on both sides of the river. She's seen the circumstances there. She's looked into those places. You notice you're not seeing a lot of pictures of kids lying on top of one another with -- you know, with -- with bla- -- with, you know, looks like tarps on top of them. We've been able to deal that -- we've been able to significantly increase funding through the HHS -- Health and Human Services -- to provide shelter for these kids and people. But there's much more to be done. And -- and I realize -- I -- I think it is -- it's the thing that concerns me the most about being able to get control of it. Because I got to, number one, get enough funding to provide for immediate determination of whether or not someone that is, in fact, legitimately claiming a right to stay in the country because of legitimate fears. And it's purely for economic reasons to get in line but not get in the country. So, what we're doing is bringing a lot of folks who are coming in and they're doing ankle bracelets instead of people being sent back, depending on whether or not their claim appears to be legitimate. Well, it depends what they mean by that. Look, I -- I -- I grew up in a neighborhood -- Well, could. I think you need police officers. I think we need police officers to protect us. I think they have to be under certain changed circumstances. But I think we have to provide for them more opportu- -- I call for more money for police to go to community policing, as well as dealing with additional help for psych- -- psychologists and others working with police departments. No, I haven't. I've never supported. But I've been a fan -- [Applause] -- of controlling police and making sure they're held accountable. That's a -- they're two different issues. And one of the things -- look, when we had community policing, initially in the late '90s, violent crime dropped significantly -- significantly. And the reason it did is because we had significant number of police. What I did: I eliminated the LEAA funding -- Law Enforcement Assistance Act -- [Applause] -- and I put in place the proposal that required community policing. What that meant was: If you were all -- it's going to take a second, but it's important. [Laughter] If your -- what -- what that meant, if your city had authorized a police force of 100 people, you could not take the money for community policing and fire 50 people and rehire 50 so now I just had the federal government paying for half and you didn't increase the number of police. You had to increase the number of police beyond your wh- -- whatever. So, I remember my son Beau was the chief law enforcement officer of the state of Delaware as attorney general of the state of Delaware. And he used to do what I did. He'd go down the east side where you can find the best basketball in the coun- -- in -- in the city. You know, every -- every town has those -- those places. And he'd sit there on the bench with my son -- my grandson, Hunter, who's now 16, who was then 5, sitting the bench and he'd get to know these guys. And he'd walk over and he'd knock on the window of the police car that was sitting there -- the cop not getting out of the car -- and say, ""Get the hell out of the car and meet these folks."" ""No."" I'll give you one example: What we required initially was every police -- every community policeman -- there were two assigned -- they were assigned in groups of two -- they had to know the neighborhood. I remember getting a call, as you -- you've been to Delaware; you go down that road as you're heading down to the [inaudible] station -- Martin Luther King Boulevard. There was a woman who lived in one of those apartments in the second floor that sort of had an outcroppings -- a Victorian kind of -- it was a two-story place. And what -- but the cops made sure they had -- she had their phone number. So, when a drug deal was going down, she'd pick up the phone on call and say to that police officer with a cellphone that the drug deal is going down, knowing that she would never be fingered, knowing that she would never be the one told it happened. And so, crime began to drop. They had to know who owned the local liquor store. They had to know and walk in and shake hands with the local minister. They had to know -- that's community policing. I'm sorry. Ask easy ones. Well, I think that's up to the locality to decide what they want to do on that. Look, there's -- there's a lot of -- there's a lot of people who have no social redeeming value, historically. And there's others who have made serious mistakes in they -- in -- in terms of what -- what exists now in terms of what we should be talking about, but have done an awful lot. And so, the very thing -- for example, I just spoke at the Martin Luther King dedication. And I pointed out that we're right across from the Lincoln Memorial. Well, you know, and -- and you talked about -- and -- and then the Jefferson Memorial. And what -- what are we doing? I talked about how they said, ""We're unique in all the world, as a nation. We're the only nation founded on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by... "" No nation has ever been founded on an idea. Have we ever lived up to it? No. But it's a pretty big idea that somebody wrote that down and got the rest of the country to agree to it. So it depends. It depends. And it's -- Where in Connecticut are you from? That's great. Yes and yes. We are -- militarily, China, Russia, and the rest of the world knows we have the most powerful military in the history of the world. Don't worry about whether we're going to -- they're going to be more powerful. What you do have to worry about is whether or not they're going to engage in activities that will put them in a position where there -- they may make a serious mistake. And so, I have had -- I have spoken and spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other world leader has. That's why you have -- you know, you hear people saying, ""Biden wants to start a new Cold War with China."" I don't want a Cold War with China. I just want to make China understand that we are not going to step back. We are not going to change any of our views. Yes. Yes, we have a commitment to do that. He had enormous integrity; they knew that. But he's one of the few serious, serious players I've dealt with over these years who, when he made a mistake, he acknowledges it. He said, ""I ackno- -- I was wrong about it."" No, it's rare. It's been rare -- it's rare in human nature for someone in a powerful position to say they are wrong. They are wrong. ""I made a mistake."" That's a hard thing to do. And I've had to do it about a half a dozen times lately. [Laughter] But -- but all kidding aside -- And the second thing about him was he had a lot of serious -- he had real compassion. You know, his -- well, I'll tell you afterwards, but -- because we only have a few minutes. He and I went out to the Secret Service racetrack. He had a brand-new Corvette his -- his family bought -- his kids bought him. And I have a '67 327/350, and we raced. We raced. [Laughter and applause] And, you know -- you know, the only reason -- no, I'm serious. It was on ""Jay Leno."" Check it out. ""Jay Leno Live."" He's -- he's a hell of a guy. Well, I won only because he was worried I was going to crash into him. [Laughter] Because I don't have positraction, so I was burning rubber the whole way out there, and I could see him going, ""Whoa."" [Laughter] Sixty seconds. We got in the car to go over to the -- the Department of Education after we did that. No, no. He got in the car, and he was laughing like hell. I said, ""What's so damn funny?"" And he told me. I whispered in his ear -- this way. I looked to see where it was. I said, ""I'm going to -- and this is a big deal."" And I didn't realize the guy behind me was really lipreading. You can see it. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. The answer is: Yes, this is bigger. No, it is bigger because -- not -- not because what he did wasn't enormous. He broke the ice. Enormous. But part of what I have in here is we also increased access to the Affordable Care Act, and we reduced the price an average of 60 bucks a month for anyone who's in the Affordable Care Act. Plus, on top of that, we have another 300 billion dollars' worth of healthcare ever -- in it. So, it's -- I would say this is a bigger darn deal. [Applause] Thank you very much."
Joe Biden,"Hey, Kyle. I am sorry to keep you waiting, I really am. I did. [Laughs] The answer is yes. There, you all are going to get in, in the state of Kentucky, well over $10 billion. And, uh, for highways, for example, uh, $9.2 billion for highways and four, half a billion dollars for bridges. And, uh, it's, uh, been listed as one of the most notorious bridges in the country. And, uh, and so my guess is that, uh, that's gonna be the choice that your governors are gonna make and want to get done. And, uh, we can get it done now. Right. Which one may I ask? Wh -- what do you want me to answer first [Laughs]? Oh, le -- lets start off talking about supply chain. One of the problems of the supply chain is that because of COVID we've had, uh, a -- a, uh, uh, a real shortage of mat, of materials. I mean everything from food stuffs to, to, uh, um, semi conductors. And, uh, and a lot of the supply chain is brought into the country, uh, through, um, uh, oh, through our ports. Part of, so one of the things I did, I, uh, I went out to Los Angeles and, uh, uh, for -- forty percent of all the goods come in the west coast, come in through two ports. Uh, in, uh, in the Los Angeles area. And, uh, they're privately owned but I got the longshoremen together and the privately owned operators and we got them to go from being open 40 hours a week, to be open 24/7. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to speed up because we had over, I think it was 700, or, 74 cargo ships were lined up, couldn't get in. But it's that way all over the country, that's one of the reasons why we put so much money in here for bridges and ports and airports, so we could speed up supply chains. Not just now, but in the future. And the first part of your question was whether or not we could, when we start to see this happen -- Wh -- what with the money. I think you'll start to see it happen, literally, in a matter of weeks. For example, in your state, um, in the state of Ohio, there are a number of people, a number of people who do not have high speed internet. 14% of the people of Ohio have no internet, a lot of them in rural areas. And then you have 28% of the people who have internet, but can't afford it. So if there's money in here to provide for all, ev -- everyone in the state to have internet and affordable internet, that ought to be starting fairly s, quickly. Putting a lot of people to work by the way. A lot of electricians to work. It's also gonna be, there's, uh, there's money in here for significant amount of money for, uh, $140 million for electric charging stations. You put on the highways throughout your state. There's a whole range of things that could go quickly. Now, how long it takes to, uh, for, to get for example, there's a, uh, 10 million American households our drinking bad water. Well, in Ohio you expect to, you're gonna receive $1.4 billion dollars, statewide, to fix your water pipes -- a lot of lead pipes, so that you no longer have the -- the safety hazards. So, all of this stuff, you're gonna start relatively quickly. Well look, I, uh, the poll I saw just before I walked in, on another station, was my polling number is down but it's 48 percent to 52 percent. But look, the -- the -- the point is, I didn't run because of the polls. I think what you're gonna see is the combination of what I did in the beginning, in terms of Recovery Act, and then -- then, the -- the, and this legislation. As well as a legislation that we're about to pass, God willing, on infra, on, excuse me, on what's called Build Back Better, everything from childcare to pro, funding three and four year olds in school, et cetera. I think all that's gonna have a -- a significant impact on ordinary Americans. They're like the households that I came from, that in fact are gonna change their circumstance and result in, essentially tax cuts for the childcare they'll get. Tax cuts for being able to send their kids to, the three and four years old to school that they otherwise have to pay for it. So there's a whole lotta things that are gonna be happening. I think this is an up and down, you know, proposal, oh, excuse me, an -- an -- up and down circumstance. And as I looked at the polling data, literally as I was walking outta the office after doing another thing I had to do, is my polling numbers are the same, essentially what, uh, everyone from, uh, Bush to, uh, uh, to, uh, to, um, Clinton, to, you know, all -- all the, uh, Obama, were at the same time. But again, I don't think, I don't think presidents should be deciding what to do about, look, a lot of people are worried. Think about this. Look what, 750,000 people have died because of COVID. 750,000 people. Now, the -- the -- psychological scars that has put on so many people. Schools have not been open because of COVID, and they're just getting open again. We're in a situation where there's a lot of, a lot of anxiety. Gas prices are up exceedingly high, they've been up this high before but not -- not recently. Gas price, that, that's why I have the attorney general taking a look at whether or not these gas companies are gouging people because although the price of oil is coming down some, the price of gas hadn't come down some. So there's a lot of things that have people, that are really a great deal of anxiety, a great deal of concern. And uh, and they all relate to, even though we've created almost six million jobs since I came into office, we're in a situation where people don't, I mean, they don't feel it right now. They don't feel it. I'm sorry to be late. I hope I can see you again. I apologize for -- a little foreign policy issues. I apologize. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"Some sunscreen. Manny MUA, can you hear me? Doing well. These rumors of vaccine passports, I think it just plays to paranoia in some people, particularly with younger people, and that's just not the case. But if you've been vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask, and if you're not, you should wear a mask for your own safety's sake and for the sake of the people you care a great deal about, the people you love. It's so easy for people to get a vaccine. All you have to do is text your zip code and the number 438829, they'll tell you exactly where you can go to get a vaccine. You can get it quickly, and you know what? Uber and Lyft have come along and they've said that for the end of May, all the way through to July 4th, anybody who calls them, they'll pick them up, take them to a vaccine site, wait for them and take them back. That's a big deal. I think my wife, before I headed to that island would tell me that you better bring some sunscreen. You too. Hey fellas, how are you? I'm doing well. Mine's really calm. You know, exposing somebody to something that is going to be for their benefit, and if they learn about it, they'll be able to do good by it. It's the same way I explain to parents about why their 12 year-old should get the shot, and I talk about it in terms of teaching about obligation to other people. It's not just about them, it's an obligation they have to their friends and other people. Now on your show you do, you talk about the obligation we have to take care of what we've been given in the wild, and so on. They have that vaccine, they can get on a plane. They're probably still going to put a mask on on most planes, trains, and buses, but they're going to be able to go wherever they want to go. Thank you guys. You're awful nice. Thank you. We're doing well. How are you doing? I understand you have some questions. It's all about protecting other people too. It's not just about you. It's about your obligation. When I set up this commission that we've put together, that Dr. Fauci's the best known member of it, I asked one person to do nothing but deal with equity. What we found out was that an awful lot of African-Americans, especially older African-Americans may live theoretically within five, seven miles of a drugstore, but guess what? That might well be 500 miles of the drug store. They have no way of getting there. Not all, but many don't, and so how do we get the vaccine to them or them to where the vaccine is? So we've vastly expanded where we made the vaccine available to 80,000 sites. We put mobile units. If you can't get to them, they can't get to the site, the site can go to them."
Joe Biden,"I'm happy to be here. Well, there's not so much up in the air if we -- if we listen. What I was able to do is get over 600 million doses of the -- of the vaccines available, the three vaccines. We've -- and I -- When I announced -- I've only been in office a little over a hundred days, not -- not quite a hundred days. And I announced we were going to do -- we're going to make sure we did a hundred million shots. We're gonna be up to 200 million. We have 600 million vaccinations available by -- And so, we have enough to begin to vaccinate everybody in the entire United States. But people have to be responsible, Sage. They have to continue in the meantime to wear masks when they're around someone. I have my mask off now because there's no within 30 feet of me but you have to wash your hands and keep social distancing. And so it's gonna be a little while. We can't, you know, and some people think they're being tough guys not wearing mask. Well guess what? They're -- they're hurting themselves and other people as you have a patriotic duty to protect the people around you. But God willing, the way with the vaccines are getting out now, and the way we're working, I think we ought to be able to, as I said, a goal that by the Fourth of July we'd be at least to have a small barbecue in the backyard with family. And by the time we get into the fall, hopefully, things are moving. I don't think early in the baseball season that's going to happen though. I'd say, ""Look, I'm President of United States, I got vaccinated. You know, it's not I don't have an unimportant job when I take the vaccination, the vaccine. If I didn't -- If I think it was going gonna hurt me or affect my capacity. Look, we've done an incredible scientific research on the three vaccines that we're using now: the JNJ, Pfizer, and Moderna. And they work. There's even studies now showing that with a Pfizer that works on younger people, 15, 16, 17 years old. So we're making progress but we have to get to the point where enough people have taken the vaccine, so you've diminish exponentially the prospect of it being able to continue to spread. You know, I carry in my pocket a -- my schedule, and every single day I have my staff -- I don't -- well, I take it out here. Every single day I have my staff list the total number of people who have died as a consequence of these -- of this COVID crisis. It's 547,296 people dead. We've got to be more responsible. Well, that's a decision they made. I think it's a mistake. They should listen to Dr. Fauci and the scientists and the experts. And -- but I think it's not responsible. Well, the longer time we have to get more people vaccinated -- We're now at the point where we have almost 75 -- we'll have 75% of the people over the age of 65, the most vulnerable population vaccinated. And we're moving across the board that way we're significantly increasing the number of people vaccinated. And that's going to diminish the prospects of its spread. And so what I think, it's just in terms of being responsible. You see what's happening in Europe now when they lifted the mandates. They're going back. I don't know why we just don't follow the science and beat this. Just flat out beat it. We're gonna have enough vaccination -- vaccinations, vaccinators. I've gotten thousands more vaccinators, people to do the vaccinations. We've opened up places particularly for -- there's some communities that are really hesitant because of past history. The Black community knows that as recently as the end of World War II there was experimentation, you know, on African-Americans. That's not happening now but I understand the hesitancy. And we're -- we're doing everything we can to make it clear to people. Get the vaccine as quickly as you can get it. Get in line. And by the end of -- by the end of this month, we're gonna be in a position where everyone, everyone in fact, is going to be able to get the vaccine no matter what your age. It's not going to be only people over 65 etc. I think we should move in that direction. I think today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that. People look to them, they're leaders. Look at what's happened with the NBA as well. Look what's happened across the board. The very people who are victimized the most are the people who are the leaders in these -- in these various sports. And it's just not right. This is Jim Crow on steroids what they're doing in Georgia and 40 other states. What is this all about? Imagine passing a law saying you can not provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Can't do that? Come on. Or you're going to close a polling place at five o'clock when working people just get off. This is all about keeping working folks and ordinary folks that I grew up with from being able to vote. You don't talk to her. You don't talk to her and the other -- the other time, like, for example: I was having a meeting when I'm vice president when the Flyers were in the playoffs. We have a German Shepherd who is an old guy now but he was much younger and I'm downstairs with -- with a meeting with the Republican and Democratic leadership trying to work out a deal, and all of a sudden I hear, ""Ahhh, whoa!"", screaming, coming from upstairs. I walk upstairs, she's sitting, I swear to God, sitting in front of this television, with our dog Champ, with a Flyers jersey on, the dog had the Flyers jersey -- -- watching the game. The dog did, she put it on the dog. But she is a -- Look, Philadelphia fans are incredibly notable fans but, boy, are they tough. They are really tough, tough fans. Where I'm at -- I do but one of the things is that, you know, it's interesting. I thought I was a pretty good athlete in high school. And and when I played ball, baseball and football, and -- and my my brothers as well. But the real athletes in our -- in our family are -- are -- are -- are -- are the women. I have a young daughter, granddaughter I should say, who is two state -- state -- all-state and two sports. And almost in a third sport. I got all the girls in my family are -- they're really competitive, good athletes. I have a niece who is an All-American. And then I get some really, really talented women in my family, so I take the backseat to the women in my family. Well, they are. I tell you what. It's -- And it's about time they get paid, by the way. The idea that we're have -- we -- we went to the World Cup in 50 with my granddaughters out in -- out in Vancouver and watched the women's team win. We watched -- we went to the -- Also in South Africa. Anyway, and the idea that these women are getting paid depending -- just overall where women 82 cents on the dollar. If you're a Black woman it's like 55 cents on the dollar, generically, just across the board. But the idea that, you know, women's soccer players are -- are getting paid so much less than the men. I just don't think it's right. I don't think it's fair. And that is why I am such a big supporter of Title IX. Yeah. I think so too. Absolutely positively. Well, the one -- the one thing is I -- I -- when I threw the first pitch out in Washington a couple of years ago, I remember everybody talked about this -- why you're doing it from the rubber? It's because that's where you pitch from. And I thank God it was -- And the catcher at the time said, ""Whoa, it was a typical ball. High and outside."" At least it went across the plate. Tha's a victory. Thanks a lot. I look forward to seeing you. I look forward to meeting your person. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"I've been fine. But I will worry about this election. We got to get out and vote to make sure the progress we've made, particularly in African American communities, is sustained because these guys want to wipe it out. Oh, I did go to that school. I forgot all about that. Oh. God loves him. Well, I -- really, it's no different in the white community either. We just got to call it plainly and straightforwardly. Number one, we made it easier for people who went to college, who acquired a debt going to college, to be able to pay it off by forgiving $20,000 in student loans to get people out of the hole -- So they could start to put their lives together, to start businesses, to be able to do things that really matter; $10,000 debt relief for eligible borrowers, another 10 for anybody who received the Pell Grant to get to school. And that's -- 71% of the African American undergraduates received the Pell Grant. And they got a $20,000 reduction in their debt. In addition to that, and I kept the promise, we put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. And we got -- we got one of the brightest members of the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. She is incredible. I also said I was going to make the court look more representative. So, now we have -- we've appointed more African American women to the appellate courts of the federal court -- And that is right below the Supreme Court nationally, than every other president combined in American history. I told you I was going to help. HBCUs also provide for the best education they could possibly do. They just don't have the endowments that other universities have. So, they're not in a position to build laboratories and all these stations like colleges with big endowments have. And so, what happened is I've provided for nearly $6 billion to historically Black universities so that they could serve and secure the largest increase in Pell Grants over the entire decade and get people to those schools. I appointed HBCU board advisers to help the HBCUs and provide the resource the highest-quality education. Our friend, Tony Allen, president of Delaware State University, is a chair of that. We worked on voting rights to core this democracy. And I prioritized that issue from day one, calling for the passage of John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. I'm doing everything I can on a priority, get that done -- Because, look -- but there's so much that we've done. We've also provided for -- there's unemployment among African Americans as low as is been in history. We're also in a situation where we provided for the opportunity for people to start businesses. And, you know -- and I guess the thing I'm proudest of in the courts is Ketanji Brown Jackson. She is smarter than most of everybody. I'm like -- I'm serious. No, she really is. Not -- not a joke. I said I was going to get the most qualified person that I could find. She's as qualified as any person ever appointed at the Supreme Court. That's not a joke. That is not a joke. That's deadly earnest and serious. Sure. Absolutely, positively, it will survive. Look, a post-high school education should be the ticket to the middle class. The cost of college is skyrocketing for too many borrowers, even people with a little bit of money. The price of college has tripled in the last four years. And Pell Grants used to cover 80% of the college tuition, not only cover 1/3 of it. And so, here's the point. There's only one case left out there where we have to clear the bar here. You know, it means 60 million Americans could be getting $10,000 to $20,000 in student debt forgiven. Republicans, if they take over the Congress, they're going to turn their backs on those working families. My job [ph] is clear. I want to give working and middle-class Americans more breathing room, not make it harder for them to get by. And by the way, the other thing I've done and no one's paid much attention to, I've said anyone who's ever been arrested for the possession, a mere possession of marijuana, that gets wiped off their record. And they never have to answer again, ""Have you ever been arrested?"" You can say no. Legally, you can say no. And by the way, that's kept a lot of African Americans -- And Americans across the country from being able to qualify for a whole lot of programs. And one more thing, you know, when someone does their time in prison, they should, when they get out of prison, have every right that everybody else has. And so, right now, we give folks 25 bucks and a bus ticket -- And end up under the same bridge they got arrested under. And so, what they should be qualified -- they qualify for federal housing, qualify for federal loans, qualify for Pell Grants, qualify for all the things that give them a chance to put their lives straight. They've paid their pride. There's a website that allows you just to -- for example, there's a website you can sign up for -- Getting the student loans. And the website is studentaid.gov. Studentaid -- go online to studentaid.gov. And one thing I wanted to make sure we did here is we were in a situation where anybody who had a student loan and wants to qualify for forgiveness, that we ran a program to determine whether or not they could be able to quickly determine whether they qualify. And so far, hundreds of thousands have qualified because it's so simple. You just call, and it's real quick. There's only five questions you get asked. You get notified whether you're qualified immediately. Now, we just got to get this last quarter out of the way. You know, but these Republicans -- and this -- look, there's a lot of Republicans I know that want to help. But I think a lot of the Republican members of the House and Senate are just afraid of these -- these major Republicans. I swore I'd never say the names, so I won't. But about 10 months ago, on occasion, there was one bill up. I won't even mention the bill. Six different Republicans contacted me to say, ""Joe, I know you're right. But if I support it, I'm going to get defeated. They're going to primary and knock me out. I'll be gone."" So, I'm convinced that if we're able to get people out to vote in this election and if we're able to maintain the House and the Senate, you're going to see a significant change. Yes. I'm going to be -- we introduced and we lost by a couple of votes. We lost the effort to ban assault weapons. Assault weapons travel at five times the speed of any bullet coming out of any other weapon, number one. Number two, they're smaller. They can penetrate everything, including Kevlar vests. They are devastating. They can be easily moved into some semiautomatic to automatic. And think of this. Think of the number of cases. And I've been almost to every one of these schools and shooting areas for long -- I mean, spent hours there. Here's the deal. You know, you had up to 200 rounds. We should limit the number of rounds you could have in a magazine of a gun. So -- and to -- at the maximum, 10. It should be -- I think it should be less, but the -- the idea you could hook up to the weapon 200 rounds, you don't have to reload for 200 shots -- It's outrageous. So, here's the thing. Vote. Did you ever think you'd see a day when someone's going to show up with a box to drop off their mail ballot, there'd be guys sitting at 10, 12 yards away with automatic weapons across their chest and a bulletproof vest? I think that -- that's war intimidation. It's wrong. It's simply wrong. That I'm still 50. That's the first thing I'll tell him. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. That's number one. Number two, I can't even say that, number 80. But I'm serious. I no more feel that than -- than I got out of this job, behind this desk and fly. But number one. Number two, look, there's only one reason to be involved in public life, and that's to help people. I come from a family that's a typical -- we live in a three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. We weren't poor, but we didn't have everything. And by the way, for 36 years in the United States Senate, to the end, I was listed as the poorest man in the Congress. I wasn't poor. I just didn't have any savings. I didn't have any money. I didn't -- I didn't own my house. But I was in a situation where I had a salary, a senator salary, which is a good salary. But -- so, I mean, I understand what it's like when the price of gas goes up. When I was growing up, and we sit at the kitchen table, and dad would talk about that. And there's just so much that's available to help people. And by the way, we've done all this by cutting the deficit more than anyone has in American history. ""Big spending. Joe, give me a break."" I cut the deficit by $1.4 trillion this year, last year by 350 billion. All the Republicans are doing is driving up that cost. They passed a $2 trillion tax cut with the last guy that went to the very wealthy, and they didn't pay a penny of it. So, my point is, there's a lot we can do. And nobody -- nobody making under 400 grand, and I didn't know anybody growing up million, anywhere near that. Pay the penny more in taxes. There's so much we can do. And we're just getting started. Look, pray for our democracy. Pray for our children. Pray for our adopted children who are so often left behind. Pray for our American troops. Look, I just came from mass. I'm a happily practicing Catholic. And I just -- I believe in prayer. I -- I carry with me a rosary my son had in his hand when he died. From Iraq, he got home, he was a -- won the Bronze Star that could speak [ph] to his service medal. He was a major in the US Army, a year in Iraq. He came home with brain cancer. I tell you, I guess the best way to say it is, when my son came home, he went as fit as you could be. He was the attorney general. He gave up his seat to go with his -- his National Guard unit to Iraq, spent a year there. He came home with stage 4 glioblastoma, for which they had not found a cure. It was only a matter of months. And I was with him, and he asked me whether I would sit at the table with him and talk a little longer after my two grandkids got up to leave and his wife. And he looked at me and said, ""Dad. Promise me, Dad."" We have an expression in our family, my mom used to. He said, ""Look at me, Dad. Look at me, Dad. Promise me. Promise me you won't stop. I'm going to be OK, Dad, no matter what happens. But promise me you won't stop."" He wanted to make sure that I stayed engaged. And I didn't want to stay engaged. But I kept the promise I made him. The promise is to be involved. We can change things. We can change things. It's not always easy, but we can do it. And I'm more optimistic about the chances for America than I have ever been because of folks like you, because of people who are out there who are just breaking their neck and trying to change -- this younger generation is most qualified and talented, least prejudiced generation in America. There is so much we can do. I really believe it. And you got to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America for God's sake. There's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. We just have to have a little soul. I got in trouble when I announced -- it was the presidency. I said I was running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of America, and I meant it. Decency, honor, commitment, treating people with dignity, and to rebuild the middle class and the working class by working from the bottom up, not the top down -- And unite the country. The hardest part is uniting now. But we can do this. We can do this. I promise you. I promise you. Mrs. Hill, God loves you. Thank you. Thank you for listening. Come and see me in the White House. All right, pal, keep me in your prayers. I'll keep you in mine."
Joe Biden,"Yes, but there are close seconds that we're going to have – that are going to be announced in a couple of days. We have another 50 million that have been put in arms, so it will be 250 million. And one of the things I focused on when I got elected, I said I had two overwhelming needs; one, to get the American public vaccinated, and we had to go out and get an awful lot of vaccinators as well as vaccine to get 600 million doses of it, and we got that, a lot of it, done. And to get people back to work, because, you know, we lost millions of jobs -- 22 million, I think it was 22 million jobs. And they're directly related to the vaccine -- not to -- to COVID-19. So, what I'm continuing to do is making sure we get people back to work and change the circumstance where we get to the far point, where we have at least 70 percent of the American public vaccinated, and my goal is by July the 4. And I think we can do that. We're close to 59 percent getting one shot, so I think we're getting very close. They're showing up. All this stuff about vaccine hesitancy; the truth of the matter is more and more and more people are getting the vaccine. And so, I've never believed that there would be a large percentage of Americans who wouldn't get the vaccine. But what's the best way -- you know, you used to do local politics a hundred years ago -- what happens? When your neighbor gets a vaccine, your next-door-neighbor gets it, you say, well, maybe I should get it. And no matter what your position was, when you see people in a position where you can easily get the vaccine, you don't have to go way out of your way. That's why you see I was on doing some meetings with folks who are providing for example and the governor of Maine, a Republican, is saying, if you want to get a free hunting license, come get a vaccine. Well, people are showing up. And people are showing up across the board. So, the idea, I've never believed that at the end of the day, there would be any large percentage of Americans who would not get the vaccine. Well, I say they shouldn't worry. They should get the vaccine. They should get the vaccine. What I have said is that it's one thing for people who are in country here to have, if they show up for a doctor's appointment, they show up to drop their child off at school, et cetera, we should lay off those people. We should, and that's why I introduced a comprehensive immigration bill. There's 11 million undocumented people in the United States, the vast majority of whom overstayed their visas. We should move about getting that taken care of, making sure there's a pathway to earn citizenship and get underway. They should not be in a position that, if they're trying to save their lives or their health and they do what's needed to be done to make people around them safe as well, they shouldn't be penalized for that. Well, look, there was a red line saying they wouldn't do anything on anything, quite frankly. Yeah. I understand that. That's -- but I think we can have a deal. And there are ways in which we can pay for this without just putting the entire burden on working class and middle-class people. For example, there's a situation where there's an estimation of somewhere between $700 billion and a one-trillion-three-hundred billion dollars, if we hire up more IRS agents and we go after those folks who are avoiding taxes at the top end. And that is -- I mean, these are serious -- this isn't pie in the sky -- these are serious, serious experts and liberals, conservatives, et cetera. I'm confident, for example, something that's not in the, that two-trillion-dollar tax cut for which nothing was paid for, and it ended up being -- increasing the debt. There's a thing called stepped up basis. That's not in it. Stepped up basis is complicated. I didn't know what it was; I never had any money, so I didn't know what it was. But for example, if you have a capital gain, you're a wealthy person, you're about to cash-in, you bought a million-dollars' worth of stock, now it's worth it's worth one-million-five-hundred-thousand, you're going to cash it in, and god forbid, on the way to cash it in, you figure being hit by a truck and you die, that gets left to your son or daughter; they pay none of the capital gains you would have had to pay. It's not an inheritance tax. It's a tax owed 10 seconds before it happened. Eliminate that. That raises billions and billions of dollars. So, there's ways to do this. -- neither of those were in the [Inaudible] -- [Crosstalk] No. I didn't get into that. I got into what constitutes infrastructure. I want to make it clear. I want to get a bipartisan deal on as much as we can get a bipartisan deal on. And that means roads, bridges, broadband, all infrastructure. But I'm not giving up on the fact that we have, you know, two million women who are not able to go back to work because all the daycare centers are closed. They're out of business. And so, they can't go back to work. I'm not going to give up on a whole range of things that go to the question of productivity, of increasing jobs, increasing employment, increasing revenues. I'm not willing to give up on that. So we're going to fight those out. So I want to know, what can we agree on? And let's see if we can get an agreement to kickstart this. And then fight over what's left and see if I can get it done without Republicans, if need be. If a man looks me in the eye, gives me his word that something's going to happen, I take it unless he breaks it. He may have broken his word to somebody else, but to me, has he made that deal -- we're nowhere near having made a deal. We agree that we should try to get a bipartisan agreement. But the Liz Cheney/McCarthy thing is above my pay grade. I mean, I have enough trouble figuring out my own party all the time, let alone the Republicans. I think I heard Kevin McCarthy say today Biden's a duly elected president. As Pat Moynihan once said to me, Joe, I'm not sure you're Irish. You don't hold a grudge. [Laughter] I don't. Look, it's too important to the American people. I don't want to sound – I'll just say what I believe. It's too important to the American people for me not to continue to reach out to get things done with people that I agree and disagree with. I mean, I ended up making a deal with Jesse Helms for the lord's sake on funding the United Nations. I didn't have to give up anything, but I worked on it and worked on it. He finally came around. But if I had said, because Jesse Helms has done all these other things, I'm never going to deal with him -- it's just not the way it works. I don't -- look, I believe -- how can I say it? My mother used to give me -- I believe in redemption for myself as well. But look, Lawrence, I have -- I once had a doctor who was -- had worked on me because I had had an aneurism 20 some years ago. He said, you know what your problem is? He said you're a congenital optimist. Well, I am, because I know the American people. The American people are optimistic. The American people never ever, ever, ever, ever give up. Never. Not once in our history did they give up. And I just – I have faith. I have faith, and we just got to keep pushing it. I don't know. I've not had -- I've not had that discussion with Joe. I've been meeting with a lot of Republicans, a lot of, quote, ""bipartisan groups"" have been coming to see me on everything from my – the overall bill, the families bill that I have and the caregivers bill, as well as the infrastructure bill. We were at the same place. I don't know -- I can't say that you asked me, but other serious folks in your business asked me the same kind of questions when we were trying to do the American Rescue Plan. How can you possibly get it passed? Well, it passed by one vote, even though up to the time that vote took place there were a number of people saying, I'm not going to do it. But look, Lawrence, I have -- this is going to sound naive. I have faith in the American people. The American people overwhelmingly support what I'm doing. The polling numbers are overwhelming -- Democrat, Republican, and Independent, the averages. We've got 78 percent of the American people, if I'm not mistaken in the last major poll done, showing that they support my -- what I'm talking about, this gigantic effort to try to build back and build back better. You had an enormous number of American people supporting the last bill that passed. And look what's happened -- 1.5 million new jobs, 1.5 million new jobs. You had all that money in there for COVID. We've now got -- we have 250 million people will have gotten shots. The death rate is the lowest it's ever been. It's down 80 percent. Hospitalizations are down. And so, I just think with all I -- what I have to do is just keep moving forward. Just keep moving forward, and the more we move, the more I demonstrate what we've done is working and is right, the more likelihood I'll have to get it -- look, for example, you know, we used to be, back in the old days, when I first got to the Senate, we used to invest in research and development, the things of the future. We invested more money than any -- a higher percentage of our GDP than any nation in the world. And China was number I think nine or something. We're now number eight. China's number one. What do we think is going to happen if we stand still for god's sake? What do we think is going to happen if more corporate American doesn't invest in research and development instead of buying back their own stock? What do -- I mean, so, I think this is a matter -- this is a bit of -- as my grandfather, Finnegan, might say, this is a bit of an epiphany that's going on here where people are beginning to look and say, whoa, whoa. And I've met with either on the -- almost all on a telephone and/or on Skype, with I think now 40-some world leaders. They want to know, is America really back? Are we really back in the game? Are we going to engage? And so, I just think -- I know this sounds -- well, I don't know what it sounds like, but you know, it's never ever, ever been a good bet against America. That's never occurred. It's never been a good bet, to bet against the American people, and I'm betting they're going to come around. I'd say, Beau, I remember what you'd say to me every single time we'd talk about a political issue. He'd say, Dad, look at me. I'd give him my word. Dad, look at me. Remember, home base. Home base. Be who you are. The one thing that I'd hope that he would say is, Dad, you're home base, you're sticking to it. Some things are worth losing over, old buddy. I haven't done this, this long than I had now to do things that I don't -- I don't believe. Thank you. You always catch me off guard with Beau. God love him. He should be sitting in this chair. Anyway, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"Well, Reverend Al, you know this as well as I do. You think about this new Republican Party. This is not your father's Republican Party. These are neither Republicans. It's Trump Republicans. And they -- number one, they think the only election that is one that is legitimate is one they won. If they didn't win, there must have been -- there must have been fraud. And so, they won't accept -- you have 320 so election deniers on the Republican ticket running for those offices that control the electoral process in the state -- the states and local offices, as well as federal. And they made no bones about it. And these guys, how in God's name can you call yourself a supporter of the Constitution when you say you only win when -- when you win. If there is any dispute, then it must be that there was cheating. And number two, all these guys who stormed the -- one who stormed the Capitol on January 6th, they refer to them as heroes. Some of them say they want to be -- they want to see them, you know, pardoned. I just think it is just completely contrary to anything I've seen and you have seen in our lifetime in terms of a national position to take. Yes. Well, first of all, the Black community has had my back. That's why I got involved in politics. You know, Al, one of the few people know -- The largest Black population in America here in the state of Delaware, as a percent of population, has been the source of my strength. And that's what got me involved in politics in the first place. I made a -- I made a number of promises. Number one, I said I'm going to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court -- woman on the court. We did it. And we did it in a way that -- with the great help of Ketanji Brown Jackson. We did it, and a great help from the senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin. We found ourselves in a situation where I said I want the bench to look more like the country. Al, we have appointed -- I have appointed more appellate court justices on this -- on the federal court system than every other president combined, and even Black women. I said that I was going to forgive some student debt. I was going to help HBCUs. HBCUs have as many qualified student as any other institution. But what the problem -- they don't -- they don't have endowments. So, they don't have the laboratories. They don't have the places where the jobs of the future are going to be, you know, from the high-tech jobs. Well, guess what? We got some $5 billion, and we're not stopping now. And, you know, the idea is that, in terms of the crime, you know, every Republican who voted against my rescue plan, which gave billions of dollars directly to cities and states with the flexibility leaning toward community programs, directed toward crime prevention, they're the reason why they kept good cops on the beat. And -- and the other thing I did, I made sure that although I couldn't get the -- the -- the legislation passed, the George Floyd legislation passed, I'm coming back at it. But I -- I just initiated, by executive order, at the federal level. No chokeholds, no no-knock warrants. I was able to do it at a federal level. And look, the other thing is, Al, you know, we've talked about this. And every Black person understands this, that Black crime is one that, in fact, are the victims of the crime. They're in -- they're in their communities. And they -- they want help to retrain the way we train police. We have to train police to be able -- and we need more social workers. We need more psychologists. We need more people with mental health backgrounds in -- on police forces so that we don't just have the guy come in a -- you know, we -- we don't -- for example, we don't have up-armored Humvees rolling in the neighborhoods anymore, and that's not going to happen on my watch. And so, in addition to that, what we've done is we've provided -- you know, Black employment is way up. We've provided loans for small businesses and housing for young Blacks who are just starting, who need -- who need the -- the down payment. We've -- I provided the student loan benefits, commit 20,000 bucks to student loan forgiveness. If, in fact, you went to a school with a -- with not just $10,000, but another $10,000 if you had a Pell Grant. What I've done with regard to the -- you know, dealing with the -- not just a course, but also with the notion of what we're going to do to provide for opportunities for Black Americans. I said that I was going to make sure my -- my administration look like America. We have more African Americans in high positions, both on the cabinet -- in the cabinet, as well as throughout my administration. And I'm still working on doing even more. The bottom line is everything we've done has been designed to help the community and other communities like the Black communities, the Hispanic communities in a similar situation. And it's about time that we gave the kind of help we need. And every single thing that I've proposed, with virtually one or two exceptions, the Republican Party has been against it. And guess what? Their whole proposal, if they win and take back the House and the Senate is to do away with all the things that I've said. Not a joke. Do away with all the things that I've said. They don't want student debt going through. They don't -- forgiveness. They don't want to see where we go in Black HBCU. They don't want -- like the fact that I was able to cut the cost of prescriptions for starting in the 1st of the year. Any senior that is in -- that has -- will never have to pay more than $2,000 a year for Medicare for all their drugs, even the $10,000; $12,000; $14,000 year. I've -- I've made -- delisted the -- not -- I've seen to it that anyone that's in jail for mere possession of marijuana has that wiped off their record. And if they're out of jail -- look, first of all, they're no longer in jail. And two, if they're out of jail, their record gets wiped clean because they don't have a shot. And everybody, for example, getting out of prison should be able to, once they serve their time, qualify for all the programs from Pell Grant, to housing, to the whole range of things. We're going to give people a chance. Give a chance, that's all they're looking for is a chance. And -- and -- that's -- that's what I'm -- I have great confidence in the leadership of the African American community. I really do, Al. You've -- you've -- anyway, I'm -- I'm sorry to get so -- That's right. Al, look, you are, all those groups are my -- are the salvation of this country in terms of hate and crime. I mean it sincerely. You know, you and other civil rights leaders came to the White House. You laid out your cares and concerns as a -- and the AA community, the -- and the door is always open. You know, I said in the beginning. You knew I meant it. A lot of people didn't know me as well were surprised. The door at the White House is always open. That matters of -- and policies have directly benefited the African American community and other minority communities. Look, we are -- we just have such opportunities if we just step up. My concern in this election, though, is, if we don't win, they're going to wipe out everything we've done. I'll be able to veto some of this stuff, but some of it's going to wipe out. It's going to go away. And it makes no sense. You know, voting rights -- and I prioritized that issue on -- from day one. Department of Justice says, ""Double the voting rights staff,"" has challenging provisions in the state restrictions in Georgia, Arizona, Texas. We've launched a task force on the 21st to combat threats against election workers. You know, I want to be clear. America should feel safe going to the polls. Did you ever think, Al, you would see -- I guess you may have because you've seen it in the South and during the civil rights movement, where you have people sitting outside the polling place, and then they are 14, 15 -- It's outrageous. It's outrageous. Well -- Thanks, Al. Thanks a lot. Keep it going, Al."
Joe Biden,"Sure, happy to. Well, I'm making choices. It's an interesting question. I'm making choices like I always have, in the sense that circumstances change but my objective doesn't change. Does that make sense to you? For example, I have, uh, from the time I've entered public life, it's been about how to give ordinary working-class and middle-class folks a shot [Inaudible] -- instead of everything being viewed as from the top down. I'm not a big, -- [References a recording device] is it working? I'm not a big believer in trickle-down economy, and, um, and so everything I look at from the time I took this office, but even before that when I was a senator all those years, is what's the best shot to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out because when that happens everybody does well. The wealthy do very, very well. And the biggest thing I think that, when I came into this job, that I have the greatest frustration with the last four years, is that, um, uh, everything was constructed and built and arranged in order for the top 1 to 3% of the population to do very well. The rest was sort of, I mean that literally, everything else seemed to be an afterthought. Well, if you notice, until gas prices started going up, which was about the same time, the University of Michigan survey, they had a very different view. Things were much more, they were much more optimistic. We came in and we started to grow the economy in significant ways. We were able to, ah, you know, go from 2 million shots in arms to 225 million. People were having access to dealing with the pandemic. We started opening up businesses, and opening up access to go back to work, etc. But then, in my experience, the way I was raised, if you want a direct barometer of what people are going to talk about at the kitchen table and the dining room table and whether things are going well, it's the cost of food and what's the cost of, of gasoline at the pump. I mean literally at the pump. And if you notice, you know, uh, gasoline went up a, you know, $1.25 right off the bat, almost, when, the, Putin's war started. Um, and as I said at the time, by the way, I made it clear with helping Ukraine, and organizing NATO to help Ukraine, that this was going to cost. There was going to be a price to pay for it. It was, this is not going to be cost-free, but we had, the option of doing nothing was worse. If he in fact moved into Ukraine, took hold of Ukraine, and Belarus, where it is, and he's been a threat to NATO, all those things would have even been more dire. Sure. Sure. I'm the president of the United States. It's not about my political survival. It's about what's best for the country. No kidding. No kidding. So what happens? What happens if the strongest power, NATO, an organizational structure we put together, walked away from Russian aggression of over 100,000 troops marching across a border to try to, to occupy and wipe out a culture of an entire people. What, then, then what happens? What happens next? What do we do next? Oh, I fear what would happen next is you'd see chaos in Europe. You would see the possibility they continue to move. You already saw what they're doing in Belarus. What would happen in the surrounding countries. Watch what would happen in Poland, and, and the Czech Republic and all the members of NATO. For example, you know, the reason Putin said he was going to go in was because he didn't want them to join NATO. And, uh, he, he, he, he wanted the sort of the Finland-ization of NATO. He got the NATO-ization of Finland, instead. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. And so, the idea that if the United States stood by, then what does China think about Taiwan? Then what does North Korea think about nuclear weapons beyond testing and pressure? No, I don't. But I don't think, look, on a daily basis, most households just trying to figure out how to put, before, even when things were going well, just figure out how to put food on the table, take care of the kids, pay for their education, just basic things. You know, look, um, one of the, I've always suggested to younger people that want to get into public life, I ask them two things: Have you figured out what's worth losing over? Have you figured out what's worth losing over? If you haven't figured that out, don't get in politics. Go into a more profitable org, enterprise. Go into business, go into commerce, don't, be engaged. But unless you know what's worth losing over, don't get engaged. Number one. Number two. The purpose of public service is to promote views that you think are best for the American people. I made a commitment and I think I can say that I've never broken, if I make a commitment. I wasn't going to run again, this time. I mean for real. I was not going to run. I just lost my son, I was teaching at Penn, I liked it, until all those guys came, come out of the woods -- -- the Charlottesville folks and this other guy said ""good people on both sides"" when an innocent woman was killed, etc. And, I made a decision. I've been doing this too long to do anything other than to try to do what was right. I mean, I'm not, there's nothing noble about it. But it's not worth it. So, you asked me what would I say to the American people. I'd say to the American people I've done foreign policy my whole career. I'm convinced that if we let Russia roll and Putin roll, he wouldn't stop. Zero evidence of that. Zero evidence of that, number one. Number two, we've reduced the deficit by $350 billion last year. We reduced the deficit by a trillion, 700 billion this year. We grow the economy. Today, today, we have more people employed than, in a long, long time and we gained another 8.6 million jobs. And guess what? We still have hundreds of thousands of job openings. -- Yeah, they apprised me. Now you just said two different things. You said Republicans said I caused inflation. She said it may have a marginal impact on it. Two different things. You could argue whether it had a marginal, minor impact on inflation. I don't think it did. And most economists do not think it did. But the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre. Sure. They shouldn't believe a warning. They should just say: ""Let's see. Let's see, which is correct."" And from my perspective, you talked about a recession. First of all, it's not inevitable. Secondly, we're in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. It's bad. Isn't it kind of interesting? If it's my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I'm not being a wise guy. Someone should ask themself that question. Why? Why is it? If it's a consequence of our spending, we've reduced the deficit. We've increased employment, increased pay. There was a survey done uh, uh, by the, uh, I forget which one it was, which one it was now, about three months ago. You had more people had lower debt [Inaudible] credit cards, more savings in their savings account, higher pay in the job they had, more satisfaction in the job they had and they were in good shape financially. Well, two things. Well, I think the paradox is, part of it is, I think what, the failure of the last administration to act on COVID had a profound impact on the number of people who got COVID and the number of people who died. Now here's what I'm, I think Vivek Murthy is right and most of the international and National Psychological Association, whatever it's, people are really, really down. They're really down. Their need for mental health in America has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset. Everything they counted on upset. But most of it's a consequence of, of, of what's happening, what happened is a consequence of the, the COVID crisis. People lost their jobs. People are out of their jobs. And then, were they going to get back to work? Schools were closed. Think of this. I think we vastly underestimate this. If you had, and instead of your child being, how old, five? Five years old. If your child had been 17 years old two years ago. Well get ready, man. Boy or girl? Well I'll tell you what, she's gonna, she's going to be crazy about you until about age 13. And then hang on. But all kidding aside, here's the deal. Think about what it's like for the graduating classes of the last three years. No proms. No graduation. No, no, none of the things that celebrate who we are. Think about it across the board. How isolated we've become. How separated we've become. Even practical questions like, you know, can you go out on a date? I mean [Inaudible] the normal socialization, how does that take place? There's overwhelming evidence it's had a profound impact on the psyche of parents, children, across the board. And we lost a million people. And nine for every, according to a study, of those million people, nine significant family or close friends were left alive after they're gone. Yes. Be confident. Be confident. Be confident. Because I am confident. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact. Look, I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than anybody, any other world leader. Imagine — let me put it — let me ask you a rhetorical question, and, you know, I mean, obviously you don't have to answer any of the questions. No no. No no no. But think of this. Name me a single major company, country in the world where that world leader wouldn't trade places with my problems for his in a heartbeat. Name me one. Not a joke. There are none. No, Switzerland has their own problems right now. When I said major, I meant major power, so — but, no. I mean, you know, I just had the, the American, you know, the whole hemisphere, beautiful countries in the Caribbean and beautiful countries that are, have, that are middle-class countries that are having serious problems. Everybody's having them. In the meantime, we have a little thing called climate change going on. And it's having profound impacts. We got the tundra melting. We've got the North Pole, I mean, so people are looking and, and I think it's totally understandable that they are worried because they look around and see, ""My God, everything is changing."" We have more hurricanes and tornadoes and flooding. People saw what — I took my kids years ago to Yellowstone Park. They call me, ""Daddy did you see what happened at Yellowstone, right?"" Well, it's unthinkable. These are 1,000-year kinds of events. Sure. Well, I say in the short term, do the right thing. Instead of, you know, they've made 315 or 16 billion, 35 billion dollars, these major oil companies in the first quarter. So I think it's three, twelve, five -- I don't know how many times [Inaudible]. Don't buy back your own stock. Don't, don't just reward yourselves. I mean, look, here's what. A lot happened. One of the things I ran on when I was running is that I, I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware. More corporations incorporated in my state than all the rest of the United States combined. Not a joke. Literally. And, you know, they try to make me, my fr—, the MAGA party, tries to make me out to be this socialist. I got elected seven times, not just six, seven times, in that state. But one of the things that's changed is the notion of what constitutes corporate responsibility. The fact that you're in a situation where you have a Fortune 500 company, you got 55 paid zero taxes, made 40 billion dollars. Those surveys also show nobody, including Republicans in suburbia, think the tax system is fair. Billionaires paying 8%. All these things that are occurring that have to be shifted. It used to be, for example, I'll give you one example. It used to, am I holding up? OK. Yes. Yes. I think it's changing. Well, first of all, I had the votes. If I had told you [Inaudible] -- You're not doing [Inaudible]. I'm impressed by your objectivity, how you write. I'm not being, I shouldn't say that on the record because then you'll get in trouble. But all kidding aside. Usually [Inaudible] the question I get asked in the beginning with the Recovery Act: Can you get this passed? How can you possibly do that? I got 1.9 trillion dollars. Saved the economy. It used to be long lines, people in nice cars like we drive. Lined up just to get a box of food in their trunk. People getting kicked out onto the street because they couldn't pay the rent. Thousands and thousands of people. And guess what? It worked. Secondly, no, here's the important point. The second piece of this is, that it also saw to it that we were able to provide for the funding for COVID, not only, not only the shots and the shots in arms, but also all the hospital costs. We were able to reduce the cost of insurance. My point is, people would say, ""How can you get that done?"" If I did, if any other president just passed that act, and the infrastructure bill, they'd say, ""God almighty."" Name me a president that's done anything like that before. At the same time. That's right. Yep. Sure they want to know. And on that answer is no. Not one single Republican, not one, not one, would vote to extend it. We're 50/50 and we lost one Democrat vote. So I'm one vote short on that piece. But for example, I'm going to be able to get, God willing, the ability to pay for prescription drugs. There's more than one way to bring down the cost for working folks. Gasoline may be up to $5 a gallon, but somebody who has a child with stage two diabetes is paying up to a thousand bucks a month for the insulin. We can reduce it to 35 bucks a month and get it done. We have the votes to do it. We're gonna get that done. That kinda thing. I can't get it all done. That's why I need the [Inaudible] vote. One more thing. Let's look at what our Republican friends are going to have to face with the Supreme Court decision on Roe. What they're going to have to face in terms of the Supreme Court —the failure, the failure of this Republican Party to be willing to do anything to deal with the basic social concerns of the country. And so, I think, you know, I fully understand why the average voter out there is just confused and upset and worried. And they're worried, for example, you know, can they send their kid back to, back to college? What's going to happen? Are we going to take away the ability of people to borrow? So I think there's a lot of reasons for people to want to know what comes next. And do I have the votes? I believe I have the votes to do a number of things. One, prescription drugs. Reduce utility bills by providing for, uh, I think, we'll be able to get the ability to have a tax incentive for winterization, which would, they estimate, bring down the average bill for the family, normal home, 500 bucks a year. I think we would be able, we're gonna get another $57 billion for semiconductors, so we don't have the supply chain problem we had before, keeping down the cost of vehicles. I think we're going to be in a situation where, we're gonna — I know we are — where we're going to reduce a person's average internet bill by 30 bucks a month, because we have the money through the, through the uh, uh, infrastructure bill to provide internet across country. I think we're going to be able to have a fair tax system, to have the votes, it's going to be close, to have a minimum tax on corporations of 15%, make sure we're in a situation where the people who in fact are, the idea that a billionaire is paying 8% of income and a teacher is paying 22%. I think we're going to be able to get tax increases on super wealthy. Not a lot. Not a lot. I'm a capitalist. You should be able to [Inaudible]. For God's sake, pay your fair share. Just pay, pay a piece of what you owe. And I think we're gonna be able to do those kinds of things. I know I'm supposed to go. That's the last question. Well, my predecessor on the wall didn't pass the [Inaudible] his first year, number one. Number two, the reason -- you know why that predecessor is on the wall. You never saw his picture in this office before. I asked my brother to put together the office for me — decide what desk I'd have. I didn't realize the outgoing president had to be out 10 o'clock, the incoming president by 2 o'clock. And you pick what you want and you got to get it all in by then. So I [Inaudible] Jon Meacham come in and he set my office up for me, and so the desk they picked, and you know everything, everything except the wallpaper. And I used to, I came in here for eight years in a row as the vice president. George Washington's photograph is over there. And I looked and I said, ""Why Franklin Roosevelt?"" Not that I don't like Franklin Roosevelt, but why put that big portrait of Franklin Roosevelt? And Jon Meacham said, ""Because no one ever inherited that kind of big circumstances and dire, more dire straits than he did that last time."" I said, ""Oh, that's encouraging."" And I said, ""Why Abraham Lincoln?"" And he said, ""The country's never been as divided since the Civil War."" I knew those two things coming in. But what I also believed was I could get some of it done. There was a, I just was reading an article [Inaudible] that article by the, uh, the guy talking about Biden and how he brought the country, brought Republicans together, Republicans and Democrats. Anyway, I'll, I'll get it to you. I'll find it. Oh, here you go. New York Times Magazine. That's factually correct. Now, there's a lot I couldn't get done. Well, yeah. By the way, And when you remember, I called for that, everybody said, ""Oh, no, no no."" But guess what? It's gonna pass. But my generic point is that, you know, we're going to get gun safety. We're not going to get what I wanted. We're gonna get a part where everybody, we're gonna get the, uh, the uh, uh, the, the Innovation Competition Act, a hundred million bucks is going to be invested outside of Cleveland by Intel. We're going to have another 57 mil -- . You know, there's forced arbitration I got rid of in sexual orientation, sexual harassment cases. Juneteenth I got passed, no one said it could be done. I'm not saying, ""Look at all I've done."" But I knew that were probably, probably 15 sort of traditional, mainstream, conservative Republicans left. And I include in that — and I'm going to get myself in trouble, and I'll get him in trouble, probably — but the minority leader from Kentucky. He's a solid, mainstream guy. But you have the, ah, the folks from Texas. You have a lot of folks who are very, very MAGA. For example, Johnson, you know, and Scott, they're. Every five years, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid go out of existence. You've got to build them back. They, these guys mean it. I mean, why in the hell did you ever think that would happen in your lifetime, and you're a young man? Well, I tell you what, well at least you're keeping it. I'd settle for orange if I had more hair. But all kidding aside, I think this is a process and I think what you're going to see this election is people voting their overall concerns as well. Even people who are not pro-choice are going to find it really, really off the wall when a woman goes across a state line and she gets arrested [Inaudible] where she's doing. Even people who are, you know, I mean, there's so many things these guys are doing that are out of the mainstream of where the public is. And I think — but it is, I knew I was stepping into a difficult moment, but — Can I say something off the record?"
Joe Biden,"You're making me famous with my granddaughters, you guys. I -- I -- Oh, no, it's an honor to be on. I mean, what -- what you guys did to lift people's spirits is important. It's been a tough time. I got a lot of great theater. Well, I know Trump. A lot of theater. And by the way, you did. No, no. I don't think it was a quote. But look, I -- but it's the truth. You know, people are afraid of what they don't know. And they're -- they're frightened of it. And they had images that every gay person in the world or lesbian was an extremist on everything. I mean, it's -- But it's like -- Well, that's true -- By the way. No, no, but -- but think -- think about it. You know, the first -- you made it clear that a gay person's interest and -- and life is not any fundamentally different. I mean, they have the same fears, concerns, ambitions, likes. I mean -- It's normal. Yeah, well, the honest-to-God truth is it's a joke among my granddaughters who -- very little. When I have time on television, what I tend to do is I tend to -- Watch sports or watch the news. And by the way, I don't work harder. A lot of people work a hell a lot harder than I do. But -- but there's just not that many hours. Do you know what I mean? Oh, come on. Well, my staff is laughing. They're behind you. Now, that's one of the things Jill and I are working out. And I mean this sincerely. Jill, because she teaches full time -- Is in bed by 9:30, and -- and I used to go to bed 9:30, 10 o'clock, and we talk before we go to sleep. I mean, we -- we spend time together. But now, I don't get back to my -- even in the White House, I don't get from the Oval Office into my -- in the residence -- Until usually around 7 o'clock. We have dinner. And then I have -- and I'm not -- not a complaint. I give my word, but I have a briefing book that is probably 200 pages. I mean, a big binder like that. No, but -- but worst part, you guys got to memorize your lines. But all kidding aside, so I -- I usually get in bed around 11 o'clock. Jill gets up at 6:30 and goes -- works out. I get up at 8 o'clock and work out. Yes. Well, we -- we just have to do it because she's worked so long as well. So, we just set time, and I tell Annie, who runs the show for me and my -- and my chief of staff, I'm not doing anything. And so, Jill and I -- but it's -- they're -- they're getting further apart. I mean, in the sense. But usually, we try to do that. We go to Camp David or -- or go back to our house in Delaware, which is secluded enough off the road, that we just, you know, and -- Well, yeah. No. Well, there's certain things that -- I mean, like with the war in Ukraine, there's a lot of really -- But no, I'm always available, but I -- Well, here's what I do. My -- my -- my worst part is I -- they -- they kid me and everybody kids me. I'm -- I'm one of those practicing Catholics. My mother come down from heaven if I didn't. But I go to -- I go to -- I don't want to tell everybody because I'll be there. But I -- I go to 5 o'clock mass in my local church. Or I go to -- in Washington, I go over to Georgetown to the [Inaudible] And I go to -- there's a 5:00 -- well, there's a 4:30 mass, and I go to mass on Saturday. And then Sunday, I -- we just try to -- try to do nothing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, my No. 1 sport is football. But it's changed so much. I -- I was a relatively good ballplayer and -- A high scorer. I was a flanker back, a halfback. And -- And -- yeah. But it's a sport that I -- that I watch probably more than any other [Inaudible] Now -- I used to be pretty good. I haven't played golf on three -- Off the tee. Well, yeah. Three years ago, I did. I haven't played much. We added up, they figured out that I try to -- when I -- when I'm home in Delaware, it was a place I can go where I can play -- it's a -- it's a private club. It's called Fieldstone. But I -- I play -- all of this is golf, and I get in. I've -- I've not played 18 holes lately. I've nine holes and -- By the way, there's a lot of national debate about that. Yeah, there is about [Inaudible] By the way, that's my best recreation, my granddaughters. They're crazy about me. I know you think I'm kidding. [Crosstalk] Every single day, I contact every one of my grandchildren. Air Force One. Well, the good news is the plane never leaves until I get there now. You know. Sean, I'll take you through it. You guys -- No, I'm serious. Happy to share [Inaudible] Well, I do. Look, guys, I had no intention to run for president again. For real. Or running for office. I was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, enjoying it, and put together an institute up there. And -- and when those folks came out of the fields, literally carrying torches down in Charlottesville, and the last guy said, ""There are good people on both sides,"" and that young woman was killed, I realized that -- that we are at an inflection point in history. And it occurs every three, five, seven generations that what happens in the near term, in this case, the next two to three, five years, the last several years, is going to determine what it looks like for the next several generations. And -- and -- and the context was my -- my son had just died. And so, we have a tradition in our family. Anyone in the family, any kid can ask for a family meeting. This is dead serious. I'm not joking about this, as well as my -- my dad's family when I was growing up. And so, I got a call from my oldest granddaughter and saying, ""Pop, we want to have a family meeting."" She was a freshman -- either a senior at Penn or a freshman at Columbia Law. And then my other granddaughter, Finnegan Biden. She's a brilliant kid. She's a wonderful kid. She's my secret weapon. She was, I think, a sophomore at Penn. And anyway -- Well, I -- no, I don't mean that. I meant they were close to me [Inaudible] from my house. And -- and then I had another granddaughter who was a senior in high school and then a granddaughter who was a sophomore in high school and a -- and a grandson who was, I'm thinking, seventh or eighth grade. And they came in, and they sat down, and they said, ""Pop, you really should run."" And I didn't want to run because I knew it was going to be ugly. And keep in mind, just like your -- your children in the show business, what with you in show business, they get used to the barbs, they get used to the accolades. And so, they've been their whole life, either I've been a vice president or a senator and their dad or uncle had been attorney general and so on. And so, they said, ""You got to run, Pop."" Pop -- they call me pop. They said, ""Pop, Uncle Beau wants you to run. Daddy wants you to run."" Etc. And I said, ""Well, it's going to be not -- it's not going to be very nice, honey."" And my little guy, little Hunter, he's now 16 years old. Wonderful kid. He took out his cellphone. He said, ""Here's a picture, Pop. We know."" And he showed me a picture. My wife hates me telling this story, but it's true. And it was a picture was me walking out of the -- out of the cathedral with my hand on my son's flag-draped coffin, the military escort, and my arm around him like I used to hold his dad to just reassure. We're walking out. And the caption at the bottom said that Biden molests another child. And they said, ""We know it's going to be tough."" But here's the point about your question. I think the biggest thing that's changed is technology. There are no editors anymore. And so, you know, I -- you know, there's a lot been written, and I started to write a book about it, but I don't, obviously, have the time to do it now, that if you go all the way back to Gutenberg and the printing press, it changed the nature of the world and how nations got along. No -- no. Well, I know. But look -- look, I'm -- I'm getting the television. But think about how things have changed. In every new technological change, it changed the way we interface with one another. Whether it was the telegraph or the radio and then television. But now, the internet, for the first time, there's no editors. There's no editors at all. And so, how does somebody know what is true? Oh, if I defect, I'm going to Canada. Well, look, that's -- that's true. And -- and if you notice, the generic polling about the American public, they're 40, 50, 60 percent are worried about the survival of democracy. But it's not just here. It's all around the world -- This notion of can -- you know, democracy, can it be sustained? But I'm optimistic, and I really am. No, but I -- I genuinely am because this younger generation, the ones you speak to up to -- I say up to 30 when I talk about the younger generation. No, I'm not being facetious. I'm being deadly earnest. Is the best educated, the most open, the least prejudiced, the most giving generation in American history. And -- and we're going to break through this. We really, truly are. And you think about the things that how ugly things have gotten. But think about how much we've gotten done. I mean, did -- you know, when I ran, I said I was running for three reasons: to restore the soul of America; to rebuild the middle class, and because when the economy is built from the middle out, the poor do have a road up and the wealthy still do very well; and to -- and to unite the country. The third part's being the hardest because I went through my career as being the guy who got a lot done with Democrats and Republicans for all those years I was in the Senate. Hell, I was there for 36 [Inaudible] Yeah. And -- and I -- and what's got me involved was the -- I came from a state, to its great shame, was segregated by law. And -- and we have the eighth largest Black population in America. And I was really moved by the Civil Rights Movement as a kid. And I remember, we moved down from Scranton, Pennsylvania when coal died. My dad was not a coal miner, but he was a salesperson. And we moved back to this little town called Claymont, Delaware, and it used to be a big steel town. And we lived in what became projects, but at the time, they were apartment complexes that were modest compared to where we had lived. And I went to a little Catholic school called Holy Rosary, and it was across the street from the -- the fire station there. And I remember, my mom used to drive us up to school, I was in third grade, and drop us in the parking lot to go into school. And I see this bus go by all the time with only, then we -- we referred to as colored, but Black children in it. I didn't understand it. Because I didn't know it. There were hardly any Black people in -- in Scranton. And what was that all about? And said, well, they're not allowed to go to school, honey. They're not allowed to go to the public schools here. And then I ended up being the only white employee in the east side of Wilmington, which is 98% African American. I was a lifeguard there. Then I got involved, and -- and that's what got me engaged. Well -- well, it was. But I also was very angry. I mean, it made me angry. And like -- like a lot of folks of my generation, and I never -- I love reading how I knew I was going to run for president and I knew I was going to be, and so I wasn't even hell -- I wasn't even old enough. I mean, I'll never forget. I was -- I got really involved trying to bring the Democratic Party in Delaware into the mainstream of Northeastern Democrats. It was more a Southern Democratic Party. You know, southern part of my state, the Delmarva Peninsula, talk -- gets like this. A lot of -- it's just very southern. For real. Yeah. Like, actually, it goes north-south. Most people don't realize that, but yes, it is. And the end -- the end result of all that was that I got involved. I -- I was a young lawyer. I went to law school, and I went to work for a guy who was a local. He was a state rep. He was a great trial lawyer. And -- and one thing led to another. And they tried to reform the Democratic Party to make it more -- I mean, the Republican Party was more liberal than the Democratic Party at the time. It was the Rockefeller Republicans. Anyway, to make a long story not quite so long and boring, I was asked to help put together a group of young people to get someone to run for the United States Senate. And I kept working on it. And I went to an off-year convention in Dover, you know, the Democratic convention. And I was -- it was between the evening -- the afternoon and evening session. And I was in a motel -- small motel down there, shaving. And I was in the bathroom, and I had a towel on and shaving cream. And they're just banging the door. And I opened the door and there's four leading Democrats, two of which I never met before, two former governors and a state chairman and a head of the Supreme Court who had retired and a family with more senators than any family in American history, the tunnels. And -- and I was -- I thought it was the guys I drove -- drove down with. I was 27 -- 28 years old. And they said, ""We got to talk to you, Joe."" We just had a dinner together. And I said, ""OK, gentlemen."" I walked in and quickly got in the bathroom thinking there was a towel. [Inaudible] I wiped the shaving cream off my face, came out. You know, those desks that are nailed to the wall, headboard is nailed, and I'm leaning against the desk, and they said, ""Joe, we were thinking, you should run for the Senate."" I said, ""Oh."" I said no -- I said -- No, no. No, I'm serious. It's a true story. And the chief justice -- the former justice said -- I said, ""I'm not old enough, sir."" He said, ""You obviously didn't do well in constitutional law, Joe."" Said, ""You don't have to be 30 to get elected. You had to be 30 to be sworn in."" And I remember going home, and I don't know if you guys ever did this, but I had a great professor in -- in college. No. But, I mean, there was a guy that -- I wasn't a good student either if you're implying they weren't. But -- but here's the point, I -- I'm riding home, and I stopped at the University of Delaware the next day. I had a professor named David Ingersoll. He was my political philosophy professor. And I said -- I said, ""They just asked me. This is crazy."" And he looked at me and said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said?"" And I'm thinking, what the hell did Plato say? And he said, to paraphrase, the penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves. And it was the middle of Vietnam War, and a lot of other things going on. One thing led to another. Yeah. You know, because I got elected so young, everybody thought there had to be some secret sauce I had. I -- you know, there must have been something. And so, I've had -- just about everybody has ever sought the office of the Senate or governor, a young person in the last 40 years of the country say, you know, what -- what is it? And I say the same thing in the media from the bottom of my heart. I said, figure out what are you willing to lose over. Or don't get involved because if you don't know what you're willing to lose over and have something that important to you, don't get engaged, don't get involved running because you can make a lot of money and do a lot better doing other things than being in politics. And so, one of the things that does is that -- you know, there's a joke among my colleagues when I said it, no one ever doubts I mean what I say. The problem is I sometimes say all that I mean. I -- I get a staff call. I have an alarm, but they -- they don't trust that. So, I mean, my -- my routine is there's a great guy who used to be a physical therapist at the -- at the White House. Now, he comes in, and I -- Yeah, I -- he rocks me. I tell you what, he works me. When I go up, there's a gym upstairs. And so, I -- 8 o'clock -- I'm up at 7:00 -- 7:15. I go up and work out from 8:00 until quarter to 9:00. Yes, as a matter of fact. Well, I feel good. I feel good. I -- the thing I learned, the difference in age, if I let it go for a week, I'd feel it. Wait. No, I used to be able to go for a week and nothing would change. And I was like -- No, I'm serious. Chocolate chip. I was dull as hell. I'm known for my Ray-Ban sunglasses and chocolate chip ice cream. That's a hell of a -- Oh, by the way, all those years -- when I ran for the first time for the Senate, I had -- I had been up to that point, even though I was a practicing lawyer, in order to get free rent, there was a country swimming club that had 17 acres, a little tiny house on it -- And they let us live in the house as long as I would hire all the pool people, right? But all -- from the time I was 16 years old as a lifeguard, I -- it's all I ever did. So, the headline was, you don't want this guy. The only job he's ever had is a lifeguard. I'm serious. I like coconut. Coconut and custard pie. Me. Yeah. No, I have -- I guess I have a -- I have -- I have probably less than 15 -- But more than -- more than 14. A lot of ties. Yeah. Yeah. Well -- well, she is if -- if I'm not -- Oh, Jill's -- no, Jill is fine. Jill -- Jill is fine. Joe is fine. All kidding aside. No, no. No, no. And -- but it's a -- she is -- gets very upset if I have not fully shaven or all this -- this excessive amount of hair I have. You know what I mean? There's a lot of hope. There's a lot of hope because two things. For example, I'm out here -- Well, I'm out here today with Congresswoman Bass -- Karen Bass -- And I go over. They have a rapid transit system here that needs a lot of work. Well, we're going to spend $9 billion making a change. But here's the deal. It's estimated to take 124,000 tons out of the air. Let me back up. If people have a chance to get on a track train. And can make it quicker than they can drive in the car, they -- they take the train. And -- and I'm a big train guy, and I -- we've gotten billions of dollars more from -- we're spending more in Amtrak than Amtrak initially was spent, and it's all just getting underway. But it's fundamental changes that are going to be taking place. And -- Oh, yeah. Oh, I know. And this is going to be -- it's going to be a game-changer. It's going to take -- And by the way, in addition to the $368 billion for climate in that bill, we also have over $1.2 trillion that we got passed in the -- in the act having to do with dealing with the infrastructure. We -- we used to rank No. 1 in the world in infrastructure. We're No. 13, for God's sake. We used to -- I mean -- A lot of jobs. Literally, we've created more jobs in the first 18 months than any president in history, 700,000 manufacturing jobs. Where the hell does it say America can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? No. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Well, you know why it got lost? We used to spend 2 percent of our GDP on research and development as a nation. We're down to 0.7 percent. China's -- other countries are passing us by. But now, we're going back to -- look, my major goal in terms of the economy was to change the dynamic of trickle-down economy to building from the middle out, bottom up, and doing it that way. And I know I get criticized and understandably for being ""the most pro-union president in history."" Well, the reason for that is these union folks, everybody thinks you show up on a job and you can be a technician. Guess what? You take four or five years, like going back to college. It's like going to school. They're the best in the world. They're the best in the world. And they're -- ultimately, it's cheaper for us. So, there's a lot we're doing. And for example, we -- we're going to invest literally several hundred billion dollars in building chips or computers. We invented them. We invented them. So, anyway -- By the way -- by the way, the point you're making is the point. People have to vote. But look, you saw -- I mean, the best example is the Supreme Court in the Dobbs decision -- Said -- there's a line from one of the justices saying women have a right to vote. We'll see -- but basically, we'll see if they do. You saw what happened in Tennessee. Women showed up and vote. Women are out-registering men for the first time significantly for this new election. Oh, that -- that was immediate. And so, my generic point is, I think people, particularly younger people, that's where I'm spending most of my time trying to focus on, people under 30. They, in fact, understand that vote matters. What I worry about -- I worry about the states that have the election deniers in them making it harder practically for them to vote. That's what I worry about, the Supreme Court decisions on voting that are coming down -- that are going to be coming down. And so -- but vote, vote, vote. That's been my -- I end all my speeches, everything I talk about. For me to do what you're suggesting, my -- I imagine it would end up being a gigantic fight, whether I was using an emergency system designed to save ""lives"" for political purposes. It's not. Well, guess what? Well, it's great. But guess what? The whole idea is the other team doesn't want people to vote. They don't want open voting. They don't want to be able to mail-in ballots. They don't want -- Well, we're praying to try to put that card. I'm serious, Jason. You're right. You gave them hope. Look, guys, two things are going to go down in history. Number one, more than a million people died. A million people died. And the estimates are those million people had nine close related people, whether their family or otherwise. The psychological impact on the nation has been profound. Absolutely profound. And the other thing is, the whole idea that we're moving -- think about this, graduating from -- when you graduated from high school, you had -- you had your prom, you had, you know, the -- the graduation ceremonies you had. What do these kids have? The kids are graduating. What are the things that they, in fact, missed that are consequential? That junior prom, that senior prom, that graduation ceremony. They -- all -- all those parties, all -- I mean, it's like -- and it's like the difference. Everybody asked me what was the most exciting thing when you got elected and so on. You know, I was really honored to be -- I mean, it's the greatest honor in the world. OK? But there was no celebration about it. No, no, but -- but -- but I mean it. And that's not who we are. And the other thing people have to remember, our strength lies in our incredible diversity. It's incredible. Incredible. And other nations are realizing that that's why they want to invest here. That's why they want to get engaged here. Exactly right. And so, there's so much. And by the way, I'm convinced, we're going to be able to do a hell of a lot. Well, the biggest thing I'll say is one more thing. One of the things is that people understand that I understand loss. And I -- I think it's so important that people understand that from that loss, it's never -- the pain never goes away, but you can do incredible things. The person you lost never leaves your heart. I don't know how many times I ask myself, ""What would Beau do?"" I'm not joking. And so, you just -- there's so -- people are genuinely empathetic if you give them a shot. And I think just reaching out to people. Not me president, but just reaching out to people matters. Think of the number of people who are down and out, wonder where in the hell am I going to go. What happens? Well, you guys are giving me more credit [Inaudible] I really do. I am optimistic. I truly am. It does work. It does work. Thank you, guys. No, I really -- I enjoyed it. Thank you. Invite me back."
Joe Biden,"We've purchased several million, already. But here's, right away I think, don't hold me to the number, I think it may be 20 million. But a lot of pills. All they can make so far. But, you know, I hope we don't get there, because if people get the shots, they get their two shots and a booster, they're not going to be in a position where they're going to need such a pill. The answer is, I think it'll be a matter of weeks to a month to get the pills. There won't be enough to get to all the hospitals. We've ordered a lot more of those pills. We have to order millions of those pills. Yup. Yeah. No, I don't think it's a failure. I think it's, you could argue that we should have known a year ago, six months ago, two months ago, a month ago. I've ordered half a billion of the pills, 500 million pills, I mean, excuse me 500 million test kits that are going to be available to be sent to every home in America if anybody wants them. But the answer is, yeah, I wish I had thought about ordering a half-a-billion pills two months ago, before COVID hit, here. No, nothing's been good enough. But look where we are. When, last Christmas, we're in a situation where we had significantly fewer vaccinated -- people vaccinated. Emergency rooms were filled. We had serious backups in hospitals that were causing great difficulties. Um, we're in a situation now where we have 200 million people fully vaccinated, 200 million people fully vaccinated. And we have more than that who have had the one shot, at least one shot, and they're getting these booster shots, as well. So we've moved along, and we've still -- the CDC is still saying, and my, uh, the docs who advise me on this are still saying, if you are tested, if you know where you are in terms of having gotten the shots, there's no reason why you can't get together with your family and your friends. Um, and we couldn't do that last Christmas. That's the safest thing you can do, both shots and a booster. No. We were closer than ever. But there's a lot we don't know. It's like, I'm sure, you're going to ask me: when's this going to end? How are we going to do this? Are we certain we're going to be able to overcome the Delta -- or the, excuse me, the -- uh, the virus, COVID-19. The answer is -- the expectation is yes, because we have the best scientists in the world, we've moved so rapidly compared to other countries, but we don't know. We don't know for certain. So that's why --  Well, look, Omicron only really came on the scene just before Thanksgiving. We weren't talking about Omicron six months ago. But it's just recent. And so, we are chasing Omicron. But the fact of the matter is, you're chasing whatever comes on the scene that hadn't, wasn't there before. And this wasn't there this last summer, for example. How did I get it wrong? Nobody saw it coming. Nobody in the whole world. Who saw it coming? Yes. Sure. It was possible. It's possible there could be other variants that come along. That's possible. But what do you plan for? You plan for what you think is available, that is the most likely threat that exists at the time, and you respond to it. And I think that that's exactly what we've done, and -- for example, Omicron is spreading rapidly, but the death rates are much, much lower than they were. This is not  March of 2020. This is a very different time that we're in now. Yes. I'm doing it almost every day. Yes. Well, they won't be able to do it, the number of tests available, I've ordered half a billion of them for the United States to be sent to - everybody who wants a test can have one sent to home. That's in January. Well, the answer is, the expectation is it will be by, rapid tests will start going out in the beginning of January, because they're being produced now. I listen to the scientists. And I'm sure the scientists are paying very close attention to that. There may be a need for another booster, but that remains to be seen. It remains a possibility. It's been considered, but the recommendation I've gotten, it's not necessary. Even with Omicron. That's the recommendation I got, so far, from the team. Look... Look, let's talk about what we have done. We have passed more major legislation than anybody in their first year ever, ever, ever, ever. And I haven't given up on this. I haven't given up on it. Well, look, I want to get as much as I can possibly get done. As much as we can possibly get done. I still think we'll be able to get a significant amount of what we need to get done, done, particularly as the American people figure out what is in this legislation. It's extremely consequential. Because I -- I made sure -- They are.  They are. If we don't pass, Build Back Better, I think you're right. But if we do -- 17 Nobel laureates in the economy said it's going to bring down inflation if we pass what I'm talking about. It is. I think accountability is necessary. Look -- No matter where it goes. Those responsible should be held accountable. Yes. Yes. That means whatever it takes. Change the Senate rules to accommodate major pieces of legislation without requiring 60 votes. Well, the only thing standing between getting voting rights legislation passed and not getting passed is the filibuster. I support making the exception of voting rights for the filibuster. Yes. But, look, I'm a great respecter of fate. Fate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I'm in the health I'm in now, if I'm in good health, then, in fact, I would run again. You're trying to tempt me, now. [Laughs.] Sure. Why would I not run against Donald Trump if he's nominee? That would increase the prospect of running."
Joe Biden,"[Response submitted in writing] I know people across the country are angry and concerned with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe, which guaranteed the fundamental right to choose. They should be and so am I. A woman's right to choose was settled law for decades. I understand the anger and worry that the Republican Party believes that politicians should be involved in health decisions between a woman and her doctor. It is alarming. We are now on a dangerous path that places politicians at the center of women's private health care decisions and, in some states, criminalizes doctors. Since the Court's decision, Republicans on the state level have continued their assault on women's health by enacting extreme bans on abortion -- even without an exception for rape and incest. But Republicans aren't stopping there. They will pass a federal ban on abortions if they take over Congress. We can't let that happen. You have the power to stop this extremism by voting against Republicans and voting for Democrats to keep control of the House of Representatives and expand our majority in the Senate. With a few more votes in Congress, we can codify Roe and protect your reproductive rights and health. [Response submitted in writing] America needs to lead on climate change. We can't continue with these unprecedented storms, wildfires and droughts that are endangering so many of our fellow Americans. This is why my administration set bold goals to reach a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 and cut our emissions in half by 2030. We passed the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act -- invest hundreds of billions in addressing climate change. These new laws will not only reduce CO2 emissions, but also create good-paying jobs, lower costs for families, modernize our infrastructure, and address historical environmental injustices that have harmed communities across the country. My administration is also standing up to big polluters and wealthy corporations to hold them accountable and make them pay for harming our environment. We set up a new office at the Department of Justice to focus on environmental justice and pollution that has poisoned the air and water in communities. We have a lot of work ahead of us but thanks to these new laws, we have an opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions and build a clean energy economy. [Response submitted in writing] I've heard it from teachers across the country. I heard it from Jill after she taught her own classes for a time over Zoom. I understand the toll COVID has had -- not just on our students, but on our nation's educators and our school communities as a whole. I hear it in the stories Jill shared after teaching on zoom. That's why my administration prioritized putting educators at the front of the line for COVID vaccines, so we could safely get our schools back open and let teachers do what they do best -- teach in classrooms. Through the American Rescue Plan, we also provided $130 billion to help our schools safely reopen, stay open, and to help our students recover. We've encouraged states and districts to use billions of those funds towards teachers' and students' mental health and to support students' learning, so we support you as you support your students. The current teacher shortage did not start with the pandemic -- it exacerbated it. We must respect, recruit, and retain world-class teachers if we want to build a world-class education system. It's unacceptable that so many teachers have to work second jobs just to get by. That's why I've called on states and districts to increase teacher pay, and asked Congress for an additional $20 billion for Title I schools each year, more than doubling current funding, so that these schools can increase teacher pay and compete for the teachers they need, and provide more opportunities for their students. My administration has also urged states to use American Rescue Plan funds to invest in teacher pipeline programs, including programs like residencies and registered teacher apprenticeship programs that allow future teachers to earn a salary while they're preparing to be a teacher, opening up the profession to more people who might be called to be a teacher, but can't afford it. We've called on Congress to provide more federal funding to double down on these investments in teachers. And, under my Administration, we're helping more public service workers like educators get their student debt forgiven through our changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Under my administration, teachers will always have a champion and an ally in the White House. [Response submitted in writing] I know parents across the country have felt the brunt of juggling a pandemic, work, meeting their children's needs, and the reopening of schools. I have heard from moms and dads across the country, and I know the toll you felt these past few years. One of my top priorities when I took office was re-opening our nation's schools and getting kids back in the classroom. We worked quickly to get students back in classrooms safely. Now, we need to help kids catch up. My American Rescue Plan -- which every Republican member of Congress voted against -- included $130 billion to get students back to school safely, to keep them safe, help students recover academically, and provide them the mental health support they need. These funds are being used to hire more tutors, school counselors and social workers, and to provide students with greater access to afterschool and summer programs to help them catch up. A once-in-a-generation pandemic requires a once-in-a-generation response, and my administration is prioritizing this urgent need with actions, not just words. [Response submitted in writing] The idea that kids in many parts of the country learn how to duck and cover at school rather than talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic -- it's not right. It's not who we are. It's not who we should be. Over the last two decades, more school-aged children have died from guns than on-duty police officers and active-duty military combined. Think about that: more kids than on-duty cops killed by guns, more kids than soldiers killed by guns. I am sick and tired of it. And I am trying to fix this. That's why I've taken more executive action on gun violence than any other president at this point in this administration. That's why my administration has issued rules to rein in ghost guns and better regulate stabilizing braces, announced zero tolerance for rogue gun dealers that willfully violate the law, and established strike forces to disrupt the gun trafficking corridors that bring guns from states with lax gun laws into those with strict rules that are desperately trying to stop the violence. It's also why I pushed to secure confirmation of Steve Dettelbach to serve as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- its first confirmed leader since 2015. I've secured funding for ATF and FBI for gun tracing and background checks, and ensured that over $10 billion in American Rescue Plan dollars can be used for public safety. This is why I brought together Republicans and Democrats to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most meaningful gun safety law in nearly 30 years. It closes the boyfriend loophole, funds mental health and red flag law implementation, and provides for enhanced background checks for purchasers under the age of 21. While it doesn't do everything I want, it will save lives. But we have to do more. We must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. It worked before, but Republicans in Congress are afraid of the NRA. They are blocking my ability to take additional steps on this. I have taken on the NRA and the gun lobby and won. If we grow our majorities in Congress, I'll do it again. [Response submitted in writing] We thrive as a nation when working parents have the ability to raise their children and participate in our economy. But, families like yours across the country are struggling to afford and find high-quality child care, making it hard for parents to work. For decades, the costs of child care have rapidly increased and now make up one of the largest costs in family budgets. At the same time, child care providers operating on slim margins have long struggled to attract and retain the staff needed to provide high-quality care at prices parents can afford. Through the American Rescue Plan, my administration provided historic funding to help more than 200,000 child care providers stay open in every corner of the country, and I expanded tax credits to provide families with some breathing room. I have called on Congress to make long-term investments in child care so that working families can access high-quality, affordable child care. [Response submitted in writing] The pandemic had a profound impact on the mental health of Americans across the country -- particularly for our children. And, a tremendous toll has been put on mental health professionals across the country like you. As I said in my State of the Union address last March, we can and must do more to transform how we address mental health in America. First, we need full parity between physical and mental health care. Mental health care is health care, period. My administration released a comprehensive strategy to strengthen our mental health system, improve training and recruiting a diverse pipeline of behavioral health professionals, invest in prevention efforts that help people before they are in a crisis and research new models for treating mental health conditions, support programs to address health worker burnout, and expand community-based mental health crisis response. We also launched the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in July and invested $432 million -- an 18-fold increase in federal support -- to help states prepare for the transition to 988, providing critical resources to help ensure access to trained crisis counselors via phone, chat, and text. Earlier this year, I was proud to sign the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which included historic resources to help address mental health needs across our nation, particularly for young people that have been exposed to violence. [Response submitted in writing] I know Americans across the country are feeling squeezed by the cost of living and it can sometimes feel like there is no end in sight. But we are making progress. Gas prices, for example, have declined over $1.20 since the summer's peak. My number one priority is giving families more breathing room and lowering inflation. To date, my administration has taken steps to lower prescription drug costs, lower health care premiums, tackle energy costs, lower housing costs by boosting production, and tackle junk fees such credit card late fees, overdraft, and bounced check fees. I know that women acting as breadwinners are facing particularly acute caregiving challenges -- through the American Rescue Plan I made historic investments to keep more than 200,000 child care providers open through the pandemic and help more families access long-term care. I also delivered on my campaign promise to forgive up to $10,000 for non-Pell grant recipients, which will lift a crushing lifelong burden for millions of Americans. Since I took office, we have created 10 million jobs -- a record at this point in a presidency. We still have more work to do. But we can't afford a Republican Congress that is campaigning on tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations. Their campaigns are promising policies that will drive up inflation and raise the cost of prescription drugs, health care, and energy. And they are not prioritizing critical investments needed to help families access high-quality, affordable child care and long-term care. This is the wrong approach. [Response submitted in writing] My administration is taking unprecedented steps to secure our border, disrupt criminal smuggling networks preying on vulnerable migrants, and expand legal pathways to the US. There are 23,000 agents and officers and more than 1,200 additional support personnel working to secure our nation's borders. And my administration has seized more illicit fentanyl at our borders than ever before -- just this year, we have seized over 14,000 pounds. With each seizure, we're cutting drug traffickers' profits and saving lives. Instead of advancing solutions, Republicans decided to play political charades by busing and flying asylum seekers across the country under false pretenses and abandoning them on the side of road. My administration is actually addressing the challenge of migration through diplomacy, technology, combatting human smuggling, tackling root causes and expanding safe, legal channels for migration. Since we announced our new Venezuela enforcement policy with Mexico on October 12th, there has been a dramatic drop in Venezuelan border crossings and a significant reduction in busing. This is in stark contrast to the walls, buses, family separation and other inhumane practices employed by the other side. Of course, more can be done to rebuild our immigration system -- which the prior administration gutted -- if Republican elected officials would stop blocking comprehensive immigration reform legislation or obstructing the work we are doing to build a safe, orderly, and humane border processing system. [Response submitted in writing] Our country is at an inflection point and the soul of our nation is at stake. There is no doubt about it. I decided to run for president after Charlottesville to fight the battle for the soul of this nation and unite the country. By that, I meant the core values of who we are as Americans: honesty, decency, and respect. Giving hate no safe harbor. Giving everyone a shot at making it. That was never going to be the work of one election. And, it was never going to be easy. Recently, I held the United We Stand Summit at the White House, where Americans who had been targeted, based on who they are or what they believe, came together to reject hate-fueled violence. We heard from survivors and people who had lost loved ones and are rebuilding their communities after attacks. I announced a series of new actions that my administration is taking, from providing better resources to prevent hate-fueled violence to seeking new funding to protect houses of worship. I signed into law landmark hate crimes legislation. My administration is fighting to end white supremacy and executing the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism. And I signed an executive order during Pride Month to protect LGBTQIA+ people against these hateful attacks. We have more to do. Hate and fear are being given too much oxygen by those who pretend to love America, but who don't understand America. Every other nation is based on ethnicity or geography. In America, we're based on an idea that all people are created equal. We've never lived up to that, but we never before walked away from it. We remain in the battle for the soul of our nation. I know we'll win that battle. I know we'll win it"""
Joe Biden,"Well, they're going to see bridges that didn't exist before, that were shut down. You're going to see -- for example, you're going to be able to get an Amtrak and instead of going through the tunnel of Baltimore at 30 miles an hour because nothing's been done under the Chesapeake Bay for -- under the Baltimore river -- the Baltimore area for 80 years, they're going to be able to go at 100 -- through it at 100 miles an hour. We're going to -- they're going to going to see more -- they're going to see railroads going from Syracuse to -- down -- all the way down to New York -- Upstate New York. Anyway -- to -- to the city. But I guess what I'm saying, what I think that we're going to see is movement. How can we be the most successful economy in the world without the first-rate infrastructure? We used to be number one in the world. Now we're number 13. It's just bizarre. But now we got -- not many, but we got something, a total of 45 Republicans in the House and Senate to vote for it and we got it passed. Look, not a single solitary Congress has ever reneged on a debt. The debt is not a debt that I accumulated. The debt is not a debt that occurred over the last several years. It's 200 years of debt. 200 years. And the idea that we wouldn't pay our debt is just bizarre. It's estimated that if we didn't pay the debt, we'd lose 750,000 jobs. We'd have a recession. It would be a disaster. And the idea someone for the first time is saying, unless you pass this ridiculous budget I have, which is the way I would characterize what the Republican MAGA budget is -- unless you pass this budget, we're not going to increase the debt limit and we're going to go bankrupt. We're -- we're going to -- the United States of America is going to renege for the first time in history on its debt. And this can't -- no one's ever tied them together before. I've said to the Republican Leader, here's the deal: take the debt limit, pass it like you did four, three times when Trump was president, and he increased the whole national debt for 200 years by 40 percent, and -- Play ball? Play ball? What? [Laughs] He ballooned the debt. He created unemployment -- look, when I came to office, we had incredibly high unemployment, we were in a situation where we were -- had very little movement on anything going on -- unemploy -- and look at the employment rate now. Just today, 250,000 new jobs, highest participation in 75 years of women in the job market, the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans. Things are moving. I know that. [Inaudible] I've not gotten there yet. And here's the deal, I think that -- first of all, this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different -- -- a different group. And I think that we have to make it clear to the American people that I am prepared to negotiate in detail with their budget. How much are you going to spend? How much are you going to tax? Where can we cut? For example, in the first years of my administration, I cut the debt by $1.7 trillion, 1.7 -- more than anybody's ever done in history. Their budget goes in and they -- there's no -- and there's no possibility they can pass their budget, zero. Zero possibility. They cut -- they cut 200 -- anyway, I won't -- I shouldn't get going on it, but -- I think he's an honest man. I think he's in the position, though, he had to make a deal and that was pretty -- you know, 15 votes. [Laughs] 15 votes that where he -- just about sold away everything that he -- at the far, far right. There's the Republican Party and there's the MAGA Republicans, and the MAGA Republicans really have put him in a position where in order to stay Speaker he has to agree -- he's agreed to things that, maybe he believes, but are just extreme. The answer is yes, I do, if I get a chance to get votes. They have to vote. They have to vote on something. Well, I'd like them to vote on whether or not they're going to provide for enough teachers in America so we can educate our kids. I'd want -- because their budget proposal cuts 100,000 teachers, eliminates 100,000 teachers, and their help. I -- I want the vote on making sure we have enough police and FBI agents in America. They're -- they -- they're cutting 28,000 federal agents, FBI, DEA and the rest of them. Why? They're making -- I want to make sure they guarantee that we're not going to be doing anything to eliminate Medicaid [emphasizes ""caid""] support for people. They cut their -- oh -- millions of Americans are being put in jeopardy. For example, one of the things that I think we've talked about is what I was able to do with regard to, I mean, Medicare, be able to negotiate drug prices. It cuts the federal deficit by $160 billion, $200 billion over the life of this plan. They want to eliminate it. They want to eliminate it. You know why it cuts it? Instead of having to pay the recipient for -- that needs insulin 400 bucks a month, they only have to pay now 6 -- excuse me, $35 a month because it only cost them 10 bucks to make it. Now that we can negotiate it. They want to eliminate that. So they want to cost the federal government more money and keep people in debt. Absolutely. Well, I don't think people -- by the way, every major one who won re-election, their polling numbers were where mine are now. So that -- so -- but -- No. No, I did -- I did -- all they've heard is negative news for years. Everything is negative. And I'm not being critical of the press. If you turn on the television, the only way you're going to get a hit is if there's something negative. You know, you don't -- anyway, that's number one. But number two, I think we're in a situation where you have much of what we were able to do only is going to come into -- come into play now. For example, I met today -- I set up what they call a -- a second cabinet. Within my cabinet, I have an enforcement group. They're the ones going out and making sure that we're getting the roads built and the highways built and getting the lead pipes out of every neighborhood for -- so people aren't dying or getting very sick. They're the ones who are making sure that people begin to know what's happened and what's happening. It's going to take time to get this done. And so, until we -- unless we can make it clear to the American people what it is that we've actually done -- it's one thing to say we're going to rebuild this bridge that's in the process of collapsing, other thing to actually get it built -- get it built. And that's all just starting. Well, President Obama and I became very good friends. I -- we just had a slightly different style of how we do things. As you recall, every major initiative President Obama had, I was the last guy in the room deciding that -- I'm giving him advice what we should do. And he's committed to helping in any way he can this time around. But look, I just think that Vice President Harris hasn't gotten the credit she deserves. She was Attorney General of the state of California. She has been a United State senator. She is really very, very good. And with everything going on, she hasn't gotten the attention she deserves. [Laughs] Because I have acquired a hell of a lot of wisdom and know more than the vast majority of people. And I'm more experienced than anybody that's ever run for the office, and I think I've proven myself to be honorable as well as also effective. [No Audio or video] Let her do it. Let her do it. [No Audio or video] Yeah. Bingo. Yes, there is. Number one, the first I ever introduced was to reform the -- the system that we have for immigration, number one. Number two, we're in a situation now where those 1,500 put at the border, they're not there to enforce the law, they're there to free up the border agents that need to be on the border. And we're having another thousand people coming in. There are asylum judges to make judgments, to move things along. I've asked this Congress for help in terms of what they need at the border. They need more agents. They need more people to clear people. They need more action to -- for example, we need these farm workers. They're badly needed. There has to be a legal pathway to citizenship. The idea DREAMers are still not being treated -- you know, I -- I love the way they talk about DREAMers. Can you imagine, you're a fi -- 6-year-old kid and mom says, we're crossing the Rio Grande, you say, no, mom, leave me here. I'm not -- I'm going to be -- I'll be all right. Come on. So there's so much that we can do and are going to do because, for example, I've worked out a very good relationship with AMLO, the president of Mexico. We're in a situation now where we're going to set up the ability for people to go into -- countries they want to leave, to go into an American facility to determine whether they qualify as a refugee, whether they qualify for asylum, whether they qualify for temporary work order. Speeding things up.  And so, there's a combination of making sure there's a system by which it's orderly and, number two, we -- where employers have access to additional people, particularly farm workers. [Responding to unidentified person] I'll -- I'll do one. The answer is yes, because that's why we can't let -- we cannot let this election be one where the same man who was president four years ago becomes president again. Look, the last -- [Crosstalk] Everything. Everything. Everything. [No Audio or video] It will not because he has done nothing wrong. And I'm proud of him. [Crosstalk] First of all, my son has done nothing wrong. I trust him. I have faith in him. It impacts my presidency by making me feel proud of him. Welcome to the Rose Garden. It's a dream come true to be president. But living here is a different tact. No, I didn't. But I did speak to the king. He's a good acquaintance, and we've worked together on environmental issues [Crosstalk] Well I told him I couldn't be here because I had this going on. And was you know, who knows what's going to happen in the next --  I told him I was with you. But and we're going to be going to a NATO conference in Europe, -- uh -- and I told him I'd stop there either on the way there or on the way back to discuss what he really is passionate about: the environment. I'm passionate about the people I grew up with getting an even shot. I really mean it.  [No audio or video] I mean, you know, the people I represented as a public defender."
Joe Biden,"Yeah, it is. It's a God's truth. And I miss it. Every once in a while, I take the Corvette out of the garage and just run up and down the driveway. You can't. Forty percent of all the CO2 going up is from the tailpipe. Imagine if we just changed that. Look at that. We just laid rubber. Yeah. I was getting married in August of '67. My dad didn't have a lot of money, but he ran the largest Chevrolet dealership in the state for years. So, there's 75 people outside the dealership. We pull up a spread. My dad says, ""This is my wedding gift."" Good to see you, man. Oh, man. I do. How the hell did you get that? Oh, my dad was the general manager. Well, I'll be damned. You're kidding me. It sure hell is. Well, I'll be darned. It looks like about a '78 Ford. '78. Sure does, man. I'd love to. All right. Thank you, pal. I think this is incredible. I -- I really do. It's the new hot rod. Feels different in three ways. One, it's quiet. Quiet as hell. Number two, if I accidentally hit it quicker, look at that. You know what I mean? It goes good. We just laid rubber. OK. You know, 25 miles an hour, and it's like, holy God, where did that come from? Instant. Instant. And -- and the third thing is everything seems to me to be a quicker response. Yeah, it is. It's a God's truth. And I miss it. Every once in a while, I take the Corvette out of the garage and just run up and down the driveway. You can't. A gigantic part. And it's also part of the -- what people don't realize it, it's part of the infrastructure bill, you know, building highways and the like. We were to put in 500,000 charging stations, and the money for those charging stations are in that bill, in addition to the charging stations individual companies are putting in. So, it's a game changer. You got 40 percent of all the pollution, all the CO2 going up is from the tailpipe. And imagine if we just change that. I do, too, because they're going to still be around. But the percentage of them in the way in which they're around is going to be very different. I agree. That's a good point. But you know what's happened, Jay? I think this last 15 months, I've gone to more devastating weather-induced crises -- Than ever. We're talking about millions of acres being burned to the ground. We're talking about the Colorado River -- Drying out. We're talking about things that, in fact, people all of a sudden now realize [Inaudible] You don't hear many people saying we don't have a climate crisis. I would argue the speed of that change was exponential in the last 18 months. One of the things I did was I'm a labor guy, and I think organized labor has gotten screwed. I got Lonnie Stephenson, the head of the IBEW, just sit with me for a long time and said, look, you guys are going to be so much better off. We're going to put in 500,000 electric charging stations all across America so you can drive across America. And so, now, they're all enthused. They're 100 percent behind it. And labor across the board is realizing this is the answer to their financial security and they're doing something good. I've driven a Hummer. The -- the Ford Lightning. By the way, that sucker is like -- I think it was like four-point-some seconds -- Zero to six in that sucker driving it. Yeah. That's right [Inaudible] It shocked me when I got into it. I said, ""OK. Hit the launch button."" And whoa. It was quick. The infrastructure bill, you know, building highways and the like. We're talking about putting 500,000 charging stations. And the money for those charging stations are in that bill. By the way, to get more efficient, the research that's going in is incredibly sophisticated. And the other thing is we're making such a significant investment in battery technology. We're not going to let China own the market. We're going to be in a position where we're moving toward wind power in this country in a gigantic way. What's happening is there now have battery capacity that you can have in your basement so when the wind stop blowing and the sun stops shining, it keeps you going for two days. One of the things nobody wants is transmission lines -- Somewhere near them. So, now, we're building solar facilities in the ocean off the shore using those same facilities. And you're not going in to build new -- High-tension wires in your neighborhood. Yup. I'll tell you where it's going to call it worse, it's causing trouble. All of Europe is totally dependent on Russia. For gas, particularly, and oil. And so, in order to keep Russia from being able to strangle the European's economy in the next two years, we've got to be in a position to provide them enough energy to continue to have their existing systems work. And by the way, we've got some significant new research and potential development on small nuclear power plants. That are much, much safer. Yeah. Great guy. I like to get that '06. Yeah. Well, believe me. Four-star general. A really decent, honorable man. And by the way, he became a quiet adviser of mine after I won. I go to him regular basis. The other thing was, I remember his Corvette is about double the horsepower of mine. OK? So, we were racing, remember? Well, I jumped -- I tacked out about six grand, jumped on it, laid rubber, and as soon as his fishtail was going down. And remember what he did? He pulled off way off to the right. Oh, God. What was going to happen? He wasn't sure I could keep it straight. Oh, God. Yeah. No, I know. No. Sure. All right. Hey, that looks like General Powell's Corvette right there. Hey, Michael. How are you? Good to see you, man. I've been well. We miss your dad, but I've been well. You got a grandchild? First. All right. Yeah, it is. Well, I tell you what, there's nothing like it. I can keep up with you, man. I've flat shift this sucker in second gear. I -- I got it. I got it. By the way, now, how many horsepower is this, 10,000 or something? Well, you know, I guess it gets down to the driving skills. Come on. Let's do it. We're going straight ahead, right? Straight ahead [Inaudible] The cameraman left of you, guy in the right. Ready to go. Yeah, it is. It's a God's truth. And I miss it. Every once in a while, I'd take the Corvette out of the garage and just run up and down the driveway. You can't. All right. Yup. I tell you what, man. It's amazing. And the thing about your father, which to me is the greatest compliment I can give a man or woman, he was absolutely, totally a man of his word. Whatever he said he believed, and whatever he said he'd do, he did. I'm thoroughly, completely honored and proud of your father's friendship and his support. I mean, you can imagine."
Joe Biden,"Well, two things. One, I can't guarantee when the check will come because Congress has to pass it. So, I'm waiting for the House of Representatives to vote on my package as well as the Senate to vote on. But I expect that they will be getting it within a couple of weeks after the bill is passed in the House and Senate, that I can sign. I expect they'll be getting a check for $1,400 shortly after that. Meaning within a couple of weeks after that. So, it could be another three weeks or so before someone would get a check.  Well, I do. Number one, I want to make sure they all are able to get vaccinated and so they're protected from COVID.  Without ICE or anyone else interfering, they should not be arrested for showing up, for being able to get a vaccination. We're also making sure that they're going to be able to have enough food. I propose in the legislation, not just these food banks, but increasing snap payments and other payments that are the things that allow people, 40 percent of the children in America are going hungry and a lot of them are in communities of color, Hispanic communities, and black communities, as well as Asian Pacific. So, we have to focus on making sure they have opportunities because they're making significant contributions. Well look at the number of people who are engaged in dealing with the pandemic, who happen to be children, who are dreamers. There are thousands of them. So, I've been focusing on what we do to keep families together and to treat people humanely while they're here, particularly the people who are helping everyone else stay around and alive.  I can assure them it's safe, number one, and I can assure them I'm doing everything to make it possible, to make it easier for them to get access to the vaccine. Making sure that mobile units go in communities. We're going from here to look at a site at a major stadium that's in a mixed area so they can get in an automobile and drive and walk and drive through and get the vaccination, get the vaccination if it's available to you. But I promise you, that's why, for example, I provided for community health centers to have direct access federally to vaccinations. That's why I provided for literally thousands more vaccinators. We had to increase the supply of vaccines. Plus, we had to get a lot of people who were not available up to now to come and put the vaccination in someone's arm. And we're focusing on communities that have been left behind, including rural communities, as well as inner-city and communities that relate that don't have.  Look, if you're a 65-year-old woman living alone and you want to get in line to get a vaccine at the local pharmacy, you may be three miles away and have no come, no way to get there. And so, we're doing everything possible.  And that's why we're with you.  No, there's a way to do that. That's why in this act, in this legislation I submitted provides for the means to open those schools, particularly schools from kindergarten through eighth grade. Number one, we can get those open quickly. All we need to do is provide the help for the schools for sanitation, for smaller class sizes, for example, everything from bus drivers to the sanitation workers in the schools. And so, we can do that and we can do it now.  Well, I can confirm this is over. Right now, there are thousands of immigrants, thousands of unaccompanied children coming across the border. We've been able to place a significant number of women in licensed facilities throughout this country, shelters across the country. But what happened in Texas, they opened up one, one that was formerly used in the last administration. Our hope and expectation is that it won't stay open very long, that we'll be able to provide for every kid who comes across the border safely to be housed in a facility that's licensed and what we're trying to do and we have literally hundreds of people doing now, connect them with families in this country, get them to the families that they came to see or they looking for. And we've already connected thousands of them that way. And so that's what our hope is to unite these children with families while they wait to have a hearing.  Well, it's much different in terms of more people there helping them. We have people that are in those facilities taking care of them. But my hope is they all are able to get out. All are able to get into licensed facilities and or be united with family members here in the United States.  I spoke yesterday with the king, not the prince. Made it clear to him that the rules are changing and we're going to be announcing significant changes today and on Monday. We are going to hold them accountable for human rights abuses and we're going to make sure that they, in fact, you know, if they want to deal with us, they have to deal with it in a way that the human rights abuses are dealt with. And we're trying to do that across the world. But particularly here, this report has been sitting there, the last administration wouldn't even release it. We immediately, when I got in, filed the report, read it, got it, and released it today. And it is outrageous what happened.  Two reasons. One originally, when I ran for the United States Senate at age 29 for the Senate, I supported the farmworkers, because we have a large, large agricultural population. That was a big issue. And Chavez was leading the effort. And I almost lost the election, because I was so vocal, number one. But number two, I admired him, a number three, his granddaughter works for me.  "
Joe Biden,"Well, first of all, let's put this in perspective. Inflation rate month to month was just -- just an inch, hardly at all, No, I'm not saying it is good news. But it was 8.2% or -- 8.2% before. I mean, it's not -- you're ac -- we act -- make it sound like all of a sudden, ""My god, it went to 8.2%."" It's been -- I got that. But guess what we are. We're in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn't spiked. It has just barely -- it's been basically even. And in the meantime, we created all these jobs and -- and prices -- have -- have gone up, but they've come down for energy. The fact is that we've created 10 million new jobs. We're in -- since we came to office. We're in a situation where the -- the unemployment rate is about 3.7%. one of the lowest in history. We're in a situation where manufacturing is coming back to the United States in a big way. And look down the road, we have mas -- massive investments being made in computer chips and -- and employment. So, I -- look, this is a process. This is a process. No. I don't think so. We hope we can have what they say, ""a soft landing,"" a transition to a place where we don't lose the gains that I ran to make in the first place for middle-class folks, being able to generate good-paying jobs and -- expansion. And at the same time -- make sure that we -- we are -- are able to continue to grow. No, I'm telling the American people that we're gonna get control of inflation. And their prescription drug prices are gonna be a hell of a lotta lower. Their health care costs are gonna be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody, their energy prices are gonna be lower. They're gonna be in a situation where they begin to gain control again. I'm -- more optimistic than I've been in a long time. Continue to grow the economy. And we're growing the economy. It's growing in -- in a way that it hasn't in years and years. We're growing entire new industries. Six hundred and ninety-five, I think it is, or eighty-five thousand new manufacturing jobs just since I've become president in United States. Continue to grow the economy and continue to give hard-working people a break in terms of we pay the highest drug prices in the world of any industrialized nation. Making sure that Medicare can negotiate down those prices by the way, we've also reduced the debt and reduced the deficit by $350 billion my first year. This year, it's gonna be over $1.5 trillion reduced the debt. So, to continue to put people in a position to be able to make a decent living and grow, and grow, and increase their capacity to grow. The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with COVID. We're still doing a lotta work on it. It's -- but the pandemic is over. if you notice, no one's wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it's changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it. Well, there's -- there's a couple things we've done. For example, remember I got some criticism for releasing a million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And then along came the industry saying they'd produce another million barrels a day by the spring. So, I think we're in relatively good shape. Sure he is. But, you know, we, the United States, are in much better shape than -- than anyone else is, and relative to Russia particularly. But -- he's been trying that for a while. He's not gonna succeed. [Camera cut to Biden in a car.] Anybody want to go to Washington, jump in. One of the things that happens in negotiations, particularly if they've been elongated like these have, is people say and do things where they -- the pride gets engaged as well. And it's awful hard to back off of some of these things. They both sat down, in my view -- and they were in the office today saying, ""Well, we finally figured it out. This is fair on both sides."" And it took that time to focus. And -- and the alternative was just not thinkable. If, in fact, they'd gone on a strike, the supply chains in this country would've come to a screeching halt. We would've seen a real economic crisis. Ukraine, through their -- the significant help we and our allies are giving them and the incredible bravery and the incredible determination of the Ukrainian people, are not losing a war, and they're making gains in certain areas. Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely and recognizing the sovereignty. They're defeating Russia. Russia's turning out not to be as competent and capable as many people thought they were gonna be. But winning the war? the damage it's doing, and the -- and the citizens, and the innocent people are being killed, it's awful hard to count that as winning. It has been barbaric, what he's done. His attacks on civilian -- everything from civilian hospitals to -- to, you know, people -- old-age homes, to neighborhoods where just ordinary people live -- -- to schools, it's -- it's just outrageous. And -- so the -- the price Ukrainian people are paying for this war is extremely high. But we're gonna stay with 'em as long as they need our help. As long as it takes. Yes. Don't. Don't. Don't. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II. I am not going to speculate -- You think I would tell you if I knew exactly what it would be? Of course, I'm not gonna tell you. It'll be consequential. They'll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur. We agree with what we signed onto a long time ago. And that there's one China policy, and Taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence. We are not moving -- we're not encouraging their being independent. We're not -- that -- that's their decision. Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack. Yes. No. I have not personally spoken to anyone on that -- in that regard. I'm sure my administration is aware of all of that, and so is the National Security Council. But I have not. No. Not ahead of time. How that could possibly happen. How one -- anyone could be that irresponsible. And I thought What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods? By that I mean names of people who helped or th -- et cetera. And it just -- totally irresponsible. I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take. I -- I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not. Look, if I were to say to you, I'm running again, all of a sudden, a whole range of things come into play that I have -- requirements I have to change and move and do. In terms of election laws. and it's much too early to make that kind of decision. I'm a great respecter of fate. And so, what I'm doing is I'm doing my job. I'm gonna do that job. And within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do. Look, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again. But it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen. Pretty good shape, huh? Watch me. And ma -- honest to God, that's all I think. Watch me. If you think I don't have the energy level or the mental acuity, then -- then, you know, that's one thing. It's another thing, you just watch and -- and, you know, keep my schedule. Do what I'm doing. I -- I think that -- you know -- I don't -- when I sit down with our NATO allies and keep 'em together, I don't have 'em saying, ""Wait a minute, w -- how -- how old are you? What are you -- what say?"" You know, I mean, it's a matter of, you know, that old expression: The proof of the pudding's in the eating. I mean, I -- I -- I respect the fact that people would say, you know, ""You're old."" And -- but I think it relates to h -- how much energy you have, and whether or not the job you're doing is one consistent with what any person of any age would be able to do. Oh, it's focused. I'd say it's -- I think it's -- I -- I haven't -- look, I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, my own head, the number of years. I no more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly. I mean, it's just not -- I haven't -- observed anything in terms of -- there's not things I don't do now that I did before, whether it's physical, or mental, or anything else. How'd an old guy do that? This is a really difficult time. We're at an inflection point in the history of this country. We're gonna make decisions, and we're making decisions now, that are gonna determine what we're gonna look like the next ten years from now. I think you'd agree that the impact on the psyche of the American people as a consequence of the pandemic is profound. Think of how that has changed everything. You know, people's attitudes about themselves, their families, about the state of the nation, about the state of their communities. And so there's a lot of uncertainty out there, a great deal of uncertainty. And we lost a million people. A million people to COVID. When I got in office, when I -- I got elected, only 2 million people had been vaccinated. I got 220 million -- m -- my point is it takes time. We were left in a very difficult situation. it's been a very difficult time. Very difficult. I love my son, number one. He fought -- an addiction problem. He overcame it. He wrote about it. And no, there's not a single thing that I've observed at all from th -- that would affect me or the United States relative to my son Hunter. For example, we passed the most extensive gun legislation in 30 years, although I'm not gonna rest till we get assault weapons -- banned, which I did once before when I was a senator. Assault -- assault weapons banned. There's no rationale. Deer aren't running through the woods wearing Kevlar vests. Again, I've gone to every one of those places. And in Uvalde, I spent time with every sing -- four hours. Four hours in the pain, pain, and it's just so, so unnecessary. So wrong. Who the hell m -- (SIGH) don't get me going. But I met with every one of those families and i -- and -- and the extended families for four hours. Look, our kids should be learning how to read and write, not duck and cover. Think about that. Think of the mental impact on these kids going back to school. We saw it. It's wrong. It's wrong. It's not who we are. And we've gotta stop it. We've got to stop it. And the NRA continuing to push the sale of -- assault and semiautomatic weapons is bizarre. Well, I don't think it's impossible. But it -- it -- it's changed. What we do today, think about it, it's all personal attacks. It's about motive. It's not about, ""I disagree with you on the -- on the subject matter. And secondly, I think that -- it's -- I think it's fair to say that we've not had a president like the last president, who has made all of it so personal. I've had six Republican senators, I promised I'd never say their names and I won't, come up to me in the last two years and say, ""Joe, I agree with you, but if I -- if I vote this way it's gonna -- they're gonna primary me. I'm gonna lose an election."" It didn't used to be that way. But it's coming back a little bit. It's coming back. Well, I'll tell you what, think about this. I was able to get -- we were able to get a bipartisan $1.2 trillion package done for dealing with the whole question of rebuilding the country, the roads and the highways. the fact of the matter is we've gotten a lot of things done bipartisanly. And everybody said, ""We're not gonna do anything, don't let Biden have any successes,"" et cetera. So it's still a way to go, but I think we're making some progress. Well, look -- I've had tragedies. I've lost part of my soul when I lost my son Beau, I lost my wife and my daughter in an accident. I think of all the people who've gone through what I've gone through and a lot more without what I had. I have had incredibly supportive family. There's so many literally heroes getting up every day putting one foot in front of the other with no help, I constantly think what would Beau want me to do? What would -- and, you know, this gets me a long way, this rosary. And he's looking up, and what's he say? He says, ""Why me, God?"" And the next scene, a voice from heaven, ""Why not?"" That's my dad. ""Why not, Joey? Why not you? Why not -- what makes you so different? Just get up."" My mom's expression was, ""Just get up. Get up. Get up."" A lot more to give. A lot more to give.  No I did not. That's a misreading of my speech, a fundamental misreading of my speech. [Begin video clip] MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards -- backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy. No right to contraception. No right to marry who you love. [End Video Clip] I was making a speech about the state of affairs in the Republican Party and us. I wasn't just talking about MAGA Republicans. The MAGA Republicans are the people who say refuse to acknowledge that an election took place and there was a winner. The MAGA Republicans are those people who in fact say that the use of violence as a legitimate tool, like what happened to the Capitol. They're the MAGA Republicans. You can't call yourself a Democratic republic and support violence internally against the government, and at the same time talk about not recognizing the outcome of the election that's overwhelmingly agreed to be legitimate. No, I don't fear that at all. I think a significant portion of mainstream Republicans know it to be true and agree."
Joe Biden,"Hey, Anderson. Good to see you. Hey, folks, how are you? [Applause] Good to be back, man. And you know you enjoyed being home with the baby more, I don't want to hear that -- [Laughs] I get it, no, no, everybody knows that I like kids better than people. That's right. That's right. Sure. By the end of July this year. We have, we came into office, there was only 50 million doses that were available. We have now, by the end of July we'll have over 600 million doses, enough to vaccinate every single American. They will be available. Be available. Here, look. What we did, we got into office and found out the supply, there was no backlog, I mean there was nothing in the refrigerator figuratively and literally speaking. And there are 10 million doses a day that were available. We've upped that in the first three weeks that we're in office to significantly more than that. We've moved out, went to the Pfizer and Moderna and said, can you produce more vaccine and more rapidly? They not only agreed to go from 200 to 400, then they agreed to go to 600 million doses. And we got them to move up the time because we used the National Defense Act to be able to help the manufacturing piece of it to get more equipment and so on. Well, no, a lot will be vaccinated in the meantime. In other words, not just all of a sudden 600 million doses are going to appear. And what's going to happen is it's going to continue to increase as we move along. And we'll have -- we'll have reached 400 million by the end of May and 600 million by the middle of -- by the end of July. And the biggest thing, though, as you remember when you and I, I shouldn't say it that way, as remember, but when you and I talked last, we talked about it's one thing to have the vaccine, which we didn't have when we came into office, but a vaccinator. How do you get the vaccine into someone's arm? So you need the paraphernalia. You need the needle. You need the mechanisms to be able to get it in. You have to have people who can inject it in people's arms. Yes, now we have made significant strides increasing the number of vaccinators. I issued an Executive Order allowing former retired docs and nurses to do it. We have over a thousand military personnel. The CDC has, I mean, excuse me, we have gotten the National Guard engaged. So we have significant number of vaccinators, people who will actually be there. Plus we've opened up a considerable number of locations where you can get the vaccination. How you doing? Yes. My mother would say, ""God bless you, son, no purgatory for you,"" four kids home, I really mean it. And by the way, the loss of being able to be in school is having significant impact on the children and parents as well. And what we found out is there are certain things that make it rational and easy to go back to the brick- and-mortar building. One, first of all, making sure everybody is wearing protective gear. It's available to students as well as to teachers, the janitors, the people who work in the cafeteria, the bus drivers. Secondly, organizing in smaller pods, which means that's why we need more teachers. Instead of a classroom of 30 kids in it, you have three classes in that same of 10 kids each in those, I'm making the number up, less, doesn't have to be literally 10. In addition to that, we also have indicated that it is much better, it's much easier to send kids K through eight back because they are less likely to communicate the disease to somebody else. But because kids and sophomores, juniors and seniors in high school, they socialize a lot more and they're older and they transmit more than young kids do, it's harder to get those schools open without having everything from the ventilation systems and having, for example, school bus drivers, you know. We've got to make sure that you don't have 60 kids or however many, it would depend on the size of the school bus, sitting two abreast in every single seat. And so there's a lot of things we can do short of and I think that we should be vaccinating teachers. We should move them up in the hierarchy as well. [Applause] No, that's not true. That's what was reported. That's not true. That was a mistake in the communication. But what I'm talking about is I said opening the majority of schools in K through eighth grade, because they're the easiest to open, the most needed to be open in terms of the impact on children and families having to stay at home -- I think we'll be close to that at the end of the first 100 days. We've had a significant percentage of them being able to be opened. My guess is they're going to probably be pushing to open all summer, to continue like it's a different semester and try to catch up. [Crosstalk] I think many of them five days a week. The goal will be five days a week. Now it's going to be harder to open up the high schools for the reasons I have said. And just like you notice the contagion factor in colleges is much higher than it is in high schools or grade schools. What do you teach? My wife teaches, God love you. Number one, nobody is suggesting, including the CDC in its recent report, that you have large classes, congested classes. It's smaller classes, more ventilation, making sure that everybody has a mask and is socially-distanced, meaning you have less, fewer students in one room. Making sure that everyone from the sanitation workers who work in the lavatories, in the bathrooms and to do all the maintenance, that they are in fact able to be protected as well. Making sure you are in a situation where you don't have the congregation of a lot of people, as I said, including the school bus, including getting on a school bus. So it's about needing to be able to socially distance, smaller classes, more protection. And I think that teachers and the folks who work in the school, the cafeteria worker and other should be on the list of preferred to get a vaccination. Kerri, how are you? Well, the answer is yes, there are. But here is how it works. The states make the decisions on who is in what order. I can make recommendations and for federal programs, I can do that as President of the United States. But I can't tell the state, you must move such- and-such, a group of people up. But here is what I'd like to do. If you're willing, I'll stay around after this is over and maybe we can talk a few minutes and see if I can get you some help. [Applause] Yes, it would. Well, it depends on how much they have available. I think there still should be priority groups in case there are not enough for everyone, available to everybody. And look, we don't know for certain, let me tell you what my national COVID team has said, that the variants, by variants you mean the Brazilian strain, the South African strain, the British strain -- [Crosstalk] -- London, et cetera. Thus far, thus far, there is no evidence that the existing vaccinations available from Moderna and Pfizer do not either make sure that they apply, they work as well against the strain in the United States. And there is no evidence that they're not helpful. So if you can get a vaccination, get it whenever you can get it, regardless of the other strains that are out there. There are studies going on to determine it's not only more communicable, but are there vaccines -- do the vaccines not provide helpful protection by getting the vaccine? There are some speculation -- I've got to be very careful here because millions of people are watching this, it may be that a certain vaccination for a certain strain may reduce from 95 percent to a lower percentage of certainty that it will keep you from getting -- -- it may not be as effective. Still be effective. So the clear notion is if you're eligible, if it's available, get the vaccine. Get the vaccine. By the way, you've heard me say this before, Becky, if there's any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live, nurses make you want to live. I can tell you as a consumer of health care, my family, you're wonderful. Thank you for what you do. Well, first of all, it is a priority, number one. Number two, there's two reasons for it being the way it is. Number one, there is some history of blacks being used as guinea pigs in other experiments as I need not tell you, Doctor, over the last 50 to 75 to 100 years in America. So there is a concern about getting the vaccine whether it's available or not. But the biggest part of this is access -- -- physical access. That's why last week I opened up, I met with the Black Caucus in the United States Congress and agreed that I would -- all of the -- all of community health centers now, which take care of the toughest of the toughest neighborhoods in terms of illness, they are going to get a million doses, you know, a week, and how we're going to move forward because they're in the neighborhood. Secondly, we have opened up -- and I'm making sure that there's doses of vaccine for over 6,700 pharmacies because almost everyone lives within -- not always walking distance, but within the distance of being able to go to the pharmacy like when you got your flu shot. That is also now being opened. Thirdly, I also am providing for mobile -- mobile vans, mobile units to go into neighborhoods that are hard to get to because people are -- for example, even though everyone is within, you know, basically five miles of a Walgreen's, let's say, the fact is if you're 70 years old, you don't have a vehicle and you live in a tough neighborhood, meaning, you're -- it's a high concentration of COVID, you're not likely to be able to walk five miles to go get a vaccine. The other thing we found is -- I'm sorry to go on, but this is really important to me -- the other part -- portion is a lot of people don't know how to register. Not everybody in the community, in the Hispanic and the African-American community, particularly in rural areas that are distant and/or inner city districts know how to use -- know how to get online to determine how to get in line for that COVID vaccination at the Walgreen's or at the particular store. So, we're also -- I've committed to spend a billion dollars on public education to help people figure out how they can get in there. That's -- we're also trying to set up mass vaccination centers like places in stadiums and the like. Sure. Yes. And I have because look at what we inherited. We inherited a circumstance here where, now for the first -- we did a lot in the first two weeks, a circumstance where, number one, there weren't many vaccinators. You didn't know where you could go get a vaccine administered to you because there was no one to put it in your arm, number one. Number two, there was very little federal guidance as of what to look for, how to find out where, in fact, you could go. You can go online and every single state now has a slightly different mechanism by which they say who's qualified, where you can get the vaccines and so on. So it's all about trying to more rationalize in detail so ordinary people like me can understand, I mean that sincerely. I mean, my grandchildren can use that online, you know, make me look like I'm, you know, the seventh century, but all kidding aside. This is a process. And it's going to take time. It took us -- think of what we didn't do, and you and I talked about this during the campaign, we didn't do from the time it hit -- it hit the United States. You're going to inject something in your arm. It's going to go away. You're going to be -- it'll all be done by Easter. We wasted so much time, so much time. Oh, you're getting old. Second grade. Well, has your school -- have you been in school, honey? No? See, that's -- that's kind of a scary thing, too. You don't get to go to school. You don't get to see your friends. And so what a lot of kids and, I mean, and big people, too, older people, they just -- their whole lives have sort of changed like when it used to be. It used to be you just go outside and play with your friends and get in the school bus and go to school, and everything was normal. And now, when things change, people get really worried and scared. But don't be scared, honey. Don't be scared. You're going to be fine. And we're going to make sure mommy is fine, too. Sure. Well, you know, all the experts, all the committee that I put together of the leading researchers in the world in the United States are on this committee of mine, headed by Dr. Fauci and others, they tell me, be careful not to predict things that you don't know for certain what's going to happen because then you'll be held accountable. I get that. But let me tell you what I think based on all that I've learned and all that I've studied and all that I think that I know. It's fairly -- it's a high probability that the vaccinations that are available today and the new one, Johnson & Johnson, God-willing, will prove to be useful, that with those vaccinations, the ability to continue to spread the disease is going to diminish considerably because of -- they call herd immunity. And now they're saying, somewhere around 70 percent of the people have to constitute, some people said 50, 60, but a significant number have to be in a position where they are -- they have been vaccinated and/or they've been through it or -- -- and have antibodies. So if that works that way, as my mother would say with the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors, that by next Christmas, I think we'll be in a very different circumstance, God-willing, than we are today. I think a year from now, when it's 22 below zero here -- no, a year from now, I think that there will be significantly fewer people having to be socially distanced, have to wear a mask, instead of -- but we don't know. So I don't want to overpromise anything here. I told you when I ran and when I got elected, I will always level with you. To use Franklin Roosevelt's example, I will shoot you, give it straight from the shoulder, straight from the shoulder what I know and what I don't know. We don't know for certain. But it is highly unlikely that by the beginning of next year, school -- traditional school year in September, we are not significantly better off than we are today. But it matters. It matters whether you continue to wear that mask. It matters whether you continue to socially distance. It matters whether you wash your hands with hot water. Those things matter. They matter. And that can save a lot of lives while we're getting to this point, we get to herd immunity. I'm committed to pass -- look, here's -- some of you are probably economists or college professors or you're teachers in school. This is the first time in my career -- and as you can tell, I'm over 30 -- the first time in my career that there is a consensus among economists left, right, and center that is over -- and including the IMF and in Europe, that overwhelming consensus is, in order to grow the economy a year, two, three, and four down the line, we can't spend too much. Now is the time we should be spending. Now is the time to go big. You may recall I managed the last experiment we had with stimulus, and it was 800 -- [Applause] No, I don't mean it that way, but it was $800 billion. We thought we needed more than that, and we think we did. We got -- it ended up working, but it slowed things up by about -- and depending who you talk to, between six months and a year and a half. We can come back, we can come roaring back. It's estimated that if we -- by most economists, including Wall Street firms, as well as, you know, think tanks, political think tanks, left, right, and center, it is estimated that if we pass this bill alone, we'll create seven million jobs this year -- seven million jobs this year. And so -- [Applause] -- the thing we haven't talked about, I'm not going to go on because I want to hear your question, I apologize -- we haven't talked about -- I remember you and I talking during the campaign, and you had the former guy saying that, well, you know, we're just going to open things up, and that's all we need to do. We said, no, you've got to deal with the disease before you deal with getting the economy going. Well, the fact is that the economy now has to be dealt with, and what is -- look at all the people. You have over 10 million people unemployed. We need unemployment insurance. We need to make sure that, you know, you have 40 percent of the children in America -- talk about food shortage, 60 percent of -- did you ever think you'd see a day in Milwaukee, you'd see in the last six months people lining up in their automobiles for an hour or for as far as you could see to get a bag of food? What -- I mean, this is the United States of America for God's sake. We can't deal with that? We promise -- look at all the people who are on the verge of being kicked out of their apartments because they cannot afford -- they cannot afford the rent. What happens when that happens? Everything -- look at all the mom and pop landlords that are in real trouble if we don't subsidize this in the meantime. Look at all the people who are on the verge of missing and how many people have missed their last two mortgage payments and are able to be foreclosed on. That's why I took executive action to say they cannot be foreclosed on in the meantime, because -- look at what the impact on the economy would be. You think it's bad now, let all that happen. Look at all the people who have lost their insurance. How many -- I'm not asking for a show of hands -- how many have had jobs with corporations or companies that provided health care, the COBRA health care? Well, guess what? The company goes under, and guess what? You lose your health insurance. Well, we should be making sure you're able to pay for that, so that we keep people moving. So there's a lot -- so I think bigger and the vast majority of the serious people say bigger is better now, not spending less. Randy. Well, first of all, the South is not much different than the Midwest in that regard as well. But here is the thing. If you look back over the last 40 years as minimum wage has increased, people haven't -- the end -- the end result of net employment hasn't changed. The vast majority of the economists and there are studies that show that by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it could have an impact on a number of businesses but it would be de minimis, et cetera. Here is the deal. It's about doing it gradually. We're at $7.25 an hour. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty. [Applause] But it's totally legitimate for small business owners to be concerned about how that changes. For example, if it went -- if we gradually increased it -- when we indexed it at $7.20, if we kept it indexed by -- to inflation, people would be making 20 bucks an hour right now. That's what it would be. Yes, but there's also -- if you read that whole thing about Pinocchios and all the rest, there are also equal number of studies say that's not -- that it wouldn't have that effect, and particularly, as you do it in terms of how gradually you do it. So let's say -- you said you're going to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour between now and the year 2025 to $12 an hour, to $13 an hour. You double someone's pay, and the impact on business would be absolutely diminished, and it would grow the GDP, and it would grow -- and it would generate economic growth. But it's not illegitimate as a small-business person to worry about whether or not increasing it at one fell swoop would have that impact. I do support a $15 minimum wage. I think there is equally as much if not more evidence to dictate that it would grow the economy and long- run and medium-run benefit small businesses as well as large businesses, and it would not have such a dilatory effect. But that's a debatable issue. Change it drastically -- first of all, by making sure we have inspectors general. You may remember, when the first bill passed, you may remember there was a guy running saying what's going to happen is the banks aren't going to lend you the money. They're going to ask you a question, ""Do you have your credit with us? How many loans do you have with us? What is your -- what credit cards do you have with us? How"" -- because, even though they were being underwritten, and we bailed their rear ends out last time out, they weren't -- it was too much trouble to lend to you. What -- what did the president do? And I don't want to pick on the -- I shouldn't -- I'm tired of talking about Donald Trump, don't want to talk about him anymore, but in -- the last administration spent time, a lot of time, talking about how there was no need for inspector generals. We find out that 40 percent of the money, the PPE loans to go to -- PPP loans to got to small businesses -- went to -- went to corporations that were multi-million dollar corporations. You're going to see an investigation showing that a lot of this was fraudulent, where it went. So what I'm doing is I provide $60 billion for you to be able to make capital investments in order to be able to open safely and make sure you're in a position that you can do the things that are recommended. You've noticed there's been very little federal direction for you all as to how to safely open your businesses. Yet you know, if you're able to test your employees; if you're able to be in a situation, if you serve people, you have plexiglass dividers, if you -- there's a whole range -- if you're able to have everybody with -- with masks and the like, you can do so much to safely open. But you don't get that direction. So the money, I guarantee you, is going to go to small businesses with people -- and I'm shooting -- and by the way, the original definition of a small business is 500 or fewer employees. Well, that's not what I mean by small businesses. What we meant by small businesses, the mom-and-pop businesses that hold communities together and keep people together, and particularly in neighborhoods where, if you don't have a beauty shop, a barbershop, a hardware store, a grocery store, et cetera, the center of the community begins to disintegrate some. So what I'd like to do is, if you are willing to give me an address, lay out for you precisely, without taking more time -- I'm going to get in trouble; I was supposed to only talk two minutes in an answer -- is to let you know exactly how that $60 billion and part of the recovery package will go to small businesses. [Applause] I'm not going to call names out. I -- look, I -- for four years, all that's been in the news is Trump. The next four years, I want to make sure all the news is the American people. I'm tired of talking about Trump. [Applause] I made it clear that one of the things about -- that one of the most serious pieces of damage done by the last administration was the -- the politicizing of the Justice Department. Any of you who are lawyers know, whether you're a Democrat, Republican, conservative or liberal, it has been more politicized than any Justice Department in American history. I made a commitment, I will not ever tell my Justice Department -- and it's not mine; it's the people's Justice Department -- who they should and should not prosecute. Their prosecutorial decisions will be left to the Justice Department, not me. [Applause] I'm not bad at the literature part, but after five years of French, I still can't speak a word, so I apologize. [Laughter] I -- by the way, I understand a little bit of Yiddish. It is complex and it's wide ranging, and it's real. You may -- I got involved in politics to begin with because of civil rights and opposition to white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, and the most dangerous people in America continue to exist. That is the greatest threat to terror in America, domestic terror. And so I would make sure that my Justice Department and the civil rights division is focused heavily on those very folks, and I would make sure that we, in fact, focus on how to deal with the rise of white supremacy. And you see what's happening, the studies that are beginning to be done, maybe at your university as well, about the impact of former military, former police officers, on -- on the growth of white supremacy in some of these groups. You may remember, in one of my debates with the former president, I asked him to condemn the Proud Boys and he wouldn't do it. He said ""Stand by,"" stand ready, or whatever the phrase exactly was. It is a bane on our existence. It has always been. As Lincoln said, we have to appeal to our better angels, and these guys are not -- and women -- are, in fact, demented. They are dangerous people. James, if I say anything you don't like, let me know right away, will you? You're about as big as a mountain. Three things. First of all, I was a public defender as well. And I think it's high time that we had public defenders being paid the same as prosecutors. My son, by the way, was a great prosecutor. He was the attorney general of the State of Delaware, and he was a federal prosecutor before that. And so I'm not condemning all prosecutors. But I am saying that it matters that you have adequate defense and you are able to attract people who in fact can live on being able to be that public defender, number one. Number two, we are pushing very hard -- and I think we'll get it done -- is the legislation relating to what is appropriate police behavior and studying police behavior and coming down with recommendations that are consistent with the legislation that was put in place as a consequence of all the world seeing one man shoved up against a curb and murdered after eight minutes and 46 seconds. And so there's a number of things relating to everything from no-knock warrants and -- and a whole range of things you know. There's legislation that's being introduced separately. I hope it will pass. But, thirdly, I think we have to deal with systemic racism that exists throughout society. And one of the things I'm going to recommend there is that we look at an entire panoply of things that affect whether or not people of color, primarily, are -- are treated differently. And that goes for everything from prosecutorial discretion. You know as a public defender -- and by that I mean what happens is -- it will take too long to go through the whole explanation, but let me do it -- try to do it quickly. What happens now is, if you in fact are going to -- you arrest someone because they had -- and you want to charge them, you can charge them with robbery or armed robbery. You charge them with armed robbery, you get a lot more time than if you don't charge with robbery. But if you want to make sure that someone who doesn't know much about their representation is able to -- you engage in prosecutorial misconduct by offering them to plead to essentially -- it's not the same -- burglary, which gets them two years and probation, and so you don't even get a trial. You plead, because you don't have adequate representation. You feel like everything's against you, and you're in trouble. When I did the sentencing act, that was designed to keep -- make sure we had the same time for the same crime. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I had looked at all 10 federal districts, and we took six months to do it, and found out, if you were black, if you were a first-time offense of being accused of burglary, and maybe you committed it, and you were white and you did the same exact crime, in all 10 districts throughout the United States of America, the person -- and don't hold me to the exact numbers, but the percentages are right. If you're a first-time white guy, you would get two years. You would get seven years if you're black. So, in order to make sure that you could not send people to jail for the same crime, I came up with this -- this sentencing commission, which said that everybody who commits the crime has to receive between, instead of 0 to 20 years, you drastically cut down the number of years you could go to jail, but say you have to -- if it's a one -- first-time offense, you have to get sentenced between 1.5 and three years, OK? Well, what happens is, prosecutors used that as a mechanism to send people to jail. It makes it look like they're -- we're dealing with mandatory sentencing, which it wasn't designed to do at all. It was designed to make sure that people were treated fairly. There's much more. I'm sorry to go on. There's much more to talk about, but -- Exactly. By, number one, not defunding the police. We have to put more money in police work, so we have legitimate community policing, and we're in a situation where we change the legislation. No one should go to jail for a drug offense. No one should go to jail for the use of a drug. They should go to drug rehabilitation, drug rehabilitation, number one. [Applause] We should be in a position where we change the system of -- sentencing system to one that relates to a notion of -- I'm basically telling you to -- is related to making sure that what you do is, you focus on making sure that there's rehabilitation. The idea that we don't have people in prison systems learning how to be spending the money, learning how to be mechanics, learning how to be cooks, learning how to have a profession when you get out, the idea that we deny someone who served their time access to Pell Grants, access to housing, access to -- right now, as you well know, most places, you get out of prison, you get 25 bucks and a bus ticket. You end up back under the bridge, exactly where you were before. And the fact is that the concern in many minority communities is black-on-black, Hispanic-on-Hispanic, not just -- but here's the deal. There has to be much more serious -- how can I say it? Much more serious determination as to what the background and the attitudes of the recruit is, where -- what their views are. There should be much more psychological testing, like you would if you're going into the intelligence community. What is it? What are the things that make you respond the way you do? Because there is, there is inherent prejudice built into the system as well. And we also need to provide for -- and it's happening -- more African-American and more Hispanic police officers. Now, by the way, they don't get it all right either by a long shot. But every cop, when they get up in the morning and put on that shield, has a right to expect to be able to go home to their family that night. Conversely, every kid walking across the street wearing a hoodie is not a member of a gang and is about to knock somebody off. [Applause] So, it's about education. I would love to talk to you more about it, because it is the answer, in my view, that and education, actually access to education. And one of the things that I talk a lot about -- and I'm sorry to go on about this, but it's important -- I don't think we can look at opportunity in the African -- let's stick with the African-American community for a minute -- in terms of the criminal justice system. That is only one small piece of why people are the way they are. You realize -- I don't know what home you live in, but if you go ahead and you want to get insurance, and you're in a black neighborhood, you're going to pay more for the same insurance I'm going to pay for the exact same home. Your car, you have never had an accident in your car. You live in a black neighborhood, you're going to pay a higher premium on your car. You're going to -- so, there are so many things that are built in institutionally that disadvantage African-Americans and Latinos, that, in fact, I think -- and one of the great advantages -- I'm sorry to go on. But one of the great advantages, as bad as things are -- I keep reading from presidential historians how I have inherited the worst situation since Lincoln, worse than Roosevelt, because -- economic crisis, political crisis, racial crisis, et cetera. But the fact is that everyone's gotten a close-up look now and seen what's happened. That kid, that kid holding that camera for eight minutes and 46 seconds awakened the whole world. When I met with his little daughter after he was dead, she said: ""My daddy's changed the world."" Guess what? Not only here in the United States, around the world, people said, whoa, I didn't know that happened. Dr. King, when my generation, when I got involved in the civil rights movement as a high school student in the early '60s, and you had Bull Connor and his dogs in the late '50s, siccing it on those ladies going to -- in their black dresses going to church and little kids, and fire hoses ripping their skin off. He said, what happened there was, it was a second emancipation, because people in places where there weren't black communities said: That really happens? I didn't believe it. They saw it happen. And so it generated the Voting Rights Act. It generated the Civil Rights Act. And he called it the second emancipation. We have a chance now, a chance now, to make significant change in racial disparities. And I'm going to say something that's going to get me in trouble, which I couldn't go through a whole show without doing that. And that is that, think about it. If you want to know where the American public is, look at the money being spent in advertising. Did you ever five years ago think every second or third ad out of five or six you would turn on would be biracial couples? [Applause] No, I'm not -- I'm not being facetious. The reason I'm so hopeful is, this new generation, they're not like us. They're thinking differently. They're more open. And we have got to take advantage of it. [Applause] I'm sorry. Good evening. I take issue with what everybody says about the division. For example, my -- my plan on COVID, 69 percent of the American people support it, 69 percent, in this state, recent poll, 60 percent, 60 percent, 45 percent of Trump voters and 55 percent of Republican voters. The nation is not divided. You go out there and take a look and talk to people, you have fringes on both ends, but it's not nearly as divided as we make it out to be. And we have to bring it together. You may remember how -- the trouble I got in. I said there were three reasons I was running, one, to restore the soul of the country, decency, honor, integrity, talk about the things that mattered to people, treat people with dignity. Secondly, I said to rebuild the backbone of the country, the middle class, and this time bring everybody along and have a chance. And the third reason is unite the country. Well, in my own primary, I got laughed -- unite the country? What are you talking about? You cannot function in our system without consensus, other than abusing power at the executive level. So, I really think there's so many things that we agree on that we don't focus enough on. And that's, in large part, I think, because we don't just condemn the things that are so obviously wrong, obviously wrong, that everybody agrees on, the way they were raised, the way we were raised. As my mother would say, if half the things that occurred in the last campaign came out of my mouth, when she would say as a kid, you would wash my mouth out with soap. I mean, we have to be more decent and treat people with respect and just -- just decency. Yes. Yes, there's a whole range of things that relate to immigration, including the whole idea how you deal with -- what confuses people is, you talk about refugees, you talk about undocumented, you talk about people who are seeking asylum, and you talk about people who are coming from the -- that are coming from camps around -- being held around the world. And there are four different criteria for being able to come to the United States. The vast majority of the people, the 11 million undocumented, they're not Hispanics. They're people who came on a visa, was able to buy a ticket to get on a plane, and didn't go home. They didn't come across the Rio Grande and swim -- excuse me. [Laughter] And -- and -- sorry. That's the Irish in me. But, all kidding aside, so -- so, there are a lot of things that relate. But I think that we can no longer -- look, you have heard -- I'm -- even if you're not involved in politics at all, you have probably heard me say this 1,000 times, and matter -- that everyone is entitled to be treated with decency, with dignity. Everyone is entitled to that. And we don't do that now, for the first time in American history. If you're seeking asylum, meaning you're being persecuted, you're seeking asylum, you can't do it from the United States. You used to come, have an asylum officer determine whether or not you met the criteria, and send you back if you, in fact -- but you can't even do that. You have got to seek asylum from abroad. Yes. Yes. Well, yes. [Applause] But, by the way, if you came along and said to me, in the meantime, we can work out a system whereby we're going to -- for example, we used to allow refugees, 125,000 refugees, into the United States on a yearly basis. It was as high as 250,000. Trump cut it to 5,000. Come with me into Sierra Leone. Come to me into parts of Lebanon. Come with me around the world and see people piled up in camps, kids dying, no way out, refugees fleeing from persecution. We, the United States, used to do our part. We were part of that. We're -- and that's -- send me your huddled masses. Come on. And so, I would, if you had a refugee bill by itself -- I'm not suggesting that, but I would -- there's things that I would deal by itself, but not at the expense of saying, I'm never going to do the other. There is a reasonable path to citizenship. And it shows up. One of the reasons why we have been able to compete with the rest of the world so well is, most of our major competitors are xenophobic. You remember -- I remember you questioning me when I came back from China. And I said, I predict, within less than a year, they're going to end their One-China policy. And I got clobbered by saying -- because they said: Biden didn't talk about the fact that how immoral it was. And it was when we were running against the Republican ticket led by Mitt Romney, a fine guy. Yes, for two hours. The Uyghurs. We must speak up for human rights. It's who we are. We can't -- my comment to him was -- and I know him well, and he knows me well. We're -- a two-hour conversation. I talked about this too. And that's not so much refugee, but I talked about it. I said, look -- Chinese leaders, if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been the time China when has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven't been unified at home. So, the central -- to vastly overstate it, the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that. I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China, and Taiwan, trying to end the One-China policy by making it forceful, I said -- by the way, he said he gets it. Culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow. But my point was that, when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president and he was the vice president -- and that's how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu -- not a joke -- his predecessor, President Hu, and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another, because he was going to the president. And I came back and said, they're going to end their one-child policy, because they're so xenophobic, they won't let anybody else in. And more people are retired than working. How can they sustain economic growth when more people are retired? Well, there will be repercussions for China. And he knows that. What I'm doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude. China is trying very hard to become the world leader and to get that moniker. And to be able to do that, they have to gain the confidence of other countries. And as long as they're engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it's going to be hard for them to do that. But it's more much more complicated than that. I'm -- I shouldn't try to talk China policy in 10 minutes on television here. Good evening. Me too. [Laughter] You think I'm kidding. I will not make that happen. It depends on whether or not you go to a private university or a public university. It depends on the idea that I say to a community, I'm going to forgive the debt, the billions of dollars of debt for people who have gone to Harvard and Yale and Penn and schools my children -- I went to a great school. I went to a state school. But is that is going to be forgiven, rather than use that money to provide money for early education for young children who are -- come from disadvantaged circumstances? But here's what I think. I think everyone -- and I have been proposing this for four years. Everyone should be able to go to community college for free, for free. That's -- [Applause] That costs $9 billion. And we should pay for it. And the tax policies we have now, we should be able to pay for you. You spend almost that much money as a break for people who own racehorses. And I think any family making under $125,000 whose kids go to a state university they get into, that should be free as well. And the thing I do in terms of student debt that's accumulated is provide for changing the existing system now for debt forgiveness if you engage in volunteer activity. For example, if you were -- if you're teaching school, after five years, you would have $50,000 of your debt forgiven. If you worked in a battered women's shelter, if you worked -- and so on. So, you would be able to forgive debt. Thirdly, I'm going to change the position that we have now to allow for debt forgiveness, because it's so hard to calculate, whereby you can now -- depending on how much you make and what program you start, you can work off that debt by the activity you have, and you cannot be charged more than X-percent of your take-home pay, so that it doesn't affect your ability to buy a car, own a home, et cetera. Each of my children graduated from school. I mortgaged the house. I was listed as the poorest man in Congress for -- not a joke -- for over 30 years. And -- but I was able to borrow. I bought a home I spent a lot of time working on. And I was able to sell it for some profit. But my oldest son graduated after undergraduate and graduate school with $136,000 in debt, after working 40 -- I mean -- excuse me -- 30 hours a week during school. My other son went to Georgetown and Yale Law School, graduated with $142,000 in debt. And he worked for a parking service in -- down in Washington. My daughter went to Tulane University and then got a master's at Penn. She graduated with $103,000 in debt. So, I don't think anybody should have to pay for that, but I do think you should be able to work it off. My daughter's a social worker. My other son became a -- ran the World Food Program USA, and so on. They didn't qualify. But my point is, I understand the impact of the debt. And it can be debilitating. And I think there's a whole question about what universities are doing. They don't need more skyboxes. What they need is more money invested in making -- so, that's why I provide, for example, $80 billion -- $70 billion over 10 years for HBCUs and other minority-serving universities, because they don't have the laboratories to be able to bring in those government contracts that can train people in cybersecurity or other future endeavors that pay well. But I do think that, in this moment of economic pain and strain, that we should be eliminating interest on the debts that are accumulated, number one. And, number two, I'm prepared to write off the $10,000 debt, but not $50,000. Because I don't think I have the authority to do it by signing with a pen. I get up in the morning and look at Jill and say: Where the hell are we? [Laughter] No, it's -- look, it's -- you know, I have only been president for four weeks. And, sometimes, because things are moving so fast, not because of a burden, it feels like four years. It's not because of the burden. It's because there's so much happening that you focus on, you're constantly focusing on one problem or opportunity, one right after -- ad seriatim. But what happens is that it's -- what I didn't realize, I had been in the Oval Office a hundred times as vice president or more -- more than that, every morning for the initial meetings. But I had never been up in the residence. And one of the things -- I don't know about you all, but I was raised in a way that you didn't look for anybody to wait on you. And it's -- we're -- I find myself extremely self-conscious. There are wonderful people that work at the White House. But someone is standing there and making sure I -- hands me my suit coat, or -- I had only been upstairs in the Yellow Room, the Oval upstairs. No, and -- but it's -- but, look, the people down there are wonderful. And I find that, like my dad -- you have heard me say this before. My dad used to say, everybody, everybody is entitled to be treated with respect. And it's interesting how decent and incredible these folks are. You know, I don't know what I ever expected it to be. I -- it is different, in that -- get in trouble here. I said when I was running I wanted to be president not to live in the White House, but to be able to make the decisions about the future of the country. And so living in the White House, as you have heard other presidents who have been extremely flattered to live there, has -- it's a little like a gilded cage, in terms of being able to -- but walk outside and do things. The vice president's residence is totally different. You're on 80 acres overlooking the rest of the city. And you can walk out. There's a swimming pool. You can walk off the porch in the summer and jump in a pool and go into work. You can ride a bicycle around and never leave the property and work out. You can -- and -- but the White House is very different. And I feel a sense of -- I must tell you, a sense of history about it. Jon Meacham, who you know, and several other presidential historians helped me with my -- I asked my brother, who's good at this, to set up the Oval Office for me, because it all happens within two hours, you know, literally. They move everything out and move something -- and it was interesting to hear these historians talk about what other presidents have gone through and the moments, and who are the people who stepped up to the ball and who are the people who didn't? And what you realize is, the most consequential thing, for me, is, although I have known this watching seven presidents who I got to know fairly well, is, I always in the past looked at the presidency in the terms of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt and George Washington, and how can -- like they're superhuman. But I had to remind myself that the really fine men that I knew well, the last seven presidents, and at least there are people who I knew well enough to know that I could play on the same team with. So, it took away the sense of, this is -- my God, I'm not Abraham Lincoln. I'm not Franklin Roosevelt. How do I deal with these problems? Yes, I have. No, I don't. They're private conversations. [Laughter] But -- and, by the way, all of them have, with one exception, picked up the phone and called me as well. [Laughter] No, but, look, it's the greatest honor, I think, an American can be given, from my perspective. And I literally pray that I have the capacity to do for the country what you all deserve need be done. But one thing I learned after eight years with Barack is, no matter how consequential the decision, I got to be the last person in the room with him literally on every decision. I can make a recommendation, but I walked out of the room, and it was all him, man, nobody else. The buck stops there. And that's where you pray for making sure that you're looking at the impact on the country and a little bit of good luck at the judgment you're making. Thank you."
Joe Biden,"OK. Look, one of the things that's happened in the last 25 years, we've lost a manufacturing base in places that used to be proud producers of good jobs, whether it's in northeast Pennsylvania or here or all across the country. They've lost hope. And this brings back hope. You see -- you saw the reaction of the people out there. It wasn't so much the brilliance of the speeches, it was there's hope. We're back. And it's going to mean that we are going to be the leading chip manufacturer in the world. We invented these chips. We did the memory chips. We're the ones that did all the -- we, the United States. It's about time it came home. Top-line reaction is really good. There's nothing bad about the report. Nothing bad about the report. And the core inflation is actually down about 1.5. We're in a situation where we've created more jobs. We're in a situation where -- and look, the price of gasoline is falling. The price of gasoline in just in the last several months is down $1.26 or $1.27. And if the -- if the oil companies start to charge what they should be charging based on the cost of a barrel of oil, it'd be down to another $0.40. And I'm going to keep pushing as I get it down. My messages were getting them down. I told you I'd bring them down. We're bringing it down. I come from a family where ever gas prices went up or food prices went up, what happened? What happened was it was a conversation on the kitchen table. And we're doing a whole lot of other things. And by the way, the food prices -- the main driver of food prices is not the price of beef and eggs, etc., although they're up. It's packaged goods. Packaged goods. You're going to see people not buying Kellogg's Raisin Bran, which you're going to see them buy another raisin bran, which would be a dollar cheaper. I mean, so what's happening is there is a real movement. We're better positioned than any country in the world, any major country in the world. And our economy is growing and is still in a place where it's leveling out in a rational means. The other thing is that I think you're going to see that people are looking to say, wow, price -- not only gas is down, but the price of I'm not getting charged for overdraft in my checks. I'm not getting charges, right? There's all kinds of things we're doing. And one of the big things was we were able to -- what we did with the Inflation Reduction Act is we reduce the cost of a lot of things for people, things that they need, prescription drugs. You know, the idea that the most senior citizen is going to have to pay for their drugs per year is 2,000. Some are paying 13,000 14,000, 15,000 because of cancer drugs. That changes. Two thousand max. If, in fact, they raise the price like they did on 1,200 prescription drugs last year for pharma companies, guess what? If they raise it higher than the price of inflation, they've got to pay it back to Medicare. So, there's a lot going on to reduce people's burdens. Because it's not record inflation anymore. I'm bringing it down. Look what we inherited. I inherited 69 percent unemployment. It's down to 3.5 percent. We have -- we lost 600 -- we lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. I've -- we've created over 600,000 -- 700,000 manufacturing jobs. Things are moving. As that report shows that you have people who are now in a position where the combination of pay raises and job security, they're now in a better off, even with inflation, than they were before it. And inflation is coming down. I think he -- if he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it? Why is he talking about the -- the -- the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this, and he should just get out -- he can end this all, get out of Ukraine. We're going to win that case. I think in the next two weeks you're going to see those checks going out. That's my response. Thank you, man. Appreciate it. Thank you. You guys are all over, aren't you? No, it's really quite -- I mean, I don't know whose idea it was, but it's a hell of an idea. Because you're going to -- No, I really mean it. It really matters. And -- and you're -- you're responding, in my view, how people live. They -- they don't have chance to sit in front of the news for, you know, 40, 50 minutes. You know, you're picking up what's happening around the world in -- in local communities. Congratulations. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. OK."
