speaker,transcript
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!"
Joey Tribbiani,Instead of...?
Joey Tribbiani,Never had that dream.
Joey Tribbiani,"This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh.
Joey Tribbiani,And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!"
Joey Tribbiani,I say push her down the stairs.
Joey Tribbiani,"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, like there's a rule or something?"
Joey Tribbiani,Who's Paul?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Paul!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Joey Tribbiani,What's this?
Joey Tribbiani,Which goes where?
Joey Tribbiani,Done with the bookcase!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
Joey Tribbiani,You got screwed.
Joey Tribbiani,Shut up!
Joey Tribbiani,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,"
Joey Tribbiani,Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Joey Tribbiani,Congratulations.
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning, Paul."
Joey Tribbiani,That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I'm an actor."
Joey Tribbiani,I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it was a job all right?"
Joey Tribbiani,I will not take this abuse.
Joey Tribbiani,"You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,Of course it was a line!
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
Joey Tribbiani,....Are we still talking about sex?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
Joey Tribbiani,".....Well, this is still ruined, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Your folks are really that bad, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Joey Tribbiani,"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Joey Tribbiani,"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."""
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks! Let's keep going.
Joey Tribbiani,"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."""
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Whoah!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette."
Joey Tribbiani,Y'miss it?
Joey Tribbiani,That's ridiculous!
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'okay, Phoebe?"
Joey Tribbiani,What are you talking about? Keep it!
Joey Tribbiani,So when do we get to meet the guy?
Joey Tribbiani,"Let it go, Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler! He's here!
Joey Tribbiani,Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Joey Tribbiani,Alan.
Joey Tribbiani,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ""you do, do you""?"
Joey Tribbiani,Do you have any respect for your body?
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, God!"
Joey Tribbiani,So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,Probably kill myself!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You are? Ross, I'm sorry.."
Joey Tribbiani,"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you."
Joey Tribbiani,"We love you, man."
Joey Tribbiani,So?
Joey Tribbiani,What's wrong with the twentieth?
Joey Tribbiani,"The hell with hockey, let's all do that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mon, Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job."
Joey Tribbiani,Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,-Peaches?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, how long do you think it'll be?"
Joey Tribbiani,"He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,With Carol? Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!"
Joey Tribbiani,Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
Joey Tribbiani,"No plans, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling."
Joey Tribbiani,"My god, Angela."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela."
Joey Tribbiani,You look good.
Joey Tribbiani,You don't say.
Joey Tribbiani,Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yep.
Joey Tribbiani,Which what?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but he's..."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my god.
Joey Tribbiani,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, they're close."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
Joey Tribbiani,Ow!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
Joey Tribbiani,Excellent.
Joey Tribbiani,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear."
Joey Tribbiani,"All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang..."
Joey Tribbiani,Whadja think?
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
Joey Tribbiani,"The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!"
Joey Tribbiani,Who's Rick?
Joey Tribbiani,I couldn't do it.
Joey Tribbiani,"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"""
Joey Tribbiani,...I'm his
Joey Tribbiani,"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
Joey Tribbiani,Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Joey Tribbiani,Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
Joey Tribbiani,Me?
Joey Tribbiani,Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm- I'm showering."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
Joey Tribbiani,I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Joey Tribbiani,Nope.
Joey Tribbiani,I got fired.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and..."
Joey Tribbiani,My mom will.
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hard to tell, I was naked."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah? That's so nice!
Joey Tribbiani,Hi everyone.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
Joey Tribbiani,What's up man?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen."
Joey Tribbiani,OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Joey Tribbiani,We have a winner!
Joey Tribbiani,It's never gonna happen.
Joey Tribbiani,You and Rachel.
Joey Tribbiani,"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
Joey Tribbiani,"Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'"
Joey Tribbiani,Are you going to do it?
Joey Tribbiani,Do you want any help?
Joey Tribbiani,"Good luck, man."
Joey Tribbiani,OK.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, where are you going?"
Joey Tribbiani,You can't go out there.
Joey Tribbiani,Because of... the reason.
Joey Tribbiani,"I, um, can't tell you."
Joey Tribbiani,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."
Joey Tribbiani,He's planning your birthday party.
Joey Tribbiani,You'd better act surprised.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sorry, that was wax."
Joey Tribbiani,Bwah-hah-hah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica."
Joey Tribbiani,Not me.
Joey Tribbiani,Twice?
Joey Tribbiani,You guys okay?
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Morning. We ready to go?
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
Joey Tribbiani,"Just a, uh... hearing disability."
Joey Tribbiani,Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
Joey Tribbiani,You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so..."
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,We did?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?"
Joey Tribbiani,I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
Joey Tribbiani,What's wrong?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait, wait, wait!"
Joey Tribbiani,So I guess you all saw it.
Joey Tribbiani,Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, will you just come in already?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
Joey Tribbiani,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease."
Joey Tribbiani,The balloon?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
Joey Tribbiani,That tone will not make me go any faster.
Joey Tribbiani,That one will.
Joey Tribbiani,"Nope, not that one."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
Joey Tribbiani,You call that delicious?
Joey Tribbiani,I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I will."
Joey Tribbiani,The bigger half.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
Joey Tribbiani,"I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nice shoes, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, four."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, kids..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Joey Tribbiani,"There y'go, kids."
Joey Tribbiani,You seen Sandy?
Joey Tribbiani,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Joey Tribbiani,"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
Joey Tribbiani,Alrightalrightalright. There.
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mon, she's your mom!"
Joey Tribbiani,Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Right. No big deal.
Joey Tribbiani,In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Joey Tribbiani,"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, how could you let this happen?"
Joey Tribbiani,You don't think my mom's sexy?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
Joey Tribbiani,He forgot to leave his grip size!
Joey Tribbiani,So are you gonna tell him?
Joey Tribbiani,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
Joey Tribbiani,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened."
Joey Tribbiani,"Me neither, y'know what-"
Joey Tribbiani,What are you mad at me for?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ah! Huh?
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
Joey Tribbiani,Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
Joey Tribbiani,"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"""
Joey Tribbiani,That makes more sense.
Joey Tribbiani,"I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
Joey Tribbiani,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!"
Joey Tribbiani,How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Joey Tribbiani,"I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands..."
Joey Tribbiani,Need a new table.
Joey Tribbiani,That's the rule.
Joey Tribbiani,How'd you get to that?
Joey Tribbiani,You knew about that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"Why, are you moving out?"
Joey Tribbiani,You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Joey Tribbiani,"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
Joey Tribbiani,So what's it gonna be?
Joey Tribbiani,Or an uncle...
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
Joey Tribbiani,Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Joey Tribbiani,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?"
Joey Tribbiani,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
Joey Tribbiani,Wha-
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dad, dad."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sure. So how long you been...
Joey Tribbiani,Since then?!
Joey Tribbiani,...I d'know.
Joey Tribbiani,You're one to talk.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Joey Tribbiani,"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!"
Joey Tribbiani,What's the matter with Rog?
Joey Tribbiani,"Night, you guys."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dad, Ronni's here."
Joey Tribbiani,Who-ah-ho.
Joey Tribbiani,No you won't.
Joey Tribbiani,If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend."
Joey Tribbiani,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni"
Joey Tribbiani,Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Joey Tribbiani,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Joey Tribbiani,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,You really think so?
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks, Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,What's the matter with you?!
Joey Tribbiani,Ma! What're you doing here?
Joey Tribbiani,Oww! Big ring!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hold on, you-you knew?"
Joey Tribbiani,"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm...happy...for you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Joey Tribbiani,With this ring? No contest.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
Joey Tribbiani,Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
Joey Tribbiani,You're in!
Joey Tribbiani,"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."""
Joey Tribbiani,Think it'll work?
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
Joey Tribbiani,"Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this."
Joey Tribbiani,How do I look?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down."
Joey Tribbiani,"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
Joey Tribbiani,"Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
Joey Tribbiani,We can't do that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, we might be leaving now."
Joey Tribbiani,"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
Joey Tribbiani,"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Joey Tribbiani,"If you don't do it, I will."
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,So what're you going to do?
Joey Tribbiani,"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
Joey Tribbiani,"So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
Joey Tribbiani,Mmmm. Good.
Joey Tribbiani,It's creamier.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Vulva?
Joey Tribbiani,Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Joey Tribbiani,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now."
Joey Tribbiani,....yeah... what else?
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, now you say something."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You want to see her again, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
Joey Tribbiani,There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Joey Tribbiani,Say it... say it!
Joey Tribbiani,You're not going to believe this!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
Joey Tribbiani,"And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again."
Joey Tribbiani,What a tool!
Joey Tribbiani,"So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Joey Tribbiani,You cuddled.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today."
Joey Tribbiani,Nope.
Joey Tribbiani,Nope.
Joey Tribbiani,Not from where I was standin.
Joey Tribbiani,"I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries."
Joey Tribbiani,She is so hot!
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs?
Joey Tribbiani,You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Joey Tribbiani,"So that if we went out on a date, shed be there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Cool, thanks."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise."
Joey Tribbiani,Yep. Ice Capades.
Joey Tribbiani,"I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Out.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You meant sex, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Joey Tribbiani,He should take the sack?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Joey Tribbiani,When's that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Your sister stood me up the other night.
Joey Tribbiani,"I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off."
Joey Tribbiani,Urse...
Joey Tribbiani,"..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, don't say ""listen."" I know that ""listen."" I've said that ""listen."""
Joey Tribbiani,I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
Joey Tribbiani,You don't drink.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Urse..."
Joey Tribbiani,Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Joey Tribbiani,"no. No, I, I couldn't do that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Then, uh, then I'm sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,I know...
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful."
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs?
Joey Tribbiani,We just got the message.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hola, amigos!"
Joey Tribbiani,Shut up!
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,"There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz..."
Joey Tribbiani,About what?
Joey Tribbiani,Heh... I was bluffing.
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?"
Joey Tribbiani,...Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand."
Joey Tribbiani,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza."
Joey Tribbiani,That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too. Alright, whattaya got."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. Oh, I'm out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
Joey Tribbiani,Check.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Here, I got five, I got five."
Joey Tribbiani,": Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Joey Tribbiani,Suck-fest.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity."
Joey Tribbiani,I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Joey Tribbiani,"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
Joey Tribbiani,She really said that?
Joey Tribbiani,'Tonight' tonight?
Joey Tribbiani,How could you lose him?
Joey Tribbiani,Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Joey Tribbiani,Marcel?
Joey Tribbiani,Marcel?
Joey Tribbiani,A monkey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. Then, no."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out."
Joey Tribbiani,Marcel?
Joey Tribbiani,"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex."
Joey Tribbiani,"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle."
Joey Tribbiani,Her answer machine?
Joey Tribbiani,"Duh, where've you been?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe she never got your message.
Joey Tribbiani,He's back! The peeper's back!
Joey Tribbiani,Get down!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,..Naughty!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah..."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
Joey Tribbiani,Big day.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
Joey Tribbiani,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
Joey Tribbiani,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not."
Joey Tribbiani,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Joey Tribbiani,"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
Joey Tribbiani,Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Joey Tribbiani,Where've you been?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! He beat ya.
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
Joey Tribbiani,Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Joey Tribbiani,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Joey Tribbiani,Did you call the cops?
Joey Tribbiani,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Joey Tribbiani,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Joey Tribbiani,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
Joey Tribbiani,"I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
Joey Tribbiani,"Marcel, I'm hungry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
Joey Tribbiani,Holden McGroin.
Joey Tribbiani,Exellent dream score.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. What are you wearing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you."
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Joey Tribbiani,How young is young Ethan? Young?
Joey Tribbiani,Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool."
Joey Tribbiani,"Services? Oh, services."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh... Yeah, you do."
Joey Tribbiani,My scones.
Joey Tribbiani,'My scones.'
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?"
Joey Tribbiani,Stegosaurus!
Joey Tribbiani,What about Andre?
Joey Tribbiani,They're here already?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, moist, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right."
Joey Tribbiani,For the ride.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'm going. I'm going."
Joey Tribbiani,Do we have to know about that?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
Joey Tribbiani,"Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Joey Tribbiani,"The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here."
Joey Tribbiani,Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it is."
Joey Tribbiani,It is.
Joey Tribbiani,Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Joey Tribbiani,"Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, just had a baby."
Joey Tribbiani,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
Joey Tribbiani,"He doesn't do much, does he?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
Joey Tribbiani,"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
Joey Tribbiani,Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
Joey Tribbiani,... It's a fertility study.
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
Joey Tribbiani,We make fire. Cook meat.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, OK."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,The country?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Joey Tribbiani,"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man."
Joey Tribbiani,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Then you do. Heh, heh."
Joey Tribbiani,What do you mean?
Joey Tribbiani,Not following you.
Joey Tribbiani,: That book got me through some tough times.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
Joey Tribbiani,The country.
Joey Tribbiani,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
Joey Tribbiani,"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,How do you mean?
Joey Tribbiani,Shhhh!
Joey Tribbiani,She's still asleep.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
Joey Tribbiani,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level."
Joey Tribbiani,I know! Neither did I!
Joey Tribbiani,Seven hundred bucks!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Um, this?"
Joey Tribbiani,What up?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you."
Joey Tribbiani,Needs some clothes altered?
Joey Tribbiani,"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, I think I was sixteen."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means."
Joey Tribbiani,Can we see her?
Joey Tribbiani,How're you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, that bad, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts."
Joey Tribbiani,You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Joey Tribbiani,What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
Joey Tribbiani,Frankie? What're you talking about?
Joey Tribbiani,No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?"
Joey Tribbiani,What? That's not? Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
Joey Tribbiani,"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
Joey Tribbiani,"I gotta get one, too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, does it hurt?"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?"
Joey Tribbiani,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Joey Tribbiani,Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Joey Tribbiani,Who?
Joey Tribbiani,What's he doin' in my section?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Bijan for men?
Joey Tribbiani,"Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!"
Joey Tribbiani,What is the big deal?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
Joey Tribbiani,Exactly.
Joey Tribbiani,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
Joey Tribbiani,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah I guess you're right.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna do it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Mornin'. I said, mornin'."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I'm ready."
Joey Tribbiani,"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts."
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys are messin' with me, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa."""
Joey Tribbiani,"""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Such as?
Joey Tribbiani,Check this out. Can I have this?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook."
Joey Tribbiani,"""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school."
Joey Tribbiani,That's what it says.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you were both dorks. Big deal."
Joey Tribbiani,Have you been here all night?
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Joey Tribbiani,"Geez, look how fat she got."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"
Joey Tribbiani,You want his yearbook?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?"
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it."
Joey Tribbiani,What happens if you flick it?
Joey Tribbiani,Foxy lady.
Joey Tribbiani,The Ice Capades?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people."
Joey Tribbiani,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . ."
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too, we should get goin'."
Joey Tribbiani,I got time.
Joey Tribbiani,"Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Here comes the beep, you know what to do."
Joey Tribbiani,Do we need a cake?
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there"". Like we can afford to go here and there."
Joey Tribbiani,For Ross.
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?"
Joey Tribbiani,Cool.
Joey Tribbiani,"Sorry, sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"What are these, like famous chickens?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you."
Joey Tribbiani,"'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--"
Joey Tribbiani,Charity.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel."
Joey Tribbiani,Me too.
Joey Tribbiani,Fine.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on you guys, one more time."
Joey Tribbiani,Nooo.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid."
Joey Tribbiani,You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Joey Tribbiani,And we don't work hard?
Joey Tribbiani,And you feel like we hold you back.
Joey Tribbiani,Let me get that. You got five bucks?
Joey Tribbiani,Cool.
Joey Tribbiani,"Goo, goo, goo, waaah!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you ok, Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,Is he gonna be ok?
Joey Tribbiani,"What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hat, milk, got it."
Joey Tribbiani,Consider it done.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, seriously."
Joey Tribbiani,You wanna smell him?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head."
Joey Tribbiani,What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, look at that talent."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Get outta here. This is our stop too.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm him.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks."
Joey Tribbiani,"Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Ahh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns."
Joey Tribbiani,You got a better idea?
Joey Tribbiani,Heads.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Whew!
Joey Tribbiani,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! There's still pie.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today."
Joey Tribbiani,"The guy still won't put out, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe he's. . . gay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?"
Joey Tribbiani,"But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?"
Joey Tribbiani,You're getting a cat?
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Phoebs.
Joey Tribbiani,I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,And?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right Phoebs, way to go."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, so how did it happen?"
Joey Tribbiani,And what did he say?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.
Joey Tribbiani,"Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
Joey Tribbiani,This man is my God.
Joey Tribbiani,Tongue?
Joey Tribbiani,Cool.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then..."
Joey Tribbiani,You got all that from saline solution?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first."
Joey Tribbiani,You could say that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?"
Joey Tribbiani,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, I do."
Joey Tribbiani,"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?"
Joey Tribbiani,You gave him cookies?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'."
Joey Tribbiani,C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Joey Tribbiani,"So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . ."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through."
Joey Tribbiani,She told us.
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, pigeons learn faster that you."
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, here she comes."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, big stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Sure is.
Joey Tribbiani,Good luck Phoebs.
Joey Tribbiani,How far'd ya get?
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebs, what's goin' on?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas."
Joey Tribbiani,"Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright."
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, these are for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
Joey Tribbiani,They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Joey Tribbiani,"When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm alright man. Really."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works."
Joey Tribbiani,I just had a glass.
Joey Tribbiani,Ooooooh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!"
Joey Tribbiani,With a man?
Joey Tribbiani,"What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?"
Joey Tribbiani,I've never slept with someone for a part.
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her."
Joey Tribbiani,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way."
Joey Tribbiani,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part."
Joey Tribbiani,"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!"
Joey Tribbiani,Alright... I've got to go shower.
Joey Tribbiani,"It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you really not going?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this."
Joey Tribbiani,"There's my scene, there's my scene. ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"""
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?"
Joey Tribbiani,They didn't fight a lot?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, look who's up."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!"
Joey Tribbiani,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly."
Joey Tribbiani,How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Joey Tribbiani,I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, my first fan mail."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, the stalker."
Joey Tribbiani,Let's get out of here.
Joey Tribbiani,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
Joey Tribbiani,She's comin'.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,Erica.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah it is. . . what?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
Joey Tribbiani,No one.
Joey Tribbiani,"Good, otherwise my watch would fall off."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something."
Joey Tribbiani,But that's what...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey I-
Joey Tribbiani,"That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey."
Joey Tribbiani,"Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God, quick turn off the TV."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Erica, c'mon in."
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,Who?
Joey Tribbiani,"It's not what you think, that was..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor."
Joey Tribbiani,Somebody wanna help me out here?
Joey Tribbiani,'Cause it's a television show.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not Drake.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care"
Joey Tribbiani,"OK, alright, the people who threw the water."
Joey Tribbiani,This is amazing.
Joey Tribbiani,I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Joey Tribbiani,Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Woah, dude, burn."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh."
Joey Tribbiani,You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons."
Joey Tribbiani,Oooh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?"
Joey Tribbiani,Forget about it.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities."
Joey Tribbiani,So what're you guys gonna eat?
Joey Tribbiani,Ma?
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you naked in there?
Joey Tribbiani,"Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, let me see."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing."
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler's wearing panties.
Joey Tribbiani,"Can't help you, I'm not wearing any."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie."
Joey Tribbiani,"One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye."
Joey Tribbiani,Aaaaagggghhhhh.

Joey Tribbiani,Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope."
Joey Tribbiani,Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Heh, what d'ya say?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out."
Joey Tribbiani,Put it on.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet."
Joey Tribbiani,You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Joey Tribbiani,"If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?"
Joey Tribbiani,You know what the. . .
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,How come you have two?
Joey Tribbiani,Get out.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?"
Joey Tribbiani,What is with your nose?
Joey Tribbiani,Some girl ate Monica.
Joey Tribbiani,Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking."
Joey Tribbiani,Alright open your eyes.
Joey Tribbiani,Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Joey Tribbiani,I know. chandler: Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. Not that one."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh yeah, that's the stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,We dare.
Joey Tribbiani,What if we have to pee?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Joey Tribbiani,She laughed at you?
Joey Tribbiani,It certainly is a miracle.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, inside good, outside bad."
Joey Tribbiani,"Naa, she's lyin'."
Joey Tribbiani,Is that the fire alarm?
Joey Tribbiani,Cool.
Joey Tribbiani,Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?"
Joey Tribbiani,So where you gettin' it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?"
Joey Tribbiani,Can you believe this place?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man."
Joey Tribbiani,Huh?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?"
Joey Tribbiani,Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Joey Tribbiani,"Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
Joey Tribbiani,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie."
Joey Tribbiani,Well that's how I feel.
Joey Tribbiani,Well then maybe I will.
Joey Tribbiani,"Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . ."
Joey Tribbiani,I know. Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, we're alright."
Joey Tribbiani,Plastic spoons. Great.
Joey Tribbiani,"These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry."
Joey Tribbiani,Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass."
Joey Tribbiani,"Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! And the table is mine.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street."
Joey Tribbiani,"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, I guess this is it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care."
Joey Tribbiani,Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Joey Tribbiani,Art.
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, I go-, I got it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. Heh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No no no, behind it."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, I have a phone in here."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Hello.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, well great."
Joey Tribbiani,Well OK then. Was that the oven timer?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, they're runnin'"
Joey Tribbiani,"I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think."
Joey Tribbiani,"You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Joey Tribbiani,"Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, now it's a spare room?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I uh, got what I came for. I'll uh, I'll see you guys."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah he is."
Joey Tribbiani,Eddie.
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?"
Joey Tribbiani,You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me."
Joey Tribbiani,So how you two gettin' along?
Joey Tribbiani,"Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man."
Joey Tribbiani,"Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Joey Tribbiani,It may not be a bed of roses.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Page 42, page 42, page 42."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, I look good."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'"
Joey Tribbiani,"Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?"
Joey Tribbiani,"They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son."
Joey Tribbiani,"No. No way, I'm not signing that."
Joey Tribbiani,How can they do this to me?
Joey Tribbiani,I don't feel like talkin.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin."
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, that means nothin to me."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache."
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Joey Tribbiani,Anybody want a croan.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, can we get back to me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Alright. Cab driver number two?
Joey Tribbiani,But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Joey Tribbiani,"But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm sorry. See ya.
Joey Tribbiani,What is it?
Joey Tribbiani,"See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh."
Joey Tribbiani,It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look at this, how did I spend so much money?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ahh.
Joey Tribbiani,"My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,That's a two line part.
Joey Tribbiani,So what.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I don't wanna hear this right now."
Joey Tribbiani,Well don't just say.
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show."
Joey Tribbiani,I fell down an elevator shaft.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything."
Joey Tribbiani,"And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting."
Joey Tribbiani,"No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose."
Joey Tribbiani,They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks Ross.
Joey Tribbiani,I went.
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't get it.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Huh?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, not my parrot."
Joey Tribbiani,I can't watch this.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register."
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
Joey Tribbiani,Hello.
Joey Tribbiani,I know I would.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey no problem.
Joey Tribbiani,"Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is..."
Joey Tribbiani,A little foos?
Joey Tribbiani,What happened to the foosball?
Joey Tribbiani,He paid a lot of money for it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats ."
Joey Tribbiani,No problem. Hey Chandler
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,He-he-eyy.
Joey Tribbiani,Ok. He kept my dollar.
Joey Tribbiani,How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
Joey Tribbiani,"Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game."
Joey Tribbiani,We're the guys.
Joey Tribbiani,Man you are incredible.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with."
Joey Tribbiani,"No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Nooooo.
Joey Tribbiani,Not a dad.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?"
Joey Tribbiani,Freaky.
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, relax, go get a beer."
Joey Tribbiani,Who said it was for you?
Joey Tribbiani,You're kiddin'.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back."
Joey Tribbiani,Do what?
Joey Tribbiani,"See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah good luck, good luck."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo."
Joey Tribbiani,"Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?"
Joey Tribbiani,Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, hey no."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will."
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50."
Joey Tribbiani,How come those?
Joey Tribbiani,That is so not my motto.
Joey Tribbiani,Good.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it."
Joey Tribbiani,It's a woman.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye."
Joey Tribbiani,Hard to say.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?"
Joey Tribbiani,By someone besides Monica?
Joey Tribbiani,"He-he-he, how's it goin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Excellent.
Joey Tribbiani,Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Joey Tribbiani,"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper."
Joey Tribbiani,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared."
Joey Tribbiani,"I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room."
Joey Tribbiani,Right this is staging.
Joey Tribbiani,This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
Joey Tribbiani,Quick volleyball question.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, you drive safe."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care."
Joey Tribbiani,Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, what happened?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I've had it."
Joey Tribbiani,But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
Joey Tribbiani,Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,I figure my character has kids.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did."
Joey Tribbiani,"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie."
Joey Tribbiani,What a phony.
Joey Tribbiani,Sir.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
Joey Tribbiani,This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Joey Tribbiani,"Joseph's good, isn't he?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Joey Tribbiani,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Joey Tribbiani,"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know."
Joey Tribbiani,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
Joey Tribbiani,Karen.
Joey Tribbiani,Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot."
Joey Tribbiani,Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Joey Tribbiani,All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses."
Joey Tribbiani,"I did do it, I'm a professional."
Joey Tribbiani,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, I need your help here."
Joey Tribbiani,"You see this, this is a friend."
Joey Tribbiani,Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that makes sense."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone."
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon ."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him"
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men."
Joey Tribbiani,"Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh ."
Joey Tribbiani,"Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
Joey Tribbiani,Good morning.
Joey Tribbiani,Kiss her! Kiss her!
Joey Tribbiani,B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, quite yankin' me."
Joey Tribbiani,This is Janice.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
Joey Tribbiani,Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Joey Tribbiani,Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Joey Tribbiani,There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wheel!
Joey Tribbiani,Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Joey Tribbiani,"I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, what do you want me to say?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
Joey Tribbiani,And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Joey Tribbiani,But what does that gonna do...
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. I'm in.
Joey Tribbiani,Does it have to be a whole day?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
Joey Tribbiani,"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium."
Joey Tribbiani,"No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!"
Joey Tribbiani,We have a half hour.
Joey Tribbiani,"Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Ross, want some cider?"
Joey Tribbiani,Glass of fat?
Joey Tribbiani,What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Joey Tribbiani,Am I in it?
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa!
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,How is this your seat?
Joey Tribbiani,But then you left.
Joey Tribbiani,"What's the big deal, sit somewhere else."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo..."
Joey Tribbiani,All right! You can have the chair.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my, would you look at that!"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm so sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable."
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, how are you gonna do that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy."
Joey Tribbiani,Now she sounded breezy.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions."
Joey Tribbiani,That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Joey Tribbiani,Where's my underwear?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now."
Joey Tribbiani,It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, opposite, is opposite!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
Joey Tribbiani,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed."
Joey Tribbiani,You could drink the fat.
Joey Tribbiani,Yaaaay!
Joey Tribbiani,Let's see what else he'll do!
Joey Tribbiani,WHOAA!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
Joey Tribbiani,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Joey Tribbiani,What is this? Fruit?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?"
Joey Tribbiani,This will just be my batch.
Joey Tribbiani,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Joey Tribbiani,You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean"
Joey Tribbiani,Aww. Ohh!
Joey Tribbiani,Put your hands together.
Joey Tribbiani,No more jam?!
Joey Tribbiani,Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, the Knicks rule!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Let me see. Oh, right."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left."
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little."
Joey Tribbiani,"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Where you going?
Joey Tribbiani,Sperm or regular?
Joey Tribbiani,"So you're really doing this, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sounds nice.
Joey Tribbiani,"No kiddin', hmm."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool."
Joey Tribbiani,He's got the body for it.
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. ."
Joey Tribbiani,"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person."
Joey Tribbiani,Did I get it?
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
Joey Tribbiani,Can we please turn this off?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Joey Tribbiani,How is it you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yep, that's my audition."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance."
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, what are you doing? What are you doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hang up, hang up."
Joey Tribbiani,I love that movie.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, it just felt nice."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know about that?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on baby, come on!"
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you so much.
Joey Tribbiani,"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nooo, four."
Joey Tribbiani,G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Joey Tribbiani,Go Joe!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs! There you are!
Joey Tribbiani,"But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's okay, these things happen."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm, I'm okay. See."
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
Joey Tribbiani,They actually said that?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, shoot."
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't get it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, what else?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
Joey Tribbiani,"You do, thanks."
Joey Tribbiani,Wait a minute.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent."
Joey Tribbiani,That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's."
Joey Tribbiani,Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Joey Tribbiani,Her what?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Monica, who would yours be?"
Joey Tribbiani,"It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey!
Joey Tribbiani,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
Joey Tribbiani,"Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it."
Joey Tribbiani,Eh! There you go.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, very official."
Joey Tribbiani,Why don't we just go on two.
Joey Tribbiani,Because it's faster.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, but in the future..."
Joey Tribbiani,So we are going on two?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, it's big!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe, my ruler's wrong."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what?
Joey Tribbiani,I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
Joey Tribbiani,"Get out your checkbook, mister."
Joey Tribbiani,You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that's really a different question."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, there's a dog out there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's a uh, that's a tough combination."
Joey Tribbiani,Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Joey Tribbiani,Gotcha.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you bet I am!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh right, right."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk."
Joey Tribbiani,Baywatch.
Joey Tribbiani,Lifeguards.
Joey Tribbiani,Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Joey Tribbiani,"They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here."
Joey Tribbiani,Cool!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?"
Joey Tribbiani,Booo!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys!"
Joey Tribbiani,Guess what?
Joey Tribbiani,I got a gig!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community."
Joey Tribbiani,I know!
Joey Tribbiani,"Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?"
Joey Tribbiani,You want me to lie to Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this."
Joey Tribbiani,Ahh!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey now!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, great."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,All right. I can't see.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud."
Joey Tribbiani,You bet! What's the part?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa. That was really good.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I-I might've said supergay."
Joey Tribbiani,"Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part."
Joey Tribbiani,"There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not."
Joey Tribbiani,"It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him."
Joey Tribbiani,Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Joey Tribbiani,What did they do?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,I've got a science question.
Joey Tribbiani,"If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, I'm not judging."
Joey Tribbiani,I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
Joey Tribbiani,They were in his office.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm telling you man, I saw it."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,You said number two.
Joey Tribbiani,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh.
Joey Tribbiani,Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, now we got a reason."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, what's a matter?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God, is she going back to him?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What are you ah, what are you gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it doesn't matter what I would do."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out."
Joey Tribbiani,"They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Great, you can cover Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on."
Joey Tribbiani,Says who? Your mom?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, we have to pick captains."
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, huddle up, right over here."
Joey Tribbiani,I got it.
Joey Tribbiani,One-Mississippi. Two-Mississippi. Three-Mississippi.
Joey Tribbiani,Set....hike!
Joey Tribbiani,"Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi-hi, I'm Joey."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit."
Joey Tribbiani,"Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan."
Joey Tribbiani,Mar-klan.
Joey Tribbiani,I think so.
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,Fumble!
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself."
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, run!"
Joey Tribbiani,After!!
Joey Tribbiani,"It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl."
Joey Tribbiani,What are you gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Here you go!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania."
Joey Tribbiani,Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now."
Joey Tribbiani,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
Joey Tribbiani,Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Joey Tribbiani,"This sucks, I was just up by that much!"
Joey Tribbiani,Thirty seconds left on the timer!
Joey Tribbiani,"When they're hungry enough, they'll come in."
Joey Tribbiani,And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Joey Tribbiani,What? Me having a job?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure.
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back."
Joey Tribbiani,Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, they go into the chipper."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Hey!!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?"
Joey Tribbiani,"If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I got great news!
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?"
Joey Tribbiani,Not a problem.
Joey Tribbiani,And now for the great news.
Joey Tribbiani,"Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper."
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here."
Joey Tribbiani,Merry Christmas!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't tell you that, no."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around..."
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, only for sex."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Can I talk to you for a second?!
Joey Tribbiani,Come on!!
Joey Tribbiani,I just got off the phone with my sister.
Joey Tribbiani,Mary-Angela.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister."
Joey Tribbiani,"Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree."
Joey Tribbiani,Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Joey Tribbiani,"You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,She's right in there.
Joey Tribbiani,What's goin' on?
Joey Tribbiani,"What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,"No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Cookie, now you can punch him!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Joey Tribbiani,"It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Who?
Joey Tribbiani,The what?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, okay. The what?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two.........."
Joey Tribbiani,Really? Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,"Excellent, I'll be there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I can dance, y'know."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing."
Joey Tribbiani,Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?"
Joey Tribbiani,The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, I'm not done."
Joey Tribbiani,Done.
Joey Tribbiani,Mark's a genius!
Joey Tribbiani,"And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
Joey Tribbiani,"So, does that mean the audition is off?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands."
Joey Tribbiani,Bye.
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, it was the best I could get out of them."
Joey Tribbiani,"People, people, people."
Joey Tribbiani,Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Joey Tribbiani,Cool.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late."
Joey Tribbiani,I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
Joey Tribbiani,Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Joey Tribbiani,"The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you got it."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women."
Joey Tribbiani,"How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?"
Joey Tribbiani,These little women. Wow!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
Joey Tribbiani,But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Joey Tribbiani,No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Joey Tribbiani,"What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! How's it going?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub..."
Joey Tribbiani,All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad."
Joey Tribbiani,"Beth, Beth dies?"
Joey Tribbiani,Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Joey Tribbiani,Then why would you say that?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Beth is really, really sick."
Joey Tribbiani,"Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! This girl is good.
Joey Tribbiani,"So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
Joey Tribbiani,Home is Home Star stew.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, that was kinda brutal."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Phew, close one."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Is ah, is Chandler around?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oooh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner...."
Joey Tribbiani,"I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log."
Joey Tribbiani,"I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg."
Joey Tribbiani,I ran!!
Joey Tribbiani,Morning.
Joey Tribbiani,Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. You okay?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Where have you been?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?"
Joey Tribbiani,Done.
Joey Tribbiani,So Pheebs what's this guy like?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it."
Joey Tribbiani,Both of us?
Joey Tribbiani,We'll be there.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, 10:30."
Joey Tribbiani,4:30.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
Joey Tribbiani,She was kidding about that right?
Joey Tribbiani,"God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I don't know."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?"
Joey Tribbiani,So what are you gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing, he's just really believes in that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?"
Joey Tribbiani,The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?"
Joey Tribbiani,Don't answer that.
Joey Tribbiani,Awful! Horrible!
Joey Tribbiani,She was nothing compared to you.
Joey Tribbiani,Ewwwww!
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore."
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?! I'm hungry.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we'll be fine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza."
Joey Tribbiani,You think I need a new walk?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe she killed him?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I really have to pee."
Joey Tribbiani,Can I see the comics?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, may I see the comics?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you shoulda been there last night."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler...."
Joey Tribbiani,Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now."
Joey Tribbiani,I had the same dream!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I had the opposite dream."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship."
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?"

Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,What? Mine aren't tinted.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, now I have to go!!"
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,"Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!"
Joey Tribbiani,Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire."
Joey Tribbiani,"If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
Joey Tribbiani,And there you go!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."

Joey Tribbiani,I know! That's why they trashed me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute."
Joey Tribbiani,"I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Kate, do you even like me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?"
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Okay, okay, hey. There we go, let's get your feet up there. Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!"
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,You-you think?
Joey Tribbiani,"Two brothers, one died!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sorry! Sorry, I'm late; sorry, I'm late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly."
Joey Tribbiani,Where's Kate?
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ahh, go to the window. I'm wanna run down to the truck and show you something."
Joey Tribbiani,When is she leaving?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm coming up!

Joey Tribbiani,"But, but wh-what about us?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, so, stay for the museums!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye."
Joey Tribbiani,In a minute!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I guess it is. Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck."
Joey Tribbiani,What was it?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, right."
Joey Tribbiani,"So Pheebs, do they know about each other?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Well?!
Joey Tribbiani,Well what is it?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV."
Joey Tribbiani,Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi, how ya doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Tell us!
Joey Tribbiani,So you're the gynaecologist?
Joey Tribbiani,"And it's not fake, it's totally brutal."
Joey Tribbiani,"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. What are we getting?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, the fight's starting!"
Joey Tribbiani,Fight's over!
Joey Tribbiani,"Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!"
Joey Tribbiani,No-o-o!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I think we all learned something."
Joey Tribbiani,That you're actually 50?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Bonnie had sex there!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's just my luggage."
Joey Tribbiani,Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, check out the hat!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it's like a law!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, all right."
Joey Tribbiani,Fan out! Fan out!
Joey Tribbiani,OH YES!!!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well, I couldn't find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, relax. It's just a shoe."
Joey Tribbiani,Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, y'know it's kinda cold, so how about I keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?"
Joey Tribbiani,We're playing Strip Happy Days Game!
Joey Tribbiani,"What's the matter, Pheebs?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,But I made cards!!
Joey Tribbiani,Wanna play strip poker for practice?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!"
Joey Tribbiani,"So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! Check this baby out, dug me a hole!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Joey Tribbiani,What?! What?!! What is it?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there's really only one thing you can do."
Joey Tribbiani,You're gonna have to pee on it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel."
Joey Tribbiani,If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Joey Tribbiani,Me too.
Joey Tribbiani,No?
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's between us and the sea, Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,Nope.
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It's eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish."
Joey Tribbiani,And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Joey Tribbiani,I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn't. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Joey Tribbiani,"How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them."
Joey Tribbiani,"Looks good, uh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!"
Joey Tribbiani,What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. What do you do?
Joey Tribbiani,What? What's wrong?
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out."
Joey Tribbiani,Pretty nice?
Joey Tribbiani,Good for you!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, Pheebs, about your mom..."
Joey Tribbiani,How's that going?
Joey Tribbiani,That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Joey Tribbiani,"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. See?! I told ya!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!"
Joey Tribbiani,WHAT?!!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah...
Joey Tribbiani,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Joey Tribbiani,Huh?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!"
Joey Tribbiani,Just pickle.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant."
Joey Tribbiani,Uhhhh.
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Joey Tribbiani,He cut off his ear.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm out.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Joey Tribbiani,"In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer."
Joey Tribbiani,Spock's birth control.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
Joey Tribbiani,"Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'."
Joey Tribbiani,"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!"
Joey Tribbiani,"And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Wh-what's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,No he doesn't!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right that's it, school is in session!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord."
Joey Tribbiani,"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
Joey Tribbiani,I have actually not heard of that.
Joey Tribbiani,Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later."
Joey Tribbiani,"He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later."
Joey Tribbiani,Well he made Rachel cry!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine."
Joey Tribbiani,"No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, absolutely."
Joey Tribbiani,"What, what is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's not, prison lingo, is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet."
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, thank you."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'm here, let's ahh, get this over with."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on man, you're not a potato."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again. Come on. Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y'know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a- We-he!! Hey!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,No I didn't.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm not! And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know how to lead.
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"So you ah, ready for our last practice?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, you wanna use our place?"
Joey Tribbiani,We did it!!
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, okay, good luck."
Joey Tribbiani,Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Go get 'em Treeger.
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm good."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?"
Joey Tribbiani,It's 4:30.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I see what's going on here."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Is she great or what?
Joey Tribbiani,I'll be right back. What was that?
Joey Tribbiani,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Joey Tribbiani,"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well then, do it better!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,You can pee here!
Joey Tribbiani,"We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I know..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls."
Joey Tribbiani,It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"""
Joey Tribbiani,She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?"
Joey Tribbiani,Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place."
Joey Tribbiani,What kind of smell?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You wanna see her again, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Joey Tribbiani,"Our place, the hall! I..."
Joey Tribbiani,A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Joey Tribbiani,"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. ."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that coupon expires, you know."
Joey Tribbiani,"Great! All right, so I'll call you later."
Joey Tribbiani,That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Joey Tribbiani,What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Joey Tribbiani,You got all that from the back of her head?
Joey Tribbiani,Who's Elaine?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble."
Joey Tribbiani,"We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can."
Joey Tribbiani,"'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey dude, it's me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog."
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize."
Joey Tribbiani,Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you're amazing."
Joey Tribbiani,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, Kathy."
Joey Tribbiani,"No. No, Kathy."
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now."
Joey Tribbiani,What's up?
Joey Tribbiani,You do?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she broke up with me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Joey Tribbiani,"But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So..."
Joey Tribbiani,Who?
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!! That's even worse!!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! But it's the same!
Joey Tribbiani,Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Joey Tribbiani,"Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you."
Joey Tribbiani,Hello.
Joey Tribbiani,Hello.
Joey Tribbiani,Stop callin'!!
Joey Tribbiani,All right!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Joey Tribbiani,No! I'm putting that in my room.
Joey Tribbiani,"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?"
Joey Tribbiani,Five years.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,
Joey Tribbiani,My folks.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Joey Tribbiani,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!"
Joey Tribbiani,We've got a box.
Joey Tribbiani,What's twisted?
Joey Tribbiani,Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Joey Tribbiani,He's fine!
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,He's doin' some thinkin'!
Joey Tribbiani,You kissed my girlfriend!
Joey Tribbiani,That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!"
Joey Tribbiani,So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Joey Tribbiani,That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,I'll get it.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
Joey Tribbiani,In the box.
Joey Tribbiani,Open the box!!
Joey Tribbiani,"He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there."
Joey Tribbiani,Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police."
Joey Tribbiani,I think I know that girl.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, I definitely know her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, why do you call him Gandolf?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I had sex in high school."
Joey Tribbiani,"Will you calm down, he's just a human guy."
Joey Tribbiani,Really?!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'll see you guys."
Joey Tribbiani,"I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Joey Tribbiani,So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Joey Tribbiani,So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we could do that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, we're having fun, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you serious?!
Joey Tribbiani,Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Joey Tribbiani,"We're 29, we're not women."
Joey Tribbiani,"Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Good enough to get fired.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! Where are the seats?
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Damn!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?"
Joey Tribbiani,You got it! Oh-oh!
Joey Tribbiani,It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
Joey Tribbiani,There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Joey Tribbiani,No ma'am.
Joey Tribbiani,"I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Joey Tribbiani,"You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all."
Joey Tribbiani,What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Joey Tribbiani,Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Joey Tribbiani,Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Joey Tribbiani,Lean-lean-lean!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. ""And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic."
Joey Tribbiani,You're really thinking about having sex with your brother?!
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period."
Joey Tribbiani,"Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, we have a large foot. Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. Everyone wave 'Hi' to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. Okay, moving right along. Come on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, how-how come?"
Joey Tribbiani,That's crazy.
Joey Tribbiani,"I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Whatever.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow."
Joey Tribbiani,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
Joey Tribbiani,It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Joey Tribbiani,Good luck. And I'm still right!
Joey Tribbiani,She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, what's that about?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah? Ross, how many items left in that bag?"
Joey Tribbiani,Six.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, we'll start with...apples."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, the last thing..."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, not for like another two weeks."
Joey Tribbiani,Serious?
Joey Tribbiani,"No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?"
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.
Joey Tribbiani,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,Animals dressed as humans.
Joey Tribbiani,The Irish gig guy?!
Joey Tribbiani,It's All Relative.
Joey Tribbiani,Nana?
Joey Tribbiani,Althea!
Joey Tribbiani,I took a shot.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, no way, that rooster's family!"
Joey Tribbiani,What do you have against the duck?! He doesn't make any noise!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, we are not gonna..."
Joey Tribbiani,Dah!!
Joey Tribbiani,Oooooh!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Big fat goalie.
Joey Tribbiani,Weekend at Bernie's.
Joey Tribbiani,Everyday use.
Joey Tribbiani,Guest.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, 11!"
Joey Tribbiani,I call Monica's room!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I'm sight of the room and I called it."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-ooh Pheebs, are they in there?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh wow! You can tell this soon.
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"You can't just ignore the bet! It's a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, don't get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!"
Joey Tribbiani,But it is our apartment!
Joey Tribbiani,Did you see the size of the closets?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,There's gravy?
Joey Tribbiani,I think I left a donut up here.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,That-that is a good trick.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them."
Joey Tribbiani,Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
Joey Tribbiani,Noooo!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Joey Tribbiani,Yep! Grab a plate.
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer."
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, who's playing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, it smells good."
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! The new Playboy!
Joey Tribbiani,Come here.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, totally! That's such a turn-on!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-ooh, that's the turn-on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin'?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?"
Joey Tribbiani,What the heck is that?
Joey Tribbiani,"No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, for next time, what do you say?"
Joey Tribbiani,What's ready?
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, it looks the same."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,How'd it go?
Joey Tribbiani,Guggly worm.
Joey Tribbiani,Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with your life?"" stuff. I can say, ""Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two."
Joey Tribbiani,Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Joey Tribbiani,"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God, you guys have no idea."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey buddy! How's it going?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time! They're just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, it's uh, it's Heston."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice."
Joey Tribbiani,"Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?"
Joey Tribbiani,Interesting.
Joey Tribbiani,How ya doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,"I guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, I'm one of the cops that won't work with you 'cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I stink!"

Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Ah!!
Joey Tribbiani,And there it is.
Joey Tribbiani,So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! What's up?
Joey Tribbiani,I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, what's going on?"
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks for telling me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross! They're gonna kill you!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's...Chandler!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are."
Joey Tribbiani,I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,The Red Ross! Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sure."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what have you guys been up too?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, what' going on?"
Joey Tribbiani,Awwww!
Joey Tribbiani,What-what-what is so funny?
Joey Tribbiani,Now that's a thinker.
Joey Tribbiani,A little salami.
Joey Tribbiani,Pastrami.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra."
Joey Tribbiani,There was a seen in Footloose...
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl..."
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy."
Joey Tribbiani,Welcome to America.
Joey Tribbiani,"If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!"
Joey Tribbiani,Feel better now?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I eat a lot of meat right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals."
Joey Tribbiani,"Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Are you all right?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, time to take off the bra."
Joey Tribbiani,Take the bra off.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oooh, what you got there?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?"
Joey Tribbiani,What is that?
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Joey Tribbiani,Why would he turn off the TV?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he likes porn."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!"
Joey Tribbiani,You play hard to get.
Joey Tribbiani,Then you go to Tokyo.
Joey Tribbiani,"Way to be strong, man!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing. No, nothing."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!"
Joey Tribbiani,Noo! Nothing!
Joey Tribbiani,I think you're right.
Joey Tribbiani,One.
Joey Tribbiani,That's kinda nice.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they're hanging out with Joey."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there."
Joey Tribbiani,What do ya say? What do ya say?
Joey Tribbiani,I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but I'm gonna!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,Someone you didn't make up!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that guy really hurt us."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,So I guess it's Joey then!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
Joey Tribbiani,It's not that bad.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you're just Bing?"
Joey Tribbiani,No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Joey Tribbiani,"See you later, Gene."
Joey Tribbiani,What's up with Gene?
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh!
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Joey Tribbiani,"See, this is a great apartment."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants."
Joey Tribbiani,You have Knicks tickets?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you do!"
Joey Tribbiani,Come on!
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,We don't make enough fun of you already?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!"
Joey Tribbiani,It's the Knicks!
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa!
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, the Knicks rule all!"
Joey Tribbiani,Done!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, we could end up with nothing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, I like that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend."
Joey Tribbiani,All right!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,What's the game?! What's the game?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, they're tall."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Okay. Ace!
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!"
Joey Tribbiani,Why?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't want to move again!
Joey Tribbiani,That was one good minute!
Joey Tribbiani,Good night.
Joey Tribbiani,Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Monica and Rachel made out.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Get into gear!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you should here me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby and leave me alone"" clinic!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohhh, yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it."
Joey Tribbiani,That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
Joey Tribbiani,You can't do anything!
Joey Tribbiani,This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well."
Joey Tribbiani,I am... free!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
Joey Tribbiani,Joey Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,So why don't you give me your number?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey you guys! What's happening?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore."
Joey Tribbiani,I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! I am trying to sleep!
Joey Tribbiani,I know. Ross is getting married.
Joey Tribbiani,Everybody's doing stuff!
Joey Tribbiani,We could climb Mt. Everest!
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Joey Tribbiani,We could get that Everest video though.
Joey Tribbiani,"And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah we are!
Joey Tribbiani,It's never gonna happen.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find..."
Joey Tribbiani,Don't answer that.
Joey Tribbiani,Awful! Horrible!
Joey Tribbiani,She was nothing compared to you.
Joey Tribbiani,Ewwwww!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, ""Handkerchief?"" ""No-no, I got my invitation."""
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him."
Joey Tribbiani,"I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces."
Joey Tribbiani,Heyyy.
Joey Tribbiani,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
Joey Tribbiani,Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Joey Tribbiani,It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Joey Tribbiani,"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!"
Joey Tribbiani,I'll never get to be a best man!
Joey Tribbiani,What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you're not picking me.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Shame about you man.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Nooo, later."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you bachelors?
Joey Tribbiani,Are you strippers?
Joey Tribbiani,Then you're not invited.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-whoa, what party?"
Joey Tribbiani,Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
Joey Tribbiani,"This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Joey Tribbiani,You got it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I chose not to hear that."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, little party favours, check it out!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh-oh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, stripper!"
Joey Tribbiani,"The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!"
Joey Tribbiani,The ring is gone!
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!"
Joey Tribbiani,Of course!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey...
Joey Tribbiani,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, the stripper stole it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders."
Joey Tribbiani,"I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, ""If I bothered them again they'd call the police."" I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong."
Joey Tribbiani,"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!"
Joey Tribbiani,If anything should happen to him...
Joey Tribbiani,So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm so worried about him, y'know?"
Joey Tribbiani,H-h-h-how's the duck?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man."
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, don't argue with me..."
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,I gotta go check something over here.
Joey Tribbiani,What do you got there?
Joey Tribbiani,How come the writing is in Spanish?
Joey Tribbiani,"It's all London, baby! Here we go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh!!
Joey Tribbiani,Woo-hoo!!
Joey Tribbiani,London baby!
Joey Tribbiani,London baby!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Bye, Pheebs!"
Joey Tribbiani,London baby!!
Joey Tribbiani,Come on! Do something!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map."
Joey Tribbiani,I got it! Here we go.
Joey Tribbiani,"Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,Really? To what?
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, you are Westminster Crabby."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I like it. Here you go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,"How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,Me too.
Joey Tribbiani,"Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring."
Joey Tribbiani,Sh-shh-shh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,That's Fergie baby!!
Joey Tribbiani,"So, I hear you're single now..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!"
Joey Tribbiani,Wait up!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!"
Joey Tribbiani,"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I don't think so."
Joey Tribbiani,Who's seven?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
Joey Tribbiani,What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Joey Tribbiani,Two pizzas?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait, well, where did you get it from?!"
Joey Tribbiani,What's in it?
Joey Tribbiani,"That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like."
Joey Tribbiani,Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart."
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh great!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"But, he loves Emily?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Joey Tribbiani,Right!
Joey Tribbiani,Do something..... Something....
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Have you seen Monica?
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
Joey Tribbiani,I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Joey Tribbiani,"Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Felicity."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh great!! Hello.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her ""Hey."" And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that went well. Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You and me, next dance?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so..."
Joey Tribbiani,You spit on me man!
Joey Tribbiani,"Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"
Joey Tribbiani,My Giant? I love that movie!
Joey Tribbiani,Can I ask you something?
Joey Tribbiani,"Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks man.
Joey Tribbiani,But what about how much taller he is than me?
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
Joey Tribbiani,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
Joey Tribbiani,"Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that went well. Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so..."
Joey Tribbiani,You spit on me man!
Joey Tribbiani,"Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"
Joey Tribbiani,My Giant? I love that movie!
Joey Tribbiani,Can I ask you something?
Joey Tribbiani,"Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks man.
Joey Tribbiani,But what about how much taller he is than me?
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
Joey Tribbiani,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
Joey Tribbiani,"Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Joey Tribbiani,All right!
Joey Tribbiani,Mornin' Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,Was his name Angus?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Ross, Bodington's!"
Joey Tribbiani,That was good beer.
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys."
Joey Tribbiani,Later!
Joey Tribbiani,I bet it was about her a little.
Joey Tribbiani,Say that to him and you're golden.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Pheebs!"
Joey Tribbiani,See ya!! What the hell was that?!
Joey Tribbiani,Havin' some trouble?
Joey Tribbiani,I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Joey Tribbiani,All right. Good deal.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, okay, Pheebs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, all of us! All day!"
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe!
Joey Tribbiani,Mine!
Joey Tribbiani,"Nooo, I said we needed a new plan."
Joey Tribbiani,"Which, is the new plan!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?"
Joey Tribbiani,I gotta get the before shot!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, something hurts!"
Joey Tribbiani,Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my!
Joey Tribbiani,Not in my head.
Joey Tribbiani,Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I was bummed too."
Joey Tribbiani,I think Saturday-.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, well, what else could it be?"
Joey Tribbiani,Or?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, get these things out of me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!"
Joey Tribbiani,Argh!
Joey Tribbiani,Argh!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani,They're so small!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!"
Joey Tribbiani,He's talking to London!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!"
Joey Tribbiani,"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, may I ask for one example?"
Joey Tribbiani,That's because all people are selfish.
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?"
Joey Tribbiani,That he doesn't exist.
Joey Tribbiani,How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Joey Tribbiani,"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
Joey Tribbiani,But I'm the host!
Joey Tribbiani,"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Mon!
Joey Tribbiani,"See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hello New York!
Joey Tribbiani,PBS telethon.
Joey Tribbiani,What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Come on man! You've been here all day!
Joey Tribbiani,PBS Telethon.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Joey Tribbiani,"A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks."
Joey Tribbiani,Monica? What time is it?
Joey Tribbiani,But it's dark out.
Joey Tribbiani,I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here."
Joey Tribbiani,You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you're back!"
Joey Tribbiani,How was your conference?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you're back too!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how was your chef thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,What are you guys woofing about?
Joey Tribbiani,"Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!"
Joey Tribbiani,You want my advice?
Joey Tribbiani,You're not gonna like it.
Joey Tribbiani,You got married to fast.
Joey Tribbiani,I told ya.
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi, Rach."
Joey Tribbiani,"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you're not Kip!"
Joey Tribbiani,Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that poor bastard."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room."
Joey Tribbiani,'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Joey Tribbiani,Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Joey Tribbiani,You?! And-and you?!
Joey Tribbiani,How?! When?!
Joey Tribbiani,IN LONDON!!!
Joey Tribbiani,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, I don't want to see that!"
Joey Tribbiani,I guess I'm done.
Joey Tribbiani,I think I'm gonna take-off.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about."
Joey Tribbiani,I can hear that!
Joey Tribbiani,I can still hear you!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool."
Joey Tribbiani,I'll take it!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?"
Joey Tribbiani,What's the matter Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Joey Tribbiani,"Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you fogged Danny."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy."
Joey Tribbiani,We all hate Emily!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Joey Tribbiani,I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone..."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not sure.
Joey Tribbiani,RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor..."
Joey Tribbiani,It's almost as if he knew.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!"
Joey Tribbiani,I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Joey Tribbiani,"You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!"
Joey Tribbiani,What happened? What happened?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, look."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her."
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,"Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, all right!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You're fake laughing too, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing.
Joey Tribbiani,Kinda.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, you should've gone out once and a while."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhhhhhhhhh...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, the quiet down thing!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game."
Joey Tribbiani,YES!!
Joey Tribbiani,Um-hmm.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, yum!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mine!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
Joey Tribbiani,But it's available now! Isn't it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, let's go look at it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place."
Joey Tribbiani,"But hey, Ross, this place is available now!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's perfect!"
Joey Tribbiani,He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,You're kidding!
Joey Tribbiani,"But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!"
Joey Tribbiani,Definitely!
Joey Tribbiani,All right!
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!"
Joey Tribbiani,I need something sweet.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs."
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe?
Joey Tribbiani,Look.
Joey Tribbiani,I know! It's stuck!!!
Joey Tribbiani,I put it on to scare Chandler!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here."
Joey Tribbiani,It's Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,I can't! It-it's stuck!
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry! Sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,"It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you are! I scared you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, ""Butternut squash?"" And it came out, ""Squatternut buash?"""
Joey Tribbiani,You're a dork.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they're mine."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes."
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler? A word.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! But, you do it with me once."
Joey Tribbiani,Didn't think so.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Pheebs!"
Joey Tribbiani,What's wrong buddy?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Joey Tribbiani,"So you uh, still wondering?"
Joey Tribbiani,You're smart. I like that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hiya.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films."
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Joey Tribbiani,No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!! No I'm not!!
Joey Tribbiani,No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Joey Tribbiani,"No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!"
Joey Tribbiani,I slept with Monica.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London."
Joey Tribbiani,Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Joey Tribbiani,Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Joey Tribbiani,"No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!"
Joey Tribbiani,That makes sense!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, Monica?"
Joey Tribbiani,But sadly I could not be enticed.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs."
Joey Tribbiani,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,Why are you doing this?
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh."
Joey Tribbiani,Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Joey Tribbiani,"But, I love you."
Joey Tribbiani,And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
Joey Tribbiani,"So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?"
Joey Tribbiani,How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Joey Tribbiani,She's a woman!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, is there anything else?"
Joey Tribbiani,That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a second, I could star in it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it."
Joey Tribbiani,Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks!
Joey Tribbiani,Done!
Joey Tribbiani,It's not.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?"
Joey Tribbiani,Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Joey Tribbiani,You're driving me crazy with that!
Joey Tribbiani,Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh yeah, right here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."
Joey Tribbiani,"You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't finish my five pages.
Joey Tribbiani,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on look guys, don't fight."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
Joey Tribbiani,They're brother and sister!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Joey Tribbiani,"No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. ""It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out."" Ross"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going."
Joey Tribbiani,"A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out."
Joey Tribbiani,What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Joey Tribbiani,What's the matter?!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'll take care of it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister."
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, great!"
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight."
Joey Tribbiani,"So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,So did that do anything for ya?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true."
Joey Tribbiani,Really? Who-who have you taught?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,"Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?"
Joey Tribbiani,You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
Joey Tribbiani,"See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson."
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, okay."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and..."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,You look like a freak.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes! Yes, I did."
Joey Tribbiani,G-sharp.
Joey Tribbiani,What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Your other student, was you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, Chandler's not here."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Nice!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross? You okay?
Joey Tribbiani,"Really?! Uhh, what color is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place."
Joey Tribbiani,"What-what is it, what is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!"
Joey Tribbiani,And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not listening to you!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Pheebs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! Cool!
Joey Tribbiani,Was the chord at least right...
Joey Tribbiani,Howdy partner!
Joey Tribbiani,Umm?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,Now? You want me to go over there now?
Joey Tribbiani,Do you know something?
Joey Tribbiani,I might know something.
Joey Tribbiani,What's the thing you know?
Joey Tribbiani,I can't tell you what I know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, fine."
Joey Tribbiani,You don't know!
Joey Tribbiani,YOU KNOW!!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know!!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain."
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it."
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, I know one thing!"
Joey Tribbiani,They did it right there on the couch.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Ross!
Joey Tribbiani,Anybody gonna eat that?
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, let's go Pheebs."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
Joey Tribbiani,He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Joey Tribbiani,He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind."
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit Phoebe!!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Joey Tribbiani,"Judge rules, no violation."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Joey Tribbiani,"Judge rules, Nutter-Butter."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, hi."
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this."
Joey Tribbiani,"Great! Thanks, Rach!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Are you all right?
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs! Sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
Joey Tribbiani,Really? A purse?
Joey Tribbiani,It looks like a women's purse.
Joey Tribbiani,"See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but sandwich time is right now."
Joey Tribbiani,Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Joey Tribbiani,Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you."
Joey Tribbiani,U-N-I-sexy?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Here, I brought you some flowers."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me."
Joey Tribbiani,What did you say to him?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, first it's not a purse."
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah but I didn't read anything.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Estelle said I didn't get it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!"
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys!
Joey Tribbiani,What? What?
Joey Tribbiani,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them."
Joey Tribbiani,I can't take any...
Joey Tribbiani,Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal."
Joey Tribbiani,Ugh.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Well I didn't tell them!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
Joey Tribbiani,And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!"
Joey Tribbiani,No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm listening.
Joey Tribbiani,So he likes to break stuff.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,They know you know.
Joey Tribbiani,I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh!
Joey Tribbiani,"I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!"
Joey Tribbiani,It's not my first time.
Joey Tribbiani,Dude!
Joey Tribbiani,All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! He's right there!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister."
Joey Tribbiani,I call Godfather!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, if you cared enough to call it first."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, are you ready to go?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sure, right back there."
Joey Tribbiani,I was thinking Chinese food.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but..."
Joey Tribbiani,She keeps punching me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely."
Joey Tribbiani,No-no.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, big!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Hiya!
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.
Joey Tribbiani,Uhh....
Joey Tribbiani,Nah.
Joey Tribbiani,What a bad idea!
Joey Tribbiani,She's right y'know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it."
Joey Tribbiani,That's not funny at all!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,What are you guys doing up?
Joey Tribbiani,Dark red.
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, you guys are so cute!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'll see you in the morning."
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed."
Joey Tribbiani,Cat.
Joey Tribbiani,I love you too.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him."
Joey Tribbiani,No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here."
Joey Tribbiani,What?! Why?!
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it involved Monica."
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out."
Joey Tribbiani,It-it doesn't?
Joey Tribbiani,That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Joey Tribbiani,In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Joey Tribbiani,Not really.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
Joey Tribbiani,Friends first? That's interesting.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, never done that either."
Joey Tribbiani,How you doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great..."
Joey Tribbiani,"...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So..."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Joey Tribbiani,I'll treat you real nice.
Joey Tribbiani,Won't-won't that take longer?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, I met this woman."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!"
Joey Tribbiani,Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, just a minute officer!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nope. Op, wait! There he goes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!"
Joey Tribbiani,This is your place?
Joey Tribbiani,"But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ugh!!
Joey Tribbiani,"I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit."
Joey Tribbiani,Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Joey Tribbiani,What happened?
Joey Tribbiani,You kissed him?!
Joey Tribbiani,"I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! No?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit!! Did you move?!
Joey Tribbiani,Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?"
Joey Tribbiani,Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway."
Joey Tribbiani,"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something."
Joey Tribbiani,"No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left."
Joey Tribbiani,I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Joey Tribbiani,Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, pick a card."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right now, memorize it. You got it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Is that your card?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Joey Tribbiani,Luck!
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Joey Tribbiani,Done.
Joey Tribbiani,They're gonna do it together.
Joey Tribbiani,"What, so I gotta shut it down now?"
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather."
Joey Tribbiani,What?! Are you kidding?!
Joey Tribbiani,All right!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad...."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"
Joey Tribbiani,I look more like him than you do!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah I did!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so..."
Joey Tribbiani,Who knows?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Pheebs! Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition."
Joey Tribbiani,That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Joey Tribbiani,"I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!"
Joey Tribbiani,What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Joey Tribbiani,At least I care about his feelings!
Joey Tribbiani,Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!"
Joey Tribbiani,You just give him a spoon baby!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?! So's yours!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, no problem."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross!
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, what did I say?"
Joey Tribbiani,How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hmm, noodle soup."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah right!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, ""Hmm, noodle soup."""
Joey Tribbiani,What you do mean?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor..."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you! So, did-did he get it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
Joey Tribbiani,"She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up."
Joey Tribbiani,True story!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, they cut me out of the show."
Joey Tribbiani,Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
Joey Tribbiani,I'm in it.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, all right. Ooh!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Is the show still on?

Joey Tribbiani,Dude! How come you took off?
Joey Tribbiani,Is something wrong?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich."
Joey Tribbiani,I know it doesn't make much sense...
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!"
Joey Tribbiani,No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!"
Joey Tribbiani,How good is that?
Joey Tribbiani,See?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, hero sandwiches."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what time is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell is that?!!
Joey Tribbiani,"That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}"
Joey Tribbiani,It's not a cat!
Joey Tribbiani,It's not a cat!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, the ball thing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-oh.
Joey Tribbiani,I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we haven't dropped it in..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
Joey Tribbiani,That's right baby.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, that's right!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
Joey Tribbiani,Did you get your money back?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey, here Pheebs."
Joey Tribbiani,Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhhh, mine too! Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Me too! Me too! Me too!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I got too excited!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, ""Where's Betsy?"" Right? And she says, ""Betsy's been dead for 10 years."""
Joey Tribbiani,"And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh umm, not go."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
Joey Tribbiani,Great! Problem solved!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, back to square one."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,Peanut butter!
Joey Tribbiani,A swimmer!
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,Ascot!
Joey Tribbiani,North route!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey man, what's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, what do you want to see?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,What do you like better action or comedy?
Joey Tribbiani,Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You ready to go?
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket."
Joey Tribbiani,"Did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""She's been dead for ten years."" I'm gonna be a millionaire!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,You got it!
Joey Tribbiani,Bye-bye!
Joey Tribbiani,Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Joey Tribbiani,See ya!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon."
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch."
Joey Tribbiani,You wanna eat? My treat!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?"
Joey Tribbiani,Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude you said, ""No!"""
Joey Tribbiani,You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Joey Tribbiani,I don't believe this!
Joey Tribbiani,What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Joey Tribbiani,"Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."
Joey Tribbiani,Not if you're gonna be like this!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Joey Tribbiani,Fine! Get out!
Joey Tribbiani,Get out!!
Joey Tribbiani,Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Joey Tribbiani,Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Joey Tribbiani,Wh-what?! Why?!

Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, hang out?! How long?"
Joey Tribbiani,No!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Monica, it's Joey!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Joey Tribbiani,"Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner."
Joey Tribbiani,That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?"
Joey Tribbiani,Don't come out here!
Joey Tribbiani,I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break."
Joey Tribbiani,"They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, what-what's going on?"
Joey Tribbiani,Dawson?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, there we go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, so close."
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right..."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Joey Tribbiani,Can I change a hundred?
Joey Tribbiani,Let's ride.
Joey Tribbiani,Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Joey Tribbiani,My identical hand twin!
Joey Tribbiani,"What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!"
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!"
Joey Tribbiani,"This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, are you unsupporting me again?"
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs!!
Joey Tribbiani,I found my identical hand twin!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Hey-hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Who's your friend? He's hot!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!"
Joey Tribbiani,My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?"
Joey Tribbiani,"He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay! How you doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,Right! Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!"
Joey Tribbiani,"It's me, Joey!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!"
Joey Tribbiani,But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, don't let her drink anymore!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhh!
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway..."
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh-ho-ho!
Joey Tribbiani,Hit me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
Joey Tribbiani,Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't need that anymore.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, here's where I win all my money back!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! What's up?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, ""Ross."" Do not say, ""Ross."""
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
Joey Tribbiani,"Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved."
Joey Tribbiani,They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Joey Tribbiani,An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,All right. All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Really? I don't...
Joey Tribbiani,I wanna rock and roll all night!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!"
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,That is incredible! You are the master!
Joey Tribbiani,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not finished.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Monica!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey man, you feeling any better?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! You're pregnant!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!"
Joey Tribbiani,"God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. ""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?"" ""Can't, its not there."""
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
Joey Tribbiani,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Really?! Well, when?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.
Joey Tribbiani,Great!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message."" Jeez!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it."
Joey Tribbiani,That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, ""Oh that's okay. You'll find someone."" And then, bamn! She finds you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier."
Joey Tribbiani,"Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Joey Tribbiani,Very good! Okay. G.
Joey Tribbiani,"Excellent! Okay umm, doggy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!"
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe she would say that too you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Any good mail?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda...."
Joey Tribbiani,Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Joey Tribbiani,Let me see that!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent."
Joey Tribbiani,...look both ways before you cross the street.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Estelle, listen..."
Joey Tribbiani,What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance."
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,Bastard!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious."
Joey Tribbiani,"No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!"
Joey Tribbiani,Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, now I'm scared."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but I don't wanna die!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. ""Hey, Timmy, I've got a surprise for you."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I'll just-hold on one second. ""Hey Timmy, I've got a surprise for you!"""
Joey Tribbiani,So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
Joey Tribbiani,Exactly.
Joey Tribbiani,"Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, okay."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower."
Joey Tribbiani,Hiya!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi Alex! And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants."
Joey Tribbiani,"""Take could care of your Momma son."" ""Take could care of your Momma son."" ""Come on son! Your Momma's good people!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"""Take good care of your Momma son."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey-hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?"
Joey Tribbiani,Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Joey Tribbiani,There's a lost and found? My shoe!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield."
Joey Tribbiani,Great! Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's not mine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's mine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?"
Joey Tribbiani,It's got 'em!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments."
Joey Tribbiani,"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she tops out at 130."
Joey Tribbiani,And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Joey Tribbiani,Sure!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, take it easy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but it's my wax."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot."
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so did I."
Joey Tribbiani,So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Joey Tribbiani,"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche."
Joey Tribbiani,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche."
Joey Tribbiani,Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
Joey Tribbiani,Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Joey Tribbiani,Porsche.
Joey Tribbiani,Hi! How are the Gellers?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! It's Porsche!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! How you doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?"
Joey Tribbiani,Right! And when is that due?
Joey Tribbiani,And that's every month?
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhh.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!!
Joey Tribbiani,No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
Joey Tribbiani,"No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on."
Joey Tribbiani,This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist."
Joey Tribbiani,I've got Ben.
Joey Tribbiani,Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, you're on."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
Joey Tribbiani,You serious?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, get ready to owe me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, here we go. Ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,"This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, not my game."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what's it called?"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know how to play Cups.
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,A two and a five.
Joey Tribbiani,Really?!
Joey Tribbiani,A four and a nine.
Joey Tribbiani,No. Why?
Joey Tribbiani,Damn! I am good at Cups!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what did you have?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, wow, 700."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!"
Joey Tribbiani,"The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's him, not it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she's gonna live with me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!"
Joey Tribbiani,From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Joey Tribbiani,You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey let me."
Joey Tribbiani,Of course I did.
Joey Tribbiani,"""When can you move in?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh God, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt."
Joey Tribbiani,You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Joey Tribbiani,I Gotcha!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhhh man
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too."
Joey Tribbiani,
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?"
Joey Tribbiani,"This is great, this is great, what else, what else?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, don't you mean ""for whom?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I do. How you doin?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!?!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh dear God!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, neighbor come on in."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, no, she's at dance class."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad."
Joey Tribbiani,It is???
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you're right. I'll talk to her."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm a man.
Joey Tribbiani,Hmm.
Joey Tribbiani,"Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly."
Joey Tribbiani,Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, well, it feels different."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?"
Joey Tribbiani,Well that's like summer in a bowl.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
Joey Tribbiani,"So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, I love birds."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby."
Joey Tribbiani,No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Joey Tribbiani,"It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be."
Joey Tribbiani,"Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to."
Joey Tribbiani,"And, uhh, maybe the watering can there."
Joey Tribbiani,And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Well maybe I love ya'.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ye-ye, we go to yours!"
Joey Tribbiani,"How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, this has been great!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, some of her friends, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!"
Joey Tribbiani,Y-sure!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Joey Tribbiani,Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Joey Tribbiani,Vomiting stories are funny...
Joey Tribbiani,Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Joey Tribbiani,Still not hot enough!
Joey Tribbiani,Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
Joey Tribbiani,Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh I am!
Joey Tribbiani,Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, they're not objects."
Joey Tribbiani,"Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying ""mmm"" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,I like it.
Joey Tribbiani,What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Joey Tribbiani,I wanna gooooooo!
Joey Tribbiani,"No it isn't, I ate that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nope, got it and I got yours too."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey you guys.
Joey Tribbiani,"I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like..."
Joey Tribbiani,I like her so much!
Joey Tribbiani,I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Joey Tribbiani,Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Joey Tribbiani,Did she just ask me out on a date?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'"
Joey Tribbiani,"OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,What do you mean?
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh.
Joey Tribbiani,No-no-no-no-no we came together!
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, take a hike wetpants!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny."
Joey Tribbiani,No! Year! Happy No Year!
Joey Tribbiani,"Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yoii. What was that for?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
Joey Tribbiani,But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"3, 2,"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Joey Tribbiani,I came over here to tell you guys.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?"
Joey Tribbiani,Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Joey Tribbiani,I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
Joey Tribbiani,I was tired!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I made that for her!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Joey Tribbiani,And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine."
Joey Tribbiani,Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
Joey Tribbiani,See ya tomorrow!
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,Blah?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem."
Joey Tribbiani,I guess.
Joey Tribbiani,"If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, she's uh-uh really sick."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!"
Joey Tribbiani,'Kay!
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, she really is sick!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise."
Joey Tribbiani,I can hear you!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"So uh, what are you guys doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!"
Joey Tribbiani,You don't think I know that!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well then, good night!"
Joey Tribbiani,"See? Eh, wasn't that fun?"
Joey Tribbiani,All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,How ya doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,"Pretty much, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, when it's not right, you know it."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,You're right! That did cheer me up!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys.
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Let's go watch it at your place.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know..."
Joey Tribbiani,"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book ."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure.
Joey Tribbiani,Not so much.
Joey Tribbiani,You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends."
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
Joey Tribbiani,I finished my book.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there."
Joey Tribbiani,You got it.
Joey Tribbiani,Just being friendly.
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction."
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird."
Joey Tribbiani,"See, now it's weird again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition."
Joey Tribbiani,"Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you'd hire me, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,That's great. Thanks Rach.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not answering that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!"
Joey Tribbiani,It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
Joey Tribbiani,How about a scone on the house baby?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Are you all finished here?
Joey Tribbiani,Great!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,That'll be $3.85.
Joey Tribbiani,"It's just I can't because my manager said I... ""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie..."
Joey Tribbiani,"""...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, not it here it isn't."
Joey Tribbiani,"""Happy birthday to you!"""
Joey Tribbiani,What? No-no it's her birthday!
Joey Tribbiani,But it really...
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-ho, and mine!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!"
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah you got 5 years left!
Joey Tribbiani,You wanna make it 6?!
Joey Tribbiani,You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."""

Joey Tribbiani,"So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!"
Joey Tribbiani,Movies?
Joey Tribbiani,I don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like."
Joey Tribbiani,Sort of...
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe's a porn star!
Joey Tribbiani,Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right well, I'd better take that back."
Joey Tribbiani,We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
Joey Tribbiani,"No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.

Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, not you too!"
Joey Tribbiani,Nice!
Joey Tribbiani,"That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?"
Joey Tribbiani,You do?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,What is the matter with you?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?"
Joey Tribbiani,I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!"
Joey Tribbiani,"So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh dear God, let me think."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?"
Joey Tribbiani,That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, here-here!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it's always nice to meet the fans."
Joey Tribbiani,She's not crazy is she?
Joey Tribbiani,"So uh, how you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey there you are!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, you watch too much TV."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that."
Joey Tribbiani,"I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it."
Joey Tribbiani,Iced tea.
Joey Tribbiani,Did I not just tell him?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Joey Tribbiani,Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
Joey Tribbiani,"I know. Yeah, his name is Pat."
Joey Tribbiani,"Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's uh, right through there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah you did.
Joey Tribbiani,Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Joey Tribbiani,When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Joey Tribbiani,"Come, come here."
Joey Tribbiani,Morning!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No! No, not after seeing that."
Joey Tribbiani,Wh-why?
Joey Tribbiani,"That's ridiculous! I'm not a ""Star,"" just a regular famous actor."
Joey Tribbiani,"Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! Uh okay, well uh..."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, do you want the ring or not?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,All right!
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I...."
Joey Tribbiani,You?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! So, was it amazing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Just okay-Did you do it right?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?"
Joey Tribbiani,"But you got to be with both of them, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Not the other one?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you don't want that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,You got a little bored?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah? What did ya have?
Joey Tribbiani,Sounds good.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?"
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Uhh do it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, where was I?"
Joey Tribbiani,Takes it out of you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?"
Joey Tribbiani,"And of course, crotchless panties."
Joey Tribbiani,"You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?"
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
Joey Tribbiani,"But it's $2,000."
Joey Tribbiani,Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
Joey Tribbiani,"2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?"
Joey Tribbiani,No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up."
Joey Tribbiani,Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?"
Joey Tribbiani,That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit Carl!
Joey Tribbiani,That's us.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, $2,000."
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit Carl!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90..."
Joey Tribbiani,"No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, how bad is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, is that..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey-hey listen...
Joey Tribbiani,"When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ah-ha!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey."
Joey Tribbiani,This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
Joey Tribbiani,I know!
Joey Tribbiani,This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?"
Joey Tribbiani,You couldn't do it?!
Joey Tribbiani,Ah whatever!
Joey Tribbiani,No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Joey Tribbiani,Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Look!
Joey Tribbiani,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, here you go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,So?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs- Oh!"
Joey Tribbiani,Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha! Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Joey Tribbiani,Great! Roomie!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred."
Joey Tribbiani,Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! So close.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?"
Joey Tribbiani,Huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?"
Joey Tribbiani,No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
Joey Tribbiani,"So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple."
Joey Tribbiani,"And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid."
Joey Tribbiani,Give me $400!
Joey Tribbiani,"Or! You can just, y'know..."
Joey Tribbiani,What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!"
Joey Tribbiani,You pushed him!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?"
Joey Tribbiani,I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?!
Joey Tribbiani,Call it even?
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
Joey Tribbiani,"So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, to be 13 again."
Joey Tribbiani,"The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!"
Joey Tribbiani,No! I won't leave you!
Joey Tribbiani,No you're not! Not to me!
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or ""Mac."" Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or ""C.H.E.E.S.E."""
Joey Tribbiani,That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen."
Joey Tribbiani,I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
Joey Tribbiani,You really think so?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this."
Joey Tribbiani,"There's my scene, there's my scene. ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear."
Joey Tribbiani,"I Play Al Pacino's Butt. All Right? He Goes Into The Shower, And Then- I'M His Butt."
Joey Tribbiani,"C'Mon, You Guys. This Is A Real Movie, And Al Pacino's In It, And That's Big!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, Okay, Fine! Make Jokes, I Don'T Care! This Is A Big Break For Me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right well, I'm outta here. Wish me luck."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, whatever."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, did I fool ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it went amazingly well!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys."
Joey Tribbiani,"And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers..."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Joey Tribbiani,"There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand."
Joey Tribbiani,"I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!"
Joey Tribbiani,The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Joey Tribbiani,How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!"
Joey Tribbiani,And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!! That's even worse!!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! But it's the same!
Joey Tribbiani,"Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
Joey Tribbiani,Name one!
Joey Tribbiani,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?"
Joey Tribbiani,I said name one!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
Joey Tribbiani,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,What message?
Joey Tribbiani,What?! It's 6 o'clock!
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe this Chandler!
Joey Tribbiani,Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, well I'm uh..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad."
Joey Tribbiani,That's mean! You really had me going there!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you're right. Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be!"
Joey Tribbiani,You hug me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, do we do this too much?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU."
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, you don't have to yell."
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys!
Joey Tribbiani,Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Joey Tribbiani,"But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
Joey Tribbiani,"How do you do there, Wayne?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?"
Joey Tribbiani,"This is like the temporary robot, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Joey Tribbiani,"Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani."
Joey Tribbiani,Wow!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,Why should I help you?!
Joey Tribbiani,What do you need?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,What are you in love with her or something?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E."
Joey Tribbiani,"You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Joey Tribbiani,Me too.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Joey Tribbiani,"I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! So I'm back.
Joey Tribbiani,"Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, it's not on TV yet."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, let's get me back up there!"
Joey Tribbiani,What-But you saw the show!
Joey Tribbiani,Dry cleaners?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh you should, it's great."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?"
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!

Joey Tribbiani,I won! That was my guess!
Joey Tribbiani,"I guessed 20,000!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What?! I don't have 20,000!"
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't know it was an auction!
Joey Tribbiani,"I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! Charity?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money."
Joey Tribbiani,"So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, yes."
Joey Tribbiani,You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!

Joey Tribbiani,"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you know Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you changed?
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe that's the problem.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!"
Joey Tribbiani,There are?
Joey Tribbiani,R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler loves marriage!!
Joey Tribbiani,You got that from what I said?!
Joey Tribbiani,Where the hell have you been?!
Joey Tribbiani,Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!"
Joey Tribbiani,I know! They suck!!
Joey Tribbiani,I know!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!

Joey Tribbiani,Dude-dude-dude!
Joey Tribbiani,"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat."

Joey Tribbiani,"This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay that's fair.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Dude!
Joey Tribbiani,She's gone.
Joey Tribbiani,She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
Joey Tribbiani,"She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think."
Joey Tribbiani,"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me."
Joey Tribbiani,To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
Joey Tribbiani,I am so sorry man.
Joey Tribbiani,Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah I'll take that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over."
Joey Tribbiani,"But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?"
Joey Tribbiani,You guys don't think I look 19?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?"
Joey Tribbiani,I was afraid of that.
Joey Tribbiani,'Sup? 'Sup dude?
Joey Tribbiani,"So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on man, really how old?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow thanks!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"When? Today? Some, not a lot."
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry about that man, that happens."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Once.
Joey Tribbiani,I did it anyway.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,"You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Seriously?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm 30!
Joey Tribbiani,Aww crap!
Joey Tribbiani,"Psss, that is whack!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, ""You look 19,"" and then they just take it away like-like, ""No you don't."""
Joey Tribbiani,Wouldn't she?
Joey Tribbiani,Would she? You ate my candy bar!
Joey Tribbiani,"They break your heart, don't they?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
Joey Tribbiani,What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
Joey Tribbiani,And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Who wants French toast?
Joey Tribbiani,"Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, the duck..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'm gonna go!"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey Tribbiani,Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Joey Tribbiani,"Where do you think, Zelda?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah I did!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!"
Joey Tribbiani,You got porn!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Rach.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
Joey Tribbiani,Gotcha.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello, Zelda."
Joey Tribbiani,The vicar!
Joey Tribbiani,"Like a goalie, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn."
Joey Tribbiani,Huh?
Joey Tribbiani,I-I-I-I did?
Joey Tribbiani,This body?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't want to, I'm scared."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!"
Joey Tribbiani,Feminine.
Joey Tribbiani,Ahoy!
Joey Tribbiani,Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Joey Tribbiani,Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips."
Joey Tribbiani,You could?
Joey Tribbiani,Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Joey Tribbiani,What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, boat rope."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, rub it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh..."
Joey Tribbiani,And deaf!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie."
Joey Tribbiani,Women are mean!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!"
Joey Tribbiani,Because! You're mean on the boat!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?"""
Joey Tribbiani,Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Joey Tribbiani,Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Joey Tribbiani,You won't boss me around anymore?
Joey Tribbiani,And you'll be nice?
Joey Tribbiani,And you'll be topless?
Joey Tribbiani,Do you want me to learn?!
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Nope.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know why you just don't say left.
Joey Tribbiani,Huh?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?!
Joey Tribbiani,Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, hey I did learn."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Come on.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right."
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?"
Joey Tribbiani,Just pull on it.
Joey Tribbiani,What else?
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
Joey Tribbiani,Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
Joey Tribbiani,"So, what did you guys think?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Mom, so what did you think?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good."
Joey Tribbiani,You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you weren't finished?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, it's really long."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, these really are the days of our lives."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!"
Joey Tribbiani,Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Terry!
Joey Tribbiani,"It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to."
Joey Tribbiani,So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Was she happy you gave her the job?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!"
Joey Tribbiani,Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Joey Tribbiani,"How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there."
Joey Tribbiani,Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Joey Tribbiani,Because they wanted me to audition!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Terry.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?"
Joey Tribbiani,Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I guess this will be fine."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing, why?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude."
Joey Tribbiani,Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, okay."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down..."
Joey Tribbiani,I had a donut.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! That guy's all right!
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, Monica told me."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know Rach.
Joey Tribbiani,One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, for you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we look great together."
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, we don't have to imagine."
Joey Tribbiani,We'll just see.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?"
Joey Tribbiani,Die Hard 2.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!"
Joey Tribbiani,And?
Joey Tribbiani,Die Hard!!!!!!
Joey Tribbiani,What are you talking about? Bitch.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I don't know!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later."
Joey Tribbiani,No! Never! Never! Bye.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations."
Joey Tribbiani,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay! When?!
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh!
Joey Tribbiani,I want to do it again.
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Joey Tribbiani,Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest."
Joey Tribbiani,Why is 10 the highest?
Joey Tribbiani,I don't want to marry Chandler!
Joey Tribbiani,I've got cold feet.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, Phoebe..."
Joey Tribbiani,"We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! That's nice.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow. Good speech.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,And she's back in the game.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Joey Tribbiani,"No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be."
Joey Tribbiani,Great nap.
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
Joey Tribbiani,Morning!
Joey Tribbiani,Pretty good.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great."
Joey Tribbiani,"Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! What's up?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Erin! Still here!
Joey Tribbiani,Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, good to see you again."
Joey Tribbiani,Bye-bye.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, system kinda broke down huh?!"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!!
Joey Tribbiani,No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, do you know what guys want!"
Joey Tribbiani,"My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so we should go catch our movie."
Joey Tribbiani,I like to see the previews. The candy.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Erin.
Joey Tribbiani,What party?
Joey Tribbiani,Who's birthday party?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, and how is Allison?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, look how that worked out."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a..."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Joey Tribbiani,What about Game 1 of the Series?
Joey Tribbiani,You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You wanna go?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. See you guys later.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, thank you so much."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
Joey Tribbiani,Where are you gettin' this?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Finally!
Joey Tribbiani,Shhhh!
Joey Tribbiani,Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Joey Tribbiani,Fifty-six!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Joey Tribbiani,"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have."
Joey Tribbiani,"But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States."
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell is in there?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah that dog left!
Joey Tribbiani,Don't do it!
Joey Tribbiani,Told ya.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream."
Joey Tribbiani,Half hour.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo."
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?"
Joey Tribbiani,"So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero."
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, you need some help?"
Joey Tribbiani,"First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Joey Tribbiani,"If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Joey Tribbiani,You think?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it."
Joey Tribbiani,Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Joey Tribbiani,Those two only had each other!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Pheebs?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Rach?
Joey Tribbiani,That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
Joey Tribbiani,"Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Joey Tribbiani,What's up buddy?
Joey Tribbiani,Waiting for candy.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Great, you're home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!"
Joey Tribbiani,No! Drums!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. Ready? One, two, three, four..."
Joey Tribbiani,Tequila!!
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you. Hey Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Joey Tribbiani,What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!"
Joey Tribbiani,Merry Christmas!
Joey Tribbiani,Is it back in the cage?
Joey Tribbiani,Cage closed?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'll see you at 8:00.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!"
Joey Tribbiani,The Ross-Is that back?!!
Joey Tribbiani,Awww! Mel Torme died.
Joey Tribbiani,Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,What do you got there?
Joey Tribbiani,Huh? Uh...
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?! Tonight?!
Joey Tribbiani,After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You were right before. I mean, friends are so important."
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know-y'know what I really want?
Joey Tribbiani,"Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Joey Tribbiani,What's the rush? What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, what is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, she graduated from high school!"
Joey Tribbiani,Fine!
Joey Tribbiani,Fine!
Joey Tribbiani,"What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, y'know you could always visit him."
Joey Tribbiani,Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Joey Tribbiani,I can give it a shot.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, what are we havin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what else makes you wonder?
Joey Tribbiani,Check out the rack on this chick!
Joey Tribbiani,Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Joey Tribbiani,Ross!
Joey Tribbiani,"Come here, check this out!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, there's two women dude."
Joey Tribbiani,Right-right up here.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know! Yeah, I do."
Joey Tribbiani,What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh no! No! No!
Joey Tribbiani,Come on!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Joey Tribbiani,What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?"
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well all right so, it looks like we're even!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah? Really? No one's home?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Just hurry up!
Joey Tribbiani,I think face to face.
Joey Tribbiani,"Face to face, yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, just shimmy down me and drop!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Joey Tribbiani,It's not that far! Just drop!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,Why would you want to do that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, there is a decent place to..."
Joey Tribbiani,No. No. No.
Joey Tribbiani,No. Rosita does not move.
Joey Tribbiani,As in Rosita does not move.
Joey Tribbiani,The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Joey Tribbiani,Is there a problem?
Joey Tribbiani,"I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?"
Joey Tribbiani,She's not even cold yet!
Joey Tribbiani,That's true.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this."
Joey Tribbiani,No I won't.
Joey Tribbiani,"Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know why you say that so soon.
Joey Tribbiani,Francette? What is she? A couch?
Joey Tribbiani,Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No it's not weird, it's a miracle!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!"
Joey Tribbiani,Can you tell me how this happened?
Joey Tribbiani,Miracle!
Joey Tribbiani,Someone like an...angel?
Joey Tribbiani,Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, me too."
Joey Tribbiani,Fine.
Joey Tribbiani,No. Really?
Joey Tribbiani,My chair heels itself.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!"
Joey Tribbiani,Your chair?!
Joey Tribbiani,"So, there was no miracle?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Joey Tribbiani,How do you figure?
Joey Tribbiani,That's right!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! We are!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhh...... Eh?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,They do!
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal."
Joey Tribbiani,Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
Joey Tribbiani,And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
Joey Tribbiani,Well actually...
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, you soooo need this car."
Joey Tribbiani,Yep.
Joey Tribbiani,"Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?"
Joey Tribbiani,Will you quit hoggin' it!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay."
Joey Tribbiani,That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
Joey Tribbiani,Like what?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home."
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't like this anymore.
Joey Tribbiani,Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
Joey Tribbiani,All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
Joey Tribbiani,Nice.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!"
Joey Tribbiani,That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
Joey Tribbiani,Say what?
Joey Tribbiani,"No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!"
Joey Tribbiani,"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me..."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, one of the writers."
Joey Tribbiani,Umm...
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
Joey Tribbiani,So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
Joey Tribbiani,See you in 2003.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show."
Joey Tribbiani,No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Joey Tribbiani,Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? ""Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay! All right!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!"
Joey Tribbiani,Like-like what?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, ""Boy, she-she is a great actress!"" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, ""She is hot!"""
Joey Tribbiani,You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"That uh, that is my roommate Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure. Yep.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, bye-bye."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, here we go."
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh noo...
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks!
Joey Tribbiani,Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Joey Tribbiani,The airport?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?"
Joey Tribbiani,That's a really long time.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!"
Joey Tribbiani,Good luck.
Joey Tribbiani,I call it!!
Joey Tribbiani,Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Joey Tribbiani,"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
Joey Tribbiani,Well then let me do it!
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me."
Joey Tribbiani,So I can do it?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."" Eh? ""It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."" ""We too can share and love and have and receive."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,"""When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..."" And then I can't think of a good word for right here."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, ""Began their beautiful journey..."""
Joey Tribbiani,"""...by doin' it."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!! I call that London style.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah baby!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah baby!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, dude I'm so sorry!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ah.
Joey Tribbiani,For just you?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah baby! No baby!
Joey Tribbiani,And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!"
Joey Tribbiani,This is crazy.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Really? I can do it?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,So are guys doing okay?
Joey Tribbiani,What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!"
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,Here you go.
Joey Tribbiani,Good for you!
Joey Tribbiani,Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Joey Tribbiani,"This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, I added three."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah...
Joey Tribbiani,"Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, can I give you a hand?"
Joey Tribbiani,Boyfriend?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?"
Joey Tribbiani,Got it! So...
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Chandler!
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Two days ago.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it."
Joey Tribbiani,Kristen Lang.
Joey Tribbiani,"Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah well we should order some food then.
Joey Tribbiani,That sounds fair.
Joey Tribbiani,Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers."
Joey Tribbiani,You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
Joey Tribbiani,Well we'll see!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
Joey Tribbiani,Kristen?
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
Joey Tribbiani,A woman in a man's body.
Joey Tribbiani,"So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?"
Joey Tribbiani,So you've just married the one time then?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?"
Joey Tribbiani,No. No.
Joey Tribbiani,No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Joey Tribbiani,Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Joey Tribbiani,Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Joey Tribbiani,Monkey lover!
Joey Tribbiani,When do you think we lost her?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Joey Tribbiani,No-no.
Joey Tribbiani,No! I'm up for a Soapie!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards."
Joey Tribbiani,Many are scheduled to appear.
Joey Tribbiani,"And the winner is...Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,What award are you practicing for?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,You practice losing the Grammies too?
Joey Tribbiani,Ah.
Joey Tribbiani,Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa!
Joey Tribbiani,Ross has a boyfriend.
Joey Tribbiani,How'd you get over that teacher?
Joey Tribbiani,Problem solved.
Joey Tribbiani,This is it! This is my category.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I got my speech!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Joey Tribbiani,'Kay!
Joey Tribbiani,What the?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, ""I behalfin' it!"""
Joey Tribbiani,But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Joey Tribbiani,Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
Joey Tribbiani,"No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it."
Joey Tribbiani,I can scratch that right off.
Joey Tribbiani,All right!
Joey Tribbiani,I'll take it back tomorrow.
Joey Tribbiani,If I can't have it you can't have it!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Jessica.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, this is my friend Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?"
Joey Tribbiani,Take it back?
Joey Tribbiani,Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, do I know you?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!"
Joey Tribbiani,They loved me!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back."
Joey Tribbiani,They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Joey Tribbiani,I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story."
Joey Tribbiani,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
Joey Tribbiani,Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'm back!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!"
Joey Tribbiani,And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! Sure! That's great!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold."
Joey Tribbiani,So...What?
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,No. What?
Joey Tribbiani,Barmifsaed?
Joey Tribbiani,Nope.
Joey Tribbiani,Yep.
Joey Tribbiani,That's right.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later."
Joey Tribbiani,I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Joey Tribbiani,I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Joey Tribbiani,Unless what?
Joey Tribbiani,Like what?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! This looks great!
Joey Tribbiani,And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Joey Tribbiani,Thank God!
Joey Tribbiani,Ah.
Joey Tribbiani,Well maybe we just take that one away.
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird."
Joey Tribbiani,Ow!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,The fruit roll up.
Joey Tribbiani,Delicious.
Joey Tribbiani,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Joey Tribbiani,The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
Joey Tribbiani,"And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,My whole family's from Naples!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before."
Joey Tribbiani,Probably Monica and Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
Joey Tribbiani,Who you what? Who you what?!
Joey Tribbiani,Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hello!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Rach.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!"
Joey Tribbiani,You got me. I don't...
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!"
Joey Tribbiani,Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
Joey Tribbiani,We should really learn how to play the real way.
Joey Tribbiani,Nice move.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux."
Joey Tribbiani,"Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani,Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. It happened!
Joey Tribbiani,Why are you taking this away from me?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-ho, you should get inside my head."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they're not coming."
Joey Tribbiani,Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Mon, if you could just call my mom..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years."
Joey Tribbiani,Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, ""Monica..."
Joey Tribbiani,"""...when I look back over our time together..."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together."
Joey Tribbiani,Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"How is ""Monica, I love your sweet ass,"" inappropriate?"
Joey Tribbiani,Has it been that long?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
Joey Tribbiani,You?! And-and you?!
Joey Tribbiani,How?! When?!
Joey Tribbiani,IN LONDON!!!
Joey Tribbiani,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!"
Joey Tribbiani,Well I didn't tell them!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
Joey Tribbiani,And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,They know you know.
Joey Tribbiani,I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh!
Joey Tribbiani,"I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!"
Joey Tribbiani,It's not my first time.
Joey Tribbiani,So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Funny one! That's good!
Joey Tribbiani,What? I don't get it.
Joey Tribbiani,I have never known love like this.
Joey Tribbiani,If he goes first he can!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you got a couple hours?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better."
Joey Tribbiani,"So uh, what's your name?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?"
Joey Tribbiani,Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Joey Tribbiani,Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!"
Joey Tribbiani,That's weird!
Joey Tribbiani,That's...kinda hot.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Joey Tribbiani,You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about."
Joey Tribbiani,The silk? Feels really good!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
Joey Tribbiani,"Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?"
Joey Tribbiani,Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Hm-mmm.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, let me get this. These are for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
Joey Tribbiani,No!
Joey Tribbiani,No!
Joey Tribbiani,Nooo!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, I'll be done by then."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Me too.

Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Joey Tribbiani,"No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Where have you been?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.

Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?"
Joey Tribbiani,Great! All right. I'll see you later.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!

Joey Tribbiani,No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
Joey Tribbiani,"Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm having surgery!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today."
Joey Tribbiani,Transplant.
Joey Tribbiani,Hair transplant.
Joey Tribbiani,It's not on my head.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!"
Joey Tribbiani,Are you drunk?
Joey Tribbiani,Yes you are!
Joey Tribbiani,I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Joey Tribbiani,What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?"
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you. Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm still on the set!
Joey Tribbiani,"I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this."
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Joey Tribbiani,Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
Joey Tribbiani,"So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
Joey Tribbiani,"So I got your car, it's right outside."
Joey Tribbiani,That's what you told me.
Joey Tribbiani,No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,"You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah you do!
Joey Tribbiani,Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
Joey Tribbiani,"We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again."
Joey Tribbiani,What? What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Joey Tribbiani,Ah. Slow swimmers?
Joey Tribbiani,I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, eleven, eleven and a half."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Joey Tribbiani,No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, ""Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!"" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!"
Joey Tribbiani,"So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I'm not proud of this, but..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Shh. Shh. Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing! It was something.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?"
Joey Tribbiani,Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
Joey Tribbiani,David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say."
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God.
Joey Tribbiani,Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but..."
Joey Tribbiani,The guy left this.
Joey Tribbiani,You opened them all?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Joey Tribbiani,"I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this."
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, give me the ring back!"
Joey Tribbiani,I understand.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered..."
Joey Tribbiani,There you go!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,We know its Ross!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well that, that sounds good."
Joey Tribbiani,Bye.
Joey Tribbiani,What secrets?
Joey Tribbiani,You'll tell me later?
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you."
Joey Tribbiani,Why would they take away our keys?
Joey Tribbiani,No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I washed those!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah that didn't sound like me.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I have stuff in there too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it seemed pretty important."
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I don't think that's what it is."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh wow, I don't feel well."
Joey Tribbiani,"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell is that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. So then I can heat this up?
Joey Tribbiani,So it's noticeable huh?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
Joey Tribbiani,How are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what did you say to her?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys."
Joey Tribbiani,How? I guess I could break down your door.
Joey Tribbiani,And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't see the baby. Where is it?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You're back!
Joey Tribbiani,"A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people?"
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
Joey Tribbiani,Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
Joey Tribbiani,You're welcome buddy.
Joey Tribbiani,Whom. That's right.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place."
Joey Tribbiani,All right! I'll have a sandwich!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh I think we do.
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe."
Joey Tribbiani,Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, for like months?"
Joey Tribbiani,Six months? Whoa that's rough.
Joey Tribbiani,The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe..."
Joey Tribbiani,Have a nice six more months Ross!
Joey Tribbiani,"I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying..."
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it."
Joey Tribbiani,How long since you've seen a girl naked?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not feeling it.
Joey Tribbiani,No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right now... All right, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Good luck.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,That means a lot to me man.
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
Joey Tribbiani,You're right.
Joey Tribbiani,Loud and clear!
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake."
Joey Tribbiani,Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm so happy!
Joey Tribbiani,How do you know about that story?!
Joey Tribbiani,Some guy!!
Joey Tribbiani,Ken Adams!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, couldn't care less."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey you too!
Joey Tribbiani,What? You weren't in it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?"
Joey Tribbiani,"This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,Here we go! Here we go!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him."
Joey Tribbiani,I said no.
Joey Tribbiani,What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
Joey Tribbiani,It's no Ukrainian film.
Joey Tribbiani,I set her up with this actor on my show.
Joey Tribbiani,No
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
Joey Tribbiani,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash."
Joey Tribbiani,So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!"
Joey Tribbiani,And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! What is going on?!
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,What do you mean?
Joey Tribbiani,That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, but I don't think that's what she wants."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I said fun!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up."
Joey Tribbiani,"No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not..."
Joey Tribbiani,That hot girl from their wedding?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. I'm Chandler
Joey Tribbiani,When have I ever done that?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey all right, Ross came as doody."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Exclusively.
Joey Tribbiani,"Catwoman, hands down."
Joey Tribbiani,"But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe."
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not sure.
Joey Tribbiani,Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
Joey Tribbiani,"I would say, ""Woman, please!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Here comes the temper.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, here's a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,So Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question."
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,So you think Ross too?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing."
Joey Tribbiani,Rach?
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!"
Joey Tribbiani,Or equally weak.
Joey Tribbiani,You're a weird lady.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,That's not so bad.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, well finish your coffee; let's go."
Joey Tribbiani,"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you're switching apartments?"
Joey Tribbiani,But Rachel has an apartment.
Joey Tribbiani,She is?
Joey Tribbiani,I guess I didn't really think about it.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place."
Joey Tribbiani,I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
Joey Tribbiani,"No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?"
Joey Tribbiani,I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
Joey Tribbiani,I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know I blame Ross for this.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm loud!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm up all night!
Joey Tribbiani,Hello!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohh!
Joey Tribbiani,I know! I found it on the street.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,Ew.
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,Isn't that great?
Joey Tribbiani,It's a grand tradition!
Joey Tribbiani,"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night."
Joey Tribbiani,"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hot?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Joey Tribbiani,Will you let the lady talk?!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby...
Joey Tribbiani,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun."
Joey Tribbiani,How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
Joey Tribbiani,"That's her! Okay, come on!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, that-that's-that's me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan."
Joey Tribbiani,Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that's one naked hooker!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do."
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny."
Joey Tribbiani,I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?"
Joey Tribbiani,In a minute!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! It's your bachelor party.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't want to. You do it!
Joey Tribbiani,You do it!
Joey Tribbiani,I miss this.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I-I miss hanging out with you."
Joey Tribbiani,Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?"
Joey Tribbiani,You got it. Come here.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back."
Joey Tribbiani,You fall for it every time!
Joey Tribbiani,I just want you to say it once in a while.
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe!
Joey Tribbiani,No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
Joey Tribbiani,She is?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
Joey Tribbiani,"But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!"
Joey Tribbiani,No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!"
Joey Tribbiani,Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full."
Joey Tribbiani,Who the hell is this guy?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh hey!
Joey Tribbiani,That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. How-how big is that?
Joey Tribbiani,It's like me when I was born.
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, who is this guy?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Joey Tribbiani,You are my Everest.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just...I just-I gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give."
Joey Tribbiani,All right where's that turkey!
Joey Tribbiani,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Joey Tribbiani,Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
Joey Tribbiani,"No just, nobody press on my stomach."
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, just cut me a little sliver. A little bigger. Little bigger. What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren..."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, so will you meet with her?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?"
Joey Tribbiani,She took 'em!
Joey Tribbiani,Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Joey Tribbiani,My little sister Dina!
Joey Tribbiani,"This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?"
Joey Tribbiani,Is that a sandwich?!
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
Joey Tribbiani,Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
Joey Tribbiani,"You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!"
Joey Tribbiani,I can't look at you right now!
Joey Tribbiani,"Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man..."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh you'll take 'em!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You don't get a say in this!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we're halfway there! Okay! You!"
Joey Tribbiani,Well what am I supposed to do?
Joey Tribbiani,No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?"
Joey Tribbiani,You were right. He is funny.
Joey Tribbiani,"Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!"
Joey Tribbiani,So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
Joey Tribbiani,No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
Joey Tribbiani,"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!"
Joey Tribbiani,Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I'd be scared of them, but all right."
Joey Tribbiani,Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Joey Tribbiani,That's right! By his uncle too!
Joey Tribbiani,Come here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm missin' picture time?!
Joey Tribbiani,Congratulations! You just got married!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!"
Joey Tribbiani,Who was that?
Joey Tribbiani,You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, what's wrong?"
Joey Tribbiani,Then why did I ask?
Joey Tribbiani,Is that college talk for horny?
Joey Tribbiani,"Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too."
Joey Tribbiani,Good night.
Joey Tribbiani,I can't do it!
Joey Tribbiani,You're Rachel!
Joey Tribbiani,You're my friend!
Joey Tribbiani,"But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad."
Joey Tribbiani,I know!
Joey Tribbiani,Do you wanna do it?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, me neither! I was just testing you!"
Joey Tribbiani,This conversation never happened!
Joey Tribbiani,Good night!
Joey Tribbiani,Get back in there!
Joey Tribbiani,Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm..."
Joey Tribbiani,"I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, great! Thanks!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, y'know what?"
Joey Tribbiani,Why don't I take you out?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out..."
Joey Tribbiani,I'll be fun.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman."
Joey Tribbiani,I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date."
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for- I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well it does when you combine it with, ""This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot."
Joey Tribbiani,Queens.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!"
Joey Tribbiani,"""Where'd you grow up,"" it's so simple!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes I am! Again so simple!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!"
Joey Tribbiani,I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Joey Tribbiani,"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much."
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. Huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible."
Joey Tribbiani,"Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go."
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya..."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Yeah. Me to.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh right!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah me too, all night."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper."
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh."
Joey Tribbiani,Alone?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, it didn't work out."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, okay. Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sure, yeah, why not?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay."
Joey Tribbiani,Terrified.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, neither."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?"
Joey Tribbiani,"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Well, what's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Whaaat?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God. You do?
Joey Tribbiani,"I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes."
Joey Tribbiani,I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
Joey Tribbiani,"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!"
Joey Tribbiani,You think?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings."
Joey Tribbiani,Not really.
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,What are you guys doing in here?
Joey Tribbiani,"It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, ""it was cuckoo!"" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush."
Joey Tribbiani,I love you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I love you too."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!"
Joey Tribbiani,What? What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,Aaaah...
Joey Tribbiani,Really?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you...you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my, oh my God!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mia Hamm?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh that's amazing.
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
Joey Tribbiani,A dreamless sleep.
Joey Tribbiani,Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing."
Joey Tribbiani,"Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! So?
Joey Tribbiani,So but everything is normal.
Joey Tribbiani,And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
Joey Tribbiani,Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
Joey Tribbiani,Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
Joey Tribbiani,You sure?!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh hey-hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, what's with the candy?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?"
Joey Tribbiani,Then why do you throw like one?
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure. ""Monica."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I just...I feel terrible."
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm on it!
Joey Tribbiani,Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation."
Joey Tribbiani,"The thing is...'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross...Ross is missing everything. So..."
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you two should live together.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that...if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right now, so? What do you think?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I was due."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick."
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Bye.
Joey Tribbiani,There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. But maybe later.
Joey Tribbiani,You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, okay."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun."
Joey Tribbiani,"Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!"
Joey Tribbiani,Did I just throw this?
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella."
Joey Tribbiani,"C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be."
Joey Tribbiani,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!"
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
Joey Tribbiani,Rachel stuff.
Joey Tribbiani,He's breathing!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day."
Joey Tribbiani,Sort of.
Joey Tribbiani,You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I...I d-"
Joey Tribbiani,Forget about it. It's no big deal.
Joey Tribbiani,It's nothing.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen."
Joey Tribbiani,No!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends."
Joey Tribbiani,No. I don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's the best."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I don't know."
Joey Tribbiani,"I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,It's Rachel.
Joey Tribbiani,"There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's the best."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I don't know."
Joey Tribbiani,"I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-"
Joey Tribbiani,It's Rachel.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,Yes. I like Rachel.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but it's not a big deal."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh what then? Kick me?
Joey Tribbiani,Bite me?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Joey Tribbiani,"Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I thought you knew that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, ""Ah, I'll get over this."" Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
Joey Tribbiani,But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...
Joey Tribbiani,Are you sure?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident."
Joey Tribbiani,"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something."
Joey Tribbiani,Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Sure.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh... How long have we known each other?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-huh, long time."
Joey Tribbiani,But over the past few weeks...
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually uh, could you give us a second?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not quite sure.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm falling in love with you.
Joey Tribbiani,Does it really matter?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!"
Joey Tribbiani,But.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sure!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh God! That's Rachel!
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's...too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole."
Joey Tribbiani,I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right so, so what do I do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"So you uh, have a...big work problem?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Huh. Okay. So uh, I think I'm gonna take off."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,What he wants to buy your baby?!
Joey Tribbiani,That's crazy!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, how did this even happen?"
Joey Tribbiani,Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Joey Tribbiani,Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore."
Joey Tribbiani,Let's just say I took care of it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, ""You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"""
Joey Tribbiani,What?! Why?!
Joey Tribbiani,And you couldn't think of anything else?!
Joey Tribbiani,You lied to me!
Joey Tribbiani,So? What-what-what happened?
Joey Tribbiani,I know. I know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit."
Joey Tribbiani,Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
Joey Tribbiani,"So, who's the guy?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them."
Joey Tribbiani,And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Joey Tribbiani,"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing."
Joey Tribbiani,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him."
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,What-what?
Joey Tribbiani,"I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge."
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing...
Joey Tribbiani,"Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah you are baby.
Joey Tribbiani,"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no."
Joey Tribbiani,"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, not at all. Happy to do it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food."
Joey Tribbiani,And I'll have all the muffins.
Joey Tribbiani,"All you want is a dingle/What you envy's a schwang/A thing through which you can tinkle/Or play with, or simply let hang..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I guess it is. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne... baby...I'm gonna want to meet her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do...so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad for the paper tray."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, there are so many things, it's hard to pick just one."
Joey Tribbiani,Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
Joey Tribbiani,What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!"
Joey Tribbiani,I think you're right.
Joey Tribbiani,One.
Joey Tribbiani,That's kinda nice.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!!
Joey Tribbiani,"In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I'm also a mento for the kids. Y'know a mento, a role model."
Joey Tribbiani,Right.
Joey Tribbiani,"Matter of fact, I do."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious."
Joey Tribbiani,"No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!"
Joey Tribbiani,I like it.
Joey Tribbiani,What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
Joey Tribbiani,"The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?"
Joey Tribbiani,Not anymore.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, what are we havin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, I don't believe in these crazy diets y'know, just everything in moderation."
Joey Tribbiani,I'll take those to go. For the kids.
Joey Tribbiani,"It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn't have said. But believe me, that's not gonna happen today."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I said that I..."
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys, this is Shelley, she's interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends..."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,No thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,How come you have two?
Joey Tribbiani,Get out.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
Joey Tribbiani,No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
Joey Tribbiani,Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Look!
Joey Tribbiani,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
Joey Tribbiani,All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
Joey Tribbiani,"Judge rules, no violation."
Joey Tribbiani,And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Joey Tribbiani,"Judge rules, Nutter-Butter."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right I stepped up! She's my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I'd pee on anyone of you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends."
Joey Tribbiani,Really? Me? Wow! I don't even know any huge gay people!
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
Joey Tribbiani,I think face to face.
Joey Tribbiani,"Face to face, yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
Joey Tribbiani,No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Joey Tribbiani,"It's not what you said. It's the way you said it... Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Great nap.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin'?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! How you doin'?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how you doin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I do. How you doin?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?!?! Oh dear God!
Joey Tribbiani,Not much to tell there I'm really shy.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh great! Great! Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,Bye-bye. I did it!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y'know?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, good to know. So close!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Little bit, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, that's just a little something for my huge gay fan base."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you're the one that loves the picture."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!"
Joey Tribbiani,But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Let's play Bamboozled!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, isn't that a cool name?"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?"
Joey Tribbiani,"It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card."
Joey Tribbiani,"I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower."
Joey Tribbiani,This is embarrassing.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath."
Joey Tribbiani,"No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris...Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?"
Joey Tribbiani,This one right here.
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, fear of the number 13."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right Chandler, you're up."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
Joey Tribbiani,You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Joey Tribbiani,"Choose, you jackass!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!"
Joey Tribbiani,"In what John Houston film would you hear this line, ""Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wise choice, how many rungs?"
Joey Tribbiani,That noise can only me one thing.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!"
Joey Tribbiani,Of course!
Joey Tribbiani,Who invented bifocals?
Joey Tribbiani,Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Joey Tribbiani,"Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, over to Chandler."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you sure?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!"
Joey Tribbiani,It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Joey Tribbiani,Rightie-O Ray!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?"
Joey Tribbiani,What-Why?!
Joey Tribbiani,Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
Joey Tribbiani,Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
Joey Tribbiani,Let's play Bamboozled!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. ""Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?"
Joey Tribbiani,I thought you already have a job.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Joey Tribbiani,What is it?
Joey Tribbiani,You cooked him?
Joey Tribbiani,"Either eat it, or be in it."
Joey Tribbiani,Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
Joey Tribbiani,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,"When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?"
Joey Tribbiani,Cheese makes me thirsty.
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,"I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time."
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, this was a stupid idea."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's a poster for that World War I movie that I'm in, check it out."
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh! I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you! I'm in THX! I'm unsuitable for children!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, it's already generating Oscar buzz."
Joey Tribbiani,I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you're all invited!
Joey Tribbiani,Sure! Why not?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God. So that's it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Joey Tribbiani,Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Joey Tribbiani,You said you didn't want to go.
Joey Tribbiani,Definitely not invisible.
Joey Tribbiani,Well uh...I think I want to take Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn't believe in myself."
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna go shave.
Joey Tribbiani,A little tall.
Joey Tribbiani,"Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? There you go."
Joey Tribbiani,"""I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, this is it. It's my big fight scene coming up."
Joey Tribbiani,You liked it? You really liked it?
Joey Tribbiani,Which part exactly?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?"
Joey Tribbiani,You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! That's for coming buddy. I'll see you later.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You've done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Give me a number, I don't want to owe you anything!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah-ah-ah! We're doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, so that's another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that's..."
Joey Tribbiani,Please!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, what else?"
Joey Tribbiani,Which we're still keeping under our hats!
Joey Tribbiani,"What the hell are you talking about, ""The south will rise again man."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! You made it!
Joey Tribbiani,You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
Joey Tribbiani,What?! Are you crazy?!
Joey Tribbiani,God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and... I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?"
Joey Tribbiani,Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey I got one! I got one!
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, you gotta press the button."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray."
Joey Tribbiani,Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!"
Joey Tribbiani,"816, thank you!"
Joey Tribbiani,And what is his name?
Joey Tribbiani,Great! Go get him.
Joey Tribbiani,He's not really my type.
Joey Tribbiani,But you said he was this great guy!
Joey Tribbiani,You do attract some stinkers.
Joey Tribbiani,Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, but I'm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me."
Joey Tribbiani,"That was a test. Good response. All right, full name."
Joey Tribbiani,Date of birth?
Joey Tribbiani,Age?
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. And uh, are you married."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Joey Tribbiani,"Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oooh, wrong answer."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, well he's 33."
Joey Tribbiani,A widower.
Joey Tribbiani,"He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually."
Joey Tribbiani,"Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist."
Joey Tribbiani,Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!"
Joey Tribbiani,Right!
Joey Tribbiani,Me neither.
Joey Tribbiani,There she is!
Joey Tribbiani,She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and...uh-oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good."
Joey Tribbiani,What's the matter now?
Joey Tribbiani,What was the other one Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
Joey Tribbiani,What is it? Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach come on, what?"
Joey Tribbiani,What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I guess so."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen."
Joey Tribbiani,You don't have to worry about that okay?
Joey Tribbiani,Sure.
Joey Tribbiani,My God.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh... Look Rach... Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?"
Joey Tribbiani,Dude I just did something terrible.
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!"
Joey Tribbiani,Because it kinda looked like I did.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand."
Joey Tribbiani,It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
Joey Tribbiani,I guess.
Joey Tribbiani,I know! I know it's awful.
Joey Tribbiani,She said yes.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I like that. Yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Now let's not get carried away.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later."
Joey Tribbiani,"It can't be me, I'm standing right here."
Joey Tribbiani,We're not peeking?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya."
Joey Tribbiani,Yowsa!
Joey Tribbiani,Dear Lord.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that."
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, I don't really know her."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kidding me?!
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
Joey Tribbiani,"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out."
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her."
Joey Tribbiani,"You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out."
Joey Tribbiani,I can come back.
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, technically, I didn't."
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!"
Joey Tribbiani,I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Joey Tribbiani,"It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, this is awkward."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, step up! I proposed."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you're not going to propose!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, it's beautiful."
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that...Man! That kid is going to town!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye."
Joey Tribbiani,"This isn't the right room, sorry folks."
Joey Tribbiani,Why're you so tired?
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey so where's Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,Is he still mad at us?
Joey Tribbiani,That's not fair! I can't do that.
Joey Tribbiani,"See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this."
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong."
Joey Tribbiani,I said I didn't technically.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know I should've. ""I'm sorry."""
Joey Tribbiani,"No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes."
Joey Tribbiani,A little bit.
Joey Tribbiani,Little bit.
Joey Tribbiani,A little bit more.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, hit me."
Joey Tribbiani,Hit me.
Joey Tribbiani,Hit me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hit me, hit me."
Joey Tribbiani,Hit me! Hit me!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
Joey Tribbiani,"I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!"
Joey Tribbiani,You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
Joey Tribbiani,"Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. ""Oops."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, so how is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Your thumb? That's weird. You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Joey Tribbiani,"You, you want me to help you with that?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's pretty, Okay date of birth?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, May...tember."
Joey Tribbiani,Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?"
Joey Tribbiani,But you two were supposed to be together.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody."
Joey Tribbiani,So?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,And you're Okay with that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just ""anybody."""
Joey Tribbiani,"""Thanks."""
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this?"
Joey Tribbiani,How long do you have to go for?
Joey Tribbiani,A year?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week."
Joey Tribbiani,We were gonna go see the Jets!
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you guys are moving.
Joey Tribbiani,Here you are.
Joey Tribbiani,
Joey Tribbiani,Uhuh.
Joey Tribbiani,
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot."
Joey Tribbiani,"I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Poophack...
Joey Tribbiani,
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?"
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Mike.
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
Joey Tribbiani,
Joey Tribbiani,Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!
Joey Tribbiani,MIKE!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!
Joey Tribbiani,"Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike."
Joey Tribbiani,Atta boy!
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, look..."
Joey Tribbiani,From school.
Joey Tribbiani,"Mike, 'attorney at law'!"
Joey Tribbiani,What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Joey Tribbiani,Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great! Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Please, we're trying to have a conversation."
Joey Tribbiani,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,"Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!"
Joey Tribbiani,What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
Joey Tribbiani,"Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!"
Joey Tribbiani,You're leaving too?
Joey Tribbiani,Good night!
Joey Tribbiani,

Joey Tribbiani,Double promise? Call me when you land.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, bye."

Joey Tribbiani,Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Joey Tribbiani,Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Joey Tribbiani,"And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ..."
Joey Tribbiani,Son of a bitch!
Joey Tribbiani,"Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want."
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, control your woman!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what is going on with you two?"
Joey Tribbiani,"So? Did have sex, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"See ya. Well, this is just us."
Joey Tribbiani,"Do, do you gonna do it now?"
Joey Tribbiani,No-ohoh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special."
Joey Tribbiani,Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Joey Tribbiani,Joey! Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,That's the best birthday ever.
Joey Tribbiani,"Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?"
Joey Tribbiani,Seriously? She actually said that?
Joey Tribbiani,Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Joey Tribbiani,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
Joey Tribbiani,Fire trucks!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
Joey Tribbiani,That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
Joey Tribbiani,Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,"So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is..."
Joey Tribbiani,...No...
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like..."
Joey Tribbiani,Heeeyy! Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah....
Joey Tribbiani,Not knowing when to shut up...
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns."
Joey Tribbiani,Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
Joey Tribbiani,Me! I'm up for puppets!
Joey Tribbiani,I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Joey Tribbiani,I am learning so much from you.
Joey Tribbiani,Allright. See you later!
Joey Tribbiani,Did that guy really make that joke?
Joey Tribbiani,What kind?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! You blow my mind...
Joey Tribbiani,Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Joey Tribbiani,It's like the cheapest college ever.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: ""Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird."" Or... or maybe just a wing or..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Real estate, huh? Hmmm..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey dude, what's up?"
Joey Tribbiani,Did you take that tape?
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Joey Tribbiani,She hot?
Joey Tribbiani,How did she get me to settle down?
Joey Tribbiani,"Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya..."
Joey Tribbiani,What? Whoo... What?
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing."
Joey Tribbiani,You don't wanna see what I just saw!
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later."
Joey Tribbiani,"wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.
Joey Tribbiani,"I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Ross and Rachels Apartment.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs!
Joey Tribbiani,I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today."
Joey Tribbiani,I do not.
Joey Tribbiani,"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you."
Joey Tribbiani,Uh..
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.. man.. Ross and Rachel's Apartment.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, I still need some help here."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe I won.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Joey Tribbiani,"I lie better then that, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency."
Joey Tribbiani,"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door."
Joey Tribbiani,Setting the table.
Joey Tribbiani,ooh oooh..
Joey Tribbiani,What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually its not pies, its just pie."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows."
Joey Tribbiani,Why do I smell men's cologne?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Joey Tribbiani,I guess not.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?"
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,"What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, ""Duh."""
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head."
Joey Tribbiani,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. Here's your ticket.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks man.
Joey Tribbiani,Where are you going?
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?"
Joey Tribbiani,I *love* my job.
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, these are for you."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
Joey Tribbiani,They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
Joey Tribbiani,Got ya.
Joey Tribbiani,Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!
Joey Tribbiani,": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?"
Joey Tribbiani,If you want I could loan you some money?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
Joey Tribbiani,No it is awesome!
Joey Tribbiani,She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" Okay, So He Said ""If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."""
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
Joey Tribbiani,Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay."
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
Joey Tribbiani,Nice.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight."
Joey Tribbiani,He slept with you and then never called you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!"
Joey Tribbiani,Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?"
Joey Tribbiani,You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. So where's Mon?
Joey Tribbiani,And you're not helping?
Joey Tribbiani,"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you too."
Joey Tribbiani,How do you think she's doing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
Joey Tribbiani,Sure.
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!
Joey Tribbiani,Fine.
Joey Tribbiani,For a walk.
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts."
Joey Tribbiani,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?"
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Joey Tribbiani,Fine ... mediocre porn.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later."
Joey Tribbiani,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I didn't go to college."
Joey Tribbiani,Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Joey Tribbiani,Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Joey Tribbiani,"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again."
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,"It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
Joey Tribbiani,On...?
Joey Tribbiani,Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Joey Tribbiani,Arghhh! Double standards!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler Bing.
Joey Tribbiani,OK Thanks.. I touched the stuff.
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh good...
Joey Tribbiani,All right let's just do this.
Joey Tribbiani,Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I need your help."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped."
Joey Tribbiani,"You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!"
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures."
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell am I supposed to do!
Joey Tribbiani,"What, what."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!"
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you so much.
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
Joey Tribbiani,Comb my eyelashes.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ha, oh, of course."
Joey Tribbiani,Your eyebrows look weird.
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning, roomie!"
Joey Tribbiani,Fifth day's a charm.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?"
Joey Tribbiani,She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, hey, it's been great."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! So, how are you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, actually it..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, really?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, I know lots of girls."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, names? Opening credits."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
Joey Tribbiani,Why are they doing this?
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."
Joey Tribbiani,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, that's a great plan!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Who is he?
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my god, you're right!"
Joey Tribbiani,She even reads for pleasure!
Joey Tribbiani,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Joey Tribbiani,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else."
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh...I hear that's bad.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, yes, The Plan!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,Emma? Hey! Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
Joey Tribbiani,Because you two were having sex!
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
Joey Tribbiani,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name."
Joey Tribbiani,You almost had me.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh.
Joey Tribbiani,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
Joey Tribbiani,"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding."
Joey Tribbiani,Where?
Joey Tribbiani,Can you believe they're still not here?
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
Joey Tribbiani,We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. ... and I smelled bacon.
Joey Tribbiani,Who did?
Joey Tribbiani,She did?
Joey Tribbiani,I did?
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, but it sounds great."
Joey Tribbiani,With Lennart Haze?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, and directing."
Joey Tribbiani,Ah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's done some amazing works."
Joey Tribbiani,I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
Joey Tribbiani,Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
Joey Tribbiani,It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
Joey Tribbiani,"Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yah, sure."
Joey Tribbiani,"Err, ""I think you know""."
Joey Tribbiani,"""I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."""
Joey Tribbiani,"""I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."""
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern ""I could go right now, maaan!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,I really doubt that.
Joey Tribbiani,Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less."
Joey Tribbiani,Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
Joey Tribbiani,I give you $ 500 for them!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?"
Joey Tribbiani,But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, I really need."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes... ahahaaa.
Joey Tribbiani,"""I think you know!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"""I am what you made me! You know what?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"""I could go right now."""
Joey Tribbiani,"""I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"""
Joey Tribbiani,I did?
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"
Joey Tribbiani,We gotta get more of that.
Joey Tribbiani,"""I need an answer!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"""You know!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"""I need an answer now!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,"""You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for Bang End Scene!"""
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong."
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake."
Joey Tribbiani,And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh...how much?
Joey Tribbiani,Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Joey Tribbiani,That's right I am!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Oo...what's in the bag?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!"
Joey Tribbiani,You're gonna do it?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, women can. You can't."
Joey Tribbiani,The hardware store is right down the street.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know."
Joey Tribbiani,"Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad."
Joey Tribbiani,That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Joey Tribbiani,Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Joey Tribbiani,I am on fire! Chandler : Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
Joey Tribbiani,Err... Kind of.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her."
Joey Tribbiani,Something personal.
Joey Tribbiani,Boob job.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy."
Joey Tribbiani,Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
Joey Tribbiani,Because she is!
Joey Tribbiani,Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
Joey Tribbiani,OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?"
Joey Tribbiani,Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Joey Tribbiani,AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"
Joey Tribbiani,Dude!
Joey Tribbiani,aaand SEND! Opening credits.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!"
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount..."
Joey Tribbiani,Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
Joey Tribbiani,"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy."
Joey Tribbiani,There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
Joey Tribbiani,Make the transfer!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."
Joey Tribbiani,But he's the same.
Joey Tribbiani,But he's the same.
Joey Tribbiani,He's the same! .
Joey Tribbiani,You're not the same!
Joey Tribbiani,Original or crappy?
Joey Tribbiani,"No, sorry haven't seen him."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's Monica, ok?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.."
Joey Tribbiani,... she's being unreasonable!
Joey Tribbiani,It does?
Joey Tribbiani,Really? She... she loves me?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him."
Joey Tribbiani,Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Joey Tribbiani,How do you think I got him in the first place?
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?"
Joey Tribbiani,Alright!
Joey Tribbiani,A place to entertain my lady friends.
Joey Tribbiani,A place to eat spaghetti.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so..."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"
Joey Tribbiani,I like those odds!
Joey Tribbiani,What's that now? Opening credits.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
Joey Tribbiani,I was?
Joey Tribbiani,I did?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! Tough odds!
Joey Tribbiani,Look who's coming around!
Joey Tribbiani,Did you get it?
Joey Tribbiani,By you!?
Joey Tribbiani,I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Joey Tribbiani,I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
Joey Tribbiani,Can't really say!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Joey Tribbiani,"I won, hey!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward."
Joey Tribbiani,You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'll show you how.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. TV: ""Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"""
Joey Tribbiani,And what did she say?
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit! anybody got anything?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that is so great about the job."
Joey Tribbiani,And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Me too.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won."
Joey Tribbiani,"God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do. Joey: I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
Joey Tribbiani,"Right!""Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"""
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
Joey Tribbiani,Also so gay!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, wish me luck!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
Joey Tribbiani,"Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!"
Joey Tribbiani,"but, but.."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Joey Tribbiani,"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!"
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
Joey Tribbiani,"A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
Joey Tribbiani,So...I've never played that!
Joey Tribbiani,Uh...well...just once...with you...
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell are you talking about??
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Joey: Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! Closing credits."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life""."
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, here you go."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,What's happenin'?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first."
Joey Tribbiani,Stupid Jane Rogers!!
Joey Tribbiani,Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Joey Tribbiani,I do it every year.
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah...
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah...
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Joey Tribbiani,"You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8."
Joey Tribbiani,What party?
Joey Tribbiani,Ok... I mean...
Joey Tribbiani,Nice to meet ya!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it Thanks for coming."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. Dirk, this is my good friend Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,Monica!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Joey: Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
Joey Tribbiani,Gotcha.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close? Opening credits."
Joey Tribbiani,Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
Joey Tribbiani,Heeey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on in, how are ya?"
Joey Tribbiani,Can I offer you a drink?
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if you need a tour guide..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?"
Joey Tribbiani,Ok!
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees."
Joey Tribbiani,"Which one, they all suck!"
Joey Tribbiani,I don't think so.
Joey Tribbiani,Ross!
Joey Tribbiani,I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo..."
Joey Tribbiani,Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Joey Tribbiani,"EH, what do you know!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,The Metsss!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
Joey Tribbiani,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?"
Joey Tribbiani,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right."
Joey Tribbiani,Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
Joey Tribbiani,Phonetically?
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
Joey Tribbiani,"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ."
Joey Tribbiani,Come on! you...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,You're ready?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work."
Joey Tribbiani,"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh hey Rach!
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What's the matter, Pheebs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."
Joey Tribbiani,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, have a good time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!"
Joey Tribbiani,Bye.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?"
Joey Tribbiani,So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Joey Tribbiani,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! How's it going?
Joey Tribbiani,What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, just wake him up!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?"
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Joey Tribbiani,Then don't go!
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Joey Tribbiani,Mmh-mmh.
Joey Tribbiani,Barbados!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!"
Joey Tribbiani,That... never happens...
Joey Tribbiani,"No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives""."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray."
Joey Tribbiani,You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
Joey Tribbiani,You really should have been more clear about that!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Joey Tribbiani,"You could say: ""Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"""
Joey Tribbiani,Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Joey Tribbiani,Will you wear a thong?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, why?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man!
Joey Tribbiani,"I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Joey Tribbiani,"Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys!
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Oh! Secret teapot?"
Joey Tribbiani,It's really gone?
Joey Tribbiani,I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? ."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it hasn't come to that yet."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know we're not, but Frank Medeio and... Eva Trorro... womba..."
Joey Tribbiani,Kate Miller it is.
Joey Tribbiani,In that case should I make sure it's on real good?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun."
Joey Tribbiani,"Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
Joey Tribbiani,"But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?"
Joey Tribbiani,"There it is, you're blushing!"
Joey Tribbiani,You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?
Joey Tribbiani,Tell me who it is.
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, who is that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who..."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Night.
Joey Tribbiani,"He said ""erectus""!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, he really said it."
Joey Tribbiani,Erectus?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and so funny!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! A little bit, yeah..."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey...
Joey Tribbiani,Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, she said we have nothing in common."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's not, we have nothing in common!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, Rach!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"
Joey Tribbiani,But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!"
Joey Tribbiani,You like me?
Joey Tribbiani,That's a huge thing!
Joey Tribbiani,What... for how long?
Joey Tribbiani,A MONTH??
Joey Tribbiani,I just have one question!
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell are you doin'???
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he had a paper route."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"
Joey Tribbiani,"NO, NO! It can't happen at all!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!"
Joey Tribbiani,"NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!"
Joey Tribbiani,NO BIG DEAL!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,No idea what it means.
Joey Tribbiani,I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Joey Tribbiani,Is he gone?
Joey Tribbiani,Pssst...
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he's with Charlie now."
Joey Tribbiani,"You're a pain in my ass, Geller!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off..."
Joey Tribbiani,I like although!
Joey Tribbiani,Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Joey Tribbiani,Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm thinking about you...
Joey Tribbiani,Let's forget about Ross...
Joey Tribbiani,What's wrong?
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, maybe I can help."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?"
Joey Tribbiani,I understand...
Joey Tribbiani,I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh...
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,You kissed.
Joey Tribbiani,I saw you.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah... Now I have something...
Joey Tribbiani,Oh... uh... look... before you...
Joey Tribbiani,"I am those things, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Dude!
Joey Tribbiani,I can't think of anything.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory."
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together."
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Good night!
Joey Tribbiani,Good night!
Joey Tribbiani,Stop saying good night.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, he just saw us."
Joey Tribbiani,"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie."
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but it did happen, so..."
Joey Tribbiani,Ross?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no!"
Joey Tribbiani,Probably.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no!"
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Ross..
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
Joey Tribbiani,I do like fajitas.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
Joey Tribbiani,In a carriage!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Charlie!"

Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, actually, that's.."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?"

Joey Tribbiani,"It doesn't look good, does it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Morning. Here you go.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.."
Joey Tribbiani,"It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's what I hear, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, I mean, you know me, you know..."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm crazy about her.
Joey Tribbiani,I think so.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?"
Joey Tribbiani,And we're okay?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. It's actually our first official date.
Joey Tribbiani,"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at."
Joey Tribbiani,It's OK!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh."
Joey Tribbiani,"NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this."
Joey Tribbiani,More foosball?
Joey Tribbiani,"I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?"
Joey Tribbiani,What's the matter?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't get it, Chandler loved it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, was that good for you?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, you sure you wanna do this?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, yeah, got it."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,This thing welded shut?!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing."
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!"
Joey Tribbiani,Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Joey Tribbiani,NAH! I don't have another level!!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!"
Joey Tribbiani,Uh!
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,uh uh!
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!"
Joey Tribbiani,Soldier down!
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I know what's the matter with me."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it."
Joey Tribbiani,That's a... pla-an.
Joey Tribbiani,Wow... I did not see this coming.
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted."
Joey Tribbiani,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Joey Tribbiani,So...
Joey Tribbiani,I love ya.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, me too."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"18, uh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What, what!? it's for her hot friends!"
Joey Tribbiani,And starting to think about settling down!
Joey Tribbiani,I'd love to! Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,We were supposed to bring presents?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""! Yeah... that's a funny cup!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!"
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I think Emma might like it!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Um, my present!"
Joey Tribbiani,Actually we prepared performances.
Joey Tribbiani,But equally real!
Joey Tribbiani,O K.
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!"
Joey Tribbiani,I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, ""Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression"" eesh! ""Love you forever"". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be"". . And while he rocked her, he sang ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be""."
Joey Tribbiani,Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Joey Tribbiani,I'm so confused!
Joey Tribbiani,Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it."
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Ok!
Joey Tribbiani,Nighty-night!
Joey Tribbiani,"Bye, bye."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?"

Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!"
Joey Tribbiani,I've been here the whole time!
Joey Tribbiani,What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
Joey Tribbiani,Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!"
Joey Tribbiani,"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight."
Joey Tribbiani,Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Joey Tribbiani,"I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... ""Dear baby adoption decider people..."""
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Always nice to meet a fan!
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so..."
Joey Tribbiani,What did I just say?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... ""brainy, bright, clever"", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn."
Joey Tribbiani,Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
Joey Tribbiani,Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
Joey Tribbiani,Yep!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude."
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?"
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,You slept out here?
Joey Tribbiani,"But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said ""Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!"
Joey Tribbiani,'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, Monica made us!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeaah.
Joey Tribbiani,"I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,"No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!"
Joey Tribbiani,Whoo-hoo!

Joey Tribbiani,"Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hi sweetie!
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Cool!
Joey Tribbiani,"That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"I can do that! ""Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..."" Oh, what's the product?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm cold!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Joey Tribbiani,"What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in."
Joey Tribbiani,"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!"
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,Damn it!
Joey Tribbiani,Just pass it to your boss!
Joey Tribbiani,What's up?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"But, ehm... you watched the tape?"
Joey Tribbiani,You didn't watch the tape.
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you lied again!"
Joey Tribbiani,Keep going Pinocchio!
Joey Tribbiani,No you didn't!
Joey Tribbiani,You still here?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!"
Joey Tribbiani,You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
Joey Tribbiani,"Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan."
Joey Tribbiani,And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Joey Tribbiani,But it's an original Buffay...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Joey Tribbiani,GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Joey Tribbiani,That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
Joey Tribbiani,"Now, what do you say?"
Joey Tribbiani,And?... AND?
Joey Tribbiani,Gladys?
Joey Tribbiani,You're mean!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity."
Joey Tribbiani,Celebrity.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
Joey Tribbiani,"Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe..."
Joey Tribbiani,Guys!?
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?
Joey Tribbiani,Everything doesn't sound fine!

Joey Tribbiani,Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they're great seats too!"
Joey Tribbiani,Center ice.
Joey Tribbiani,"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, two times that happened!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's some gentle comedy, dude."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Bob, get off the guy!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair."
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know...
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,How late are we?
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!"
Joey Tribbiani,You are not at Thanksgiving?
Joey Tribbiani,We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, where were you!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before..."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae."
Joey Tribbiani,No. Here.
Joey Tribbiani,Who do you think its from?
Joey Tribbiani,"I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning."
Joey Tribbiani,Ah-haah! I win!!
Joey Tribbiani,That's fire. Beats everything.
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played."
Joey Tribbiani,I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
Joey Tribbiani,WATER BALLOON!
Joey Tribbiani,"Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us."
Joey Tribbiani,I'm telling ya... I can do it.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible."
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Joey Tribbiani,Don't make me come up there!
Joey Tribbiani,Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Joey Tribbiani,Sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!"
Joey Tribbiani,Ha!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Joey Tribbiani,No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Joey Tribbiani,aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something."
Joey Tribbiani,I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that smells good!"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,It isn't working.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!"
Joey Tribbiani,Interesting...
Joey Tribbiani,I left them at the park.
Joey Tribbiani,It's really starting to hurt.
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! Come on!
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I've got food all over me."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I know how you feel..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!"
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!"
Joey Tribbiani,"But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,So... who's your friend?
Joey Tribbiani,"OW, why, why, why?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with."
Joey Tribbiani,"Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?"

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent."
Joey Tribbiani,ALL FOOD!
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!"
Joey Tribbiani,JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Joey Tribbiani,"I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?"

Joey Tribbiani,"I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, stuffed clams."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake."
Joey Tribbiani,"So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, sure. No problem."

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?"
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!"
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?"
Joey Tribbiani,Strike two!
Joey Tribbiani,"Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hello Michael.
Joey Tribbiani,"May I have a word with you, please?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this."
Joey Tribbiani,"More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."""
Joey Tribbiani,"I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her."
Joey Tribbiani,"That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family."
Joey Tribbiani,That was ME!
Joey Tribbiani,I'm glad we had this little talk.
Joey Tribbiani,How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what are you guys gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,"The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels."
Joey Tribbiani,I don't think they are.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah according to the news, most of the city did."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh..."
Joey Tribbiani,"I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do."
Joey Tribbiani,"Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay...
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?"
Joey Tribbiani,I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
Joey Tribbiani,"It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help."
Joey Tribbiani,"I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my resume, I'm fluent in."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play."
Joey Tribbiani,Je de coup Clow.

Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, sure. Ok, ""Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"" See?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part."
Joey Tribbiani,"For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!"

Joey Tribbiani,Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Would fall off a lot.
Joey Tribbiani,That I can do.
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey guys.
Joey Tribbiani,"No, thank you."
Joey Tribbiani,"But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map."
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing"". What is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
Joey Tribbiani,"Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus."
Joey Tribbiani,Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark."
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter."
Joey Tribbiani,"FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..."
Joey Tribbiani,no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm.
Joey Tribbiani,Ow!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,"I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea."
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?"
Joey Tribbiani,"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, I guess."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, maybe."
Joey Tribbiani,"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?"
Joey Tribbiani,Just when I thought we could be friends.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great."
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing."
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Joey Tribbiani,What? I get my own room?
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey bear, I need some career advice."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, great! All right!"
Joey Tribbiani,"What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Phoebe.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm just mad at my agent.
Joey Tribbiani,There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this."
Joey Tribbiani,Ok. Why?
Joey Tribbiani,I love that saying! .
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, actually I am!"
Joey Tribbiani,"That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it."
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm saying that... . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. ."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her."
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again."
Joey Tribbiani,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,You blow me away.
Joey Tribbiani,"I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God. Hello?
Joey Tribbiani,Estelle?
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. ""out of area"". Boy, I'll say."
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody."
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris."
Joey Tribbiani,Just flip!
Joey Tribbiani,Damnit!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Try it, I can't feel a thing!"
Joey Tribbiani,You guys hear a ringing?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!"
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second."
Joey Tribbiani,"Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?"
Joey Tribbiani,What did I just say?
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, I had a chance to stop her too!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute..."
Joey Tribbiani,I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Joey Tribbiani,"Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching."
Joey Tribbiani,I really made you think about that thing uh?
Joey Tribbiani,Lucky bastard!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?"
Joey Tribbiani,I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Who's that dirty old lady?
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on here, have a seat."
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, wait, wait, wait..."
Joey Tribbiani,"If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger."
Joey Tribbiani,A little more.
Joey Tribbiani,"A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot."
Joey Tribbiani,Doesn't work...
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to."
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Joey Tribbiani,So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Joey Tribbiani,"So, so is she still going to Paris?"
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,I bet you did!
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God! What did you say?
Joey Tribbiani,You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language."
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, wait!"
Joey Tribbiani,Could you get me a muffin?
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know what might help?"
Joey Tribbiani,"It's a... It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby."
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I sat in the paint."
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes..."
Joey Tribbiani,Damn it!
Joey Tribbiani,"You know, the baby can't read, Mike!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, so what is the big surprise?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica."
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, maybe that's for the best."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you are!"
Joey Tribbiani,This is so cool!
Joey Tribbiani,"But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Good luck, good luck!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?"
Joey Tribbiani,Alright!
Joey Tribbiani,Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
Joey Tribbiani,"Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack..."
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,You stepped on my egg roll?
Joey Tribbiani,Just put it on a plate and leave.
Joey Tribbiani,Alright.
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait, wait. Do you hear that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! They're in the table!
Joey Tribbiani,We gotta get them out of there!
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little."
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,Oh God! So what do we do?
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. ""Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."""
Joey Tribbiani,It did not.
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there."
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Here goes.
Joey Tribbiani,I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?"
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, here we go. I can't do it."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!"
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
Joey Tribbiani,What?
Joey Tribbiani,I could get a goose!
Joey Tribbiani,"Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit."
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?"
Joey Tribbiani,I love you!
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,So did you guys make it in time?
Joey Tribbiani,Has it always been purple?
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. I guess so.
